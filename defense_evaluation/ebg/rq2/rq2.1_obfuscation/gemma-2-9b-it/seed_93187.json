            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aspiration to pursue social work stems from a deep-seated desire to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicating my efforts to supporting children who have endured abuse or neglect and providing crucial assistance to families facing challenges.  The core values that I believe I can contribute to this field are service, respect, ethical conduct, and a steadfast commitment to fostering improved relationships both within families and within the broader community.  Moreover, I am dedicated to continuous professional development, ensuring I remain well-equipped and knowledgeable in my chosen field.  These values are not merely professional ideals; they are deeply ingrained in my personal philosophy.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have always felt a strong call to assist others, though my specific path remained unclear. Observing individuals grappling with difficulties, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, fueled my desire to make a meaningful difference. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and its complexities.  Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took some time to reflect and explore different avenues.\n\nOne summer day, a chance encounter with a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. This experience profoundly impacted me, prompting me to reach out to the boy's parents in an attempt to offer support and advocate for his well-being. While legal intervention was not immediately possible, my conversation with the parents revealed their own struggles and a reluctance to acknowledge the severity of the situation. This encounter solidified my conviction to pursue a career in social work, where I could directly address the needs of vulnerable children and families facing similar challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value I hold dear and believe is essential to the field of social work.  As a society, we often celebrate individuality while simultaneously adhering to rigid societal norms and expectations. This paradox highlights the need to challenge these norms and advocate for genuine equality and inclusivity. Throughout my academic years, I actively engaged in various forms of activism, expressing my commitment to social justice through my personal style, my involvement with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance (GSBA), and my unwavering stance against racism and discrimination. I believe in fighting for a more equitable and just society and will continue to use my voice and actions to promote these values.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological model centers on genetic predispositions and physiological factors influencing sleep. In contrast, sociocultural models explore the interplay between environmental influences and aspects such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographic background. This review will analyze research relevant to both models, elucidating each study's findings and critically evaluating its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders stemming from medical or substance-related factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias involve difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, and sleepwalking disorder. Sleep disorders linked to mental health can arise from either Axis I disorders (clinical disorders) or Axis II disorders (personality disorders or intellectual disabilities). This review will primarily focus on insomnia and, to a lesser extent, primary sleep disorders, analyzing them through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genes, inherited traits, and physiological mechanisms.  Neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, particularly the orexin-producing neurons, plays a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles.  Research utilizing animal models, such as mice, has revealed phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that are implicated in sleep-wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Studies have shown that GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that findings from animal models may be applicable to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Variations or malfunctions in this receptor could potentially disrupt sleep patterns, potentially requiring medication for adequate rest. From a sociocultural perspective, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence an individual's sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could naturally predispose them to sleep difficulties. This could have a profound impact on various aspects of life, including academic performance, professional success, and daily activities requiring sustained attention and focus.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  It begins with a concise definition of the disorder. Next, it delves into the diagnostic process, outlining common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the paper concludes with practical strategies that classroom teachers in inclusive settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD),  describes the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  More specifically, (C)APD refers to the brain's processing of sound information and the neurological activity underlying this processing, leading to specific electrical responses in the auditory system (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Essentially, CAPD is a condition where the brain struggles to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD typically have normal hearing; they can perceive sounds, but the part of the brain responsible for translating those sounds, distinguishing words, and separating speech from background noise, functions differently than usual.\n\nEarly recognition of what would become known as CAPD emerged in the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Researchers examining children with communication difficulties began exploring this concept.   In 1954, an Italian research team, including Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, started developing assessments for these children.  Building on this, Kimura, in 1961, introduced \"dichotic testing\" and proposed a model explaining the physiology of the CNS involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A significant national conference in 1977 spurred further research focused on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways.  Some individuals may have difficulty locating or perceiving sounds in space, distinguishing between two or more sounds, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech (such as recognizing sarcasm based on changes in tone). They might struggle to filter out background noise, synthesize auditory cues (interpreting sounds meaningfully), or determine the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive process that includes observing listening behaviors and evaluating auditory function through a range of tests conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other qualified professionals (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These evaluations may incorporate questionnaires, surveys, observations of auditory behaviors, and responses to specific auditory stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted test for diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many assessments present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and require them to differentiate specific elements, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the intricate consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a tool for deception, ultimately, individuals must confront their true selves to avoid losing their identity. However, the act of revealing the truth can lead to social isolation.  One must then grapple with a difficult choice: preserving one's authentic self or maintaining relationships with those around them.  Though some may react neutrally to being deceived, others might be deeply hurt and offended by the charade. \n\nThe play delves particularly into the complexities of deception when it involves gender role reversal. A crucial question arises: why do characters choose to adopt a different gender identity? In Viola's case, her decision stems from a need for protection. Arriving in a foreign land, she adopts the guise of a man to safeguard herself from potential harm: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nWhile this strategy proves effective, it simultaneously distances Viola from the female community, severing a vital support system. Ironically, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian, resulting in romantic entanglement: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Moreover, Viola grapples with suppressed feelings for Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nAlthough this dynamic might appear progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on how deception may inadvertently expose hidden emotions. Olivia and Orsino's reactions to Viola/Cesario suggest repressed desires that are brought to the surface. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario rooted in his perceived masculinity, or does it hint at a deeper, perhaps subconscious, inclination towards women?  It's plausible that Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia satirizes the superficial judgments prevalent in his era, as evidenced by her swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her eventual acceptance of Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "The impact of German colonialism on various regions has been widely studied, with particular emphasis on the tragic events surrounding the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa. However, it is crucial to recognize that such a vast and complex empire as Germany's colonial holdings cannot be solely defined by this singular act of brutality. The German colonial experience was characterized by a diverse range of policies and administrative approaches, mirroring the varied geographical landscapes it encompassed.\n\nEducational initiatives across the colonies also exhibited significant variations.  When the British assumed control of German East Africa (later known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable population of educated and literate Africans.  Similarly, German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary scholars.\n\nIn stark contrast to this scenario, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a drastically different picture.  Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government actively established state schools and played a central role in the education of indigenous populations, South West Africa saw native education largely entrusted to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  However, the German administration did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing more substantial funding and oversight to missionary institutions. The ramifications of these divergent educational policies persisted long after the termination of German rule. While other German colonies boasted a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, a vast majority of the population remained unschooled and illiterate.\n\nA confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark contrast in educational outcomes. This study aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing particularly on recent research that sheds light on the attitudes and perspectives of colonial settlers and authorities towards African natives.\n\n\nExisting scholarship on education within the German colonial empire is extensive. A significant portion of these sources are in German and were produced during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary objective of earlier works was to document the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific educational facets. These investigations highlighted significant disparities in the educational structures of different colonies.\n\nA seminal work that directly addresses the theme of this paper is Cohen's study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen juxtaposes the educational systems of these two colonies, exploring the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining many of the unique characteristics of the colony's educational system.\n\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to other German colonies, enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although arid desert regions spanned much of the territory. The European population of South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past century has resulted in a vast and ever-expanding array of genres, making a definitive catalog nearly impossible. This complexity is further amplified by the proliferation of subgenres within each established category – think rock, country, jazz, folk, rap, and countless others.\n\nAmong these, Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most dynamic and expressive genres in the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its capacity to explore a wide spectrum of emotions, often gravitating towards the darker and more intense. This genre's diversity is equally noteworthy, as its early iterations quickly revealed a remarkable malleability, prompting artists to carve out unique subgenres, which in turn spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, creating a constantly evolving landscape.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is characterized by a dizzying array of niches, making it challenging to pinpoint a singular definition of what constitutes \"heavy metal.\"  Despite its diverse influences, the genre undeniably has roots in a specific historical context. To fully comprehend the multifaceted nature of Metal music prevalent today, one must first delve into the origins of the Metal movement itself, understanding its unique trajectory beyond the confines of a mere musical genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is, in many ways, a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It can be perceived as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatrical elements.  It challenges primitivism, prioritizing technical proficiency and skilled musicianship, evident in the intricate compositions and performances of Metal artists.\n\nFurthermore, Metal is undeniably intertwined with the influence of psychedelic drugs. The mid-1970s witnessed a surge in drug use, fueling a creative explosion that resulted in unconventional and boundary-pushing music.  Drugs, in many cases, served as both inspiration and a scapegoat for these sonic explorations.\n\nMetal's dark and visceral qualities were a stark departure from the prevailing trends in popular music at the time, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the human experience. Later generations of Metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's exploration of darkness and emotional intensity, echoing those themes in their own music.\n\nLyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this inherent darkness:\n\n\nThese lyrics, often cited as a harbinger of Heavy Metal, reveal a darker side to the band, characterized by a volatile emotional landscape, potentially influenced by drug use. Considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Heavy Metal, it emerged as a response to the Rolling Stones' own foray into heavier, darker territory.  The Beatles sought to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity, ultimately including \"Helter Skelter\" on their groundbreaking album, The White Album.",
            "Many years before Surrealism emerged with its dreamlike canvases, a painter named Henri Rousseau was diligently crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" transcends the image of a woman awestruck by the wonders of her slumbering world. It also serves as a reflection of Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the outset of his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art community. Yet, he faced a profound internal conflict: should he conform to prevailing artistic trends to gain approval from the critical world he deeply admired, or should he embrace his own unique vision, forging an independent path?  \n\n\"The Dream\" stands as the culmination of this lifelong struggle within Rousseau's artistic soul. To truly grasp its essence, one must delve into the artist's life story.  Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau's early life was far removed from the world of art. His father, a prosperous businessman, offered no formal artistic training. Instead, Rousseau worked for the French government as a toll collector until the age of forty. Despite this unconventional background, a profound personal tragedy – the loss of his wife and eight young children – compelled him to seek solace in painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau, a true folk artist, captured the hopes and dreams of ordinary people.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance within the art world is understandable when viewed through the lens of his circumstances.  His late start in art, coupled with his lack of formal training, placed him at a disadvantage amidst a generation of talented and celebrated artists.  Even as his artistic career progressed, recognition eluded him until around the same time that Henri Matisse began to establish himself as a leading figure in the art world. Author Jan Gordon, in her book \"Modern French Painters,\" illuminates the stark contrast between the two artists. While both competed for recognition, Gordon argues that their motivations and approaches were fundamentally different: Matisse, driven by a fear of producing commonplace art, and Rousseau, who longed to create works so conventional that they would grant him entry into the prestigious “Artiste Français.”",
            "Throughout history, numerous thinkers have explored the intriguing relationship between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental connection between truth and beauty. This belief resonates deeply with me, echoing the sentiment expressed by John Keats in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge stems from formal education or personal experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics appears to be more intuitive. As Keats implies, these concepts seem to be grasped instinctively rather than through conventional learning. \n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics, in essence, strive to describe rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty primarily aim to elucidate the reasons behind the captivating nature of a work of art or literature, or the ethical implications of certain actions. These pursuits are less about establishing rigid rules for artistic creation or moral conduct and more about illuminating the underlying principles that govern these realms.\n\nFurthermore, critical analysis of art or morals often falls short of fully capturing their essence.  For instance, dissecting the merits of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might involve examining elements like composition, lighting, or historical context, yet these factors alone fail to fully explain its artistic merit. When asked about a cherished piece of art or literature, we frequently find ourselves uttering phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" before delving into more elaborate explanations. This suggests that art and morals possess an intangible quality that transcends mere description.  \n\nSimilar to Flannery O'Connor's assertion that \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\"  literature and art possess an inherent depth that defies complete articulation. No matter how meticulously we analyze their elements, a certain ineffable quality remains. I believe ethics shares this same characteristic. As Wittgenstein states, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" This elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, arguably constitutes the most compelling aspect of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that establishes a profound connection between them.\n\nThe profound link between morality and art stems from our deeply personal and experiential engagement with both. They resonate with us on a level that transcends mere intellectual comprehension. This connection is particularly evident in literature.  As McKean aptly observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its distinct culture woven through its diverse landscapes. From the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel, a shared cultural identity prevails. This cultural tapestry can be traced along the Rhine River, passing through Cologne and reaching the historic Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this rich cultural heritage, it's not surprising that contemporary Germany emerged from a confluence of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people is known as Germania. The origins of the name remain a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a renowned Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before their westward migration and subsequent conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often engaging in skirmishes (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Caesar's use of the term may have originated from the Gauls themselves, who employed it to distinguish their enemies. In the opening chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories suggest the name \"Germania\" might relate to the spear, known as a \"ger,\" used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly derive from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying a boisterous or noisy nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" Tacitus, the Roman historian, described the origins of the German people.  He argued that the Germans were an indigenous population, distinct from other races and unmixed through migration or intermingling.  He wrote: \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\n\nDuring the first century AD, Germanic tribes resided along the fringes of the Roman Empire. They traded goods obtained from their lands and contributed to the Roman army, offering their skills as soldiers (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).  While Romans ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely remained within the confines of their vast empire.",
            "The scene below held me captive, my mind absorbing the details without truly processing them. It was a detached observation, a practiced gaze that analyzed without engaging. Thoughts flickered in and out of awareness, fleeting and ephemeral. My consciousness moved with such fluidity, it felt as though I were merely experiencing, rather than thinking.\n\nI had once attempted to learn to draw, inspired by an artist I knew. I picked up a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" hoping to unlock the secrets of artistic expression. It covered everything from the fundamentals of drawing to the intricate workings of the brain's visual perception. One technique it emphasized was the use of a frame, a way of simplifying complex images. Imagine a bustling kitchen scene, a bowl of fruit on a table, and with a mental frame, you isolate just the fruit, transforming the overwhelming into the manageable.\n\nBut at that moment, staring down at the bowl before me, I couldn't summon that mental frame. I was overwhelmed, awestruck.  Artists like Picasso and Monet, masters of color and form, had their signature styles. If I dared to dream of artistic expression, this was where it would begin, my own unique story unfolding.\n\nMy hand hovered over the object of my artistic endeavor, muscles tensed and released as I moved. My mind's intent took shape in a moment that felt charged with creative possibility. Water swirled, a serene and flawless expanse, crystal clear and pure. Particles detached from the whole and vanished into nothingness.  \n\nMuscles tightened, spasmed, and jerked with a growing unease. My hand struck the toilet handle again, a forceful thrust.  The stubborn brown mass resisted, clinging stubbornly to the porcelain.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie a constricting band around my neck, I frowned. My gaze fell on the unwelcome offering left behind, a reminder of the unsavory reality of cleaning bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper, mummifying itself like an oven mitt. Rising to my feet, then bending at the waist, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a slow, deliberate movement, like a mother venturing into a hot oven.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage fatalities on the road demands our immediate attention.  Several contributing factors converge to create a dangerous situation for young drivers. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health highlights the developmental immaturity of the adolescent brain, which is not fully equipped to handle the complexities and risks associated with driving.  In addition to this biological factor, the undeniable reality of inexperience plays a crucial role. This lack of experience not only elevates the likelihood of fatal accidents but also increases the incidence of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly exacerbates the risks faced by young drivers.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center established a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents involving teen drivers.\n\nRecognizing this urgent need for intervention, several states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses designed to mitigate these dangers. These licenses impose restrictions on driving hours and prohibit younger passengers.  \n\nHowever, while these measures offer a temporary solution, they fail to address the fundamental issue: the inherent vulnerability of young drivers.  Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, a respected psychologist, argues that even the age of 18 is too young to grant unrestricted driving privileges. His research suggests a persistent inclination towards risk-taking among individuals under the age of 20, fueled by a desire for thrill-seeking.  \n\nDelaying the acquisition of a full driver's license until this tendency towards risk-taking diminishes would be a prudent step towards reducing the alarming number of teen driver fatalities.  The looming arrival of a new wave of young drivers, the children of the Baby Boomer generation, presents a significant challenge. By 2010, millions of these teenagers will be eligible to drive, potentially leading to a catastrophic surge in accidents unless we take decisive action.\n\nA comprehensive legislative solution is clearly warranted.  Driver's education could continue to be provided in schools as a foundational step in the learning process.  However, the minimum driving age should be raised to 18, with provisional permits issued prior to granting full driver's licenses.  Practical driving training hours would remain a requirement, building upon the existing standards set by most states.  California, for example, currently mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nUniform, nationwide legislation on this issue would be a logical and effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country.\n\nThe proposal outlined here is not a radical departure from existing practices.",
            "A closer examination of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films revealed a fascinating set of fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901.  These short films primarily relied on clever editing techniques to create captivating illusions. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the stylistic conventions employed in the majority of these trick films, as well as identifying any unique or innovative characteristics present in a few of the later productions. \n\nThe typical trick film of this era adhered to a distinct visual language.  Often set within a confined indoor space framed by a frontal proscenium, these films featured minimal camera movement, relying on long and medium shots.  A significant characteristic was the adherence to a strict principle where a single conceptual shot corresponded to a complete film.  However, a few pioneering works at the dawn of the twentieth century challenged these established norms by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne recurring visual element shared by these trick films is the setting within an interior, enclosed by the boundaries of a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary within this proscenium, refraining from following figures or objects as they moved. This compositional style, common in early cinema, drew inspiration from the theater and, specifically, vaudeville and magic performances. This stage-bound approach, however, imposed limitations on the movement of characters within the films.  They generally moved side-to-side, confined to a horizontal axis and never advancing towards or receding from the camera.  Consider, for example, the action in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side and perform their actions along this horizontal plane, even exiting the frame without the camera pursuing them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also influenced the choice of shot types.  Long shots and, less frequently, medium shots predominated in these films.  Close-ups, a technique that would become commonplace in later filmmaking, were entirely absent. This mirrored the theatrical tradition, where the audience enjoyed a complete view of the entire performance within the confines of the stage.  As actors typically remained in the middle ground and did not move towards or away from the camera, close-ups were simply not employed.\n\nIn most early trick films, a single conceptual shot corresponded to a complete film. This limitation typically restricted the length of these films to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also constrained the narrative potential of these films, which primarily focused on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearances, and object manipulations, often lacking a substantial storyline.  \n\nIt's important to note, however, that a single \"shot\" in the viewer's perception might not necessarily equal a single physical shot.  To create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, a single \"shot\" could be a compilation of several individual takes spliced together. A close examination of \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals this technique.  Although the film appears as a single continuous shot, a closer inspection unveils the precise moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins.",
            "A figure of prominence in the early days of the Republican movement was John Taylor, hailing from Caroline. Though his primary focus was agriculture, his time in politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering dedication to personal liberty and his outspoken advocacy for limited government. His agrarian worldview served as the foundation for his political beliefs, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw a unique opportunity in the nascent United States to establish an ideal system of governance.  Free from the constraints of established traditions, the nation's founders could construct a system of self-government. He held strong convictions about the inherent rights of individuals, believing them to be interconnected—the denial of one right jeopardized them all, diminishing the value of the remaining freedoms.  These rights, he argued, should be protected from government encroachment.\n\nTaylor believed that what some termed the \"state of nature\"  favored those with physical strength and cunning, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.  \n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent duality of human nature—both good and evil.  He firmly adhered to a dualistic moral framework, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167).  He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and limit the influence of capitalism. He asserted that a government founded on these principles would function equitably regardless of its administrators, who he acknowledged would inevitably be driven by self-interest.\n\nTaylor believed that self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, but it became problematic when it transcended the creation of a society that served the common good and instead fostered sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others. A well-structured government, he argued, was crucial to containing this inherent human tendency toward self-interest, and even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, favoring a limited federal government with powers explicitly enumerated in the document. He recognized that a more expansive federal government could lead to despotism and financial burden. However, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, arguing that without considering the intent of the framers, such an approach could easily be corrupted. He even considered the Declaration of Independence a more definitive charter of the United States, as it more explicitly portrayed the nation as a collection of independent states rather than a unified entity.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This decrease was unexpected and the contributing factors remain somewhat unclear.\n\nThe onset of winter on a New England campus likely influenced the drop, as fewer individuals opt for cycling or walking as transportation methods during colder weather. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity for students and faculty, potentially leading to a decline in log submissions due to competing priorities. Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, a time of heightened festivities and a month-long break for both students and staff, during which campus attendance is considerably reduced. The subsequent resumption of classes in late January may also explain the low log submissions for that month.\n\nHowever, the low submissions in February remain puzzling, suggesting that other factors may be at play. It is conceivable that any new initiative experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline in engagement. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a concentrated campaign designed to revitalize the project. This strategy successfully resulted in an increase in log submissions for that month.\n\nThus, a key challenge encountered was maintaining project momentum despite both the anticipated decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks inherent in the higher education environment.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for this project, and indeed any initiative promoting alternative commuting methods, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving.\n\nTo incentivize the adoption of alternative transportation, we provided a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and a selection of national chain stores. While these incentives proved effective, it would be interesting to explore the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, on participation. Such substantial rewards could have potentially mitigated the dip in engagement observed during the project.\n\nWhile the nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, offering progressively larger incentives over time might have yielded more favorable results. The initial gift cards were sufficient at the project's outset, but announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially stimulated further participation and engagement.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) functions as a type of security designed to mirror the performance of a pre-defined benchmark, such as a stock market index, a commodity, or a collection of assets.  Similar in concept to an index fund, ETFs offer the advantage of diversification while also enabling the flexibility of trading on an exchange, much like individual stocks.  Investors can engage in strategies like short selling, margin buying, and even purchase as little as a single share in any given transaction.  Despite these appealing features, a key advantage of ETFs lies in their typically lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge certain drawbacks.  For instance, trading ETFs incurs a commission fee, similar to buying or selling individual stocks.  Furthermore, while the range of available ETFs is extensive, it's crucial for discerning investors to critically assess the claimed benefits, such as diversification, and determine their actual extent and relevance to individual investment objectives.\n\nThis analysis will focus on a specific ETF, designated IHF, and compare its performance against the top ten holdings that constitute a substantial portion of its assets – approximately 63.58%.  The goal is to evaluate whether the purported advantages of owning a single ETF truly align with the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio comprised of these ten individual stocks.  Additionally, we aim to explore alternative configurations of these stocks that might yield a more favorable risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\n\nTo streamline the evaluation process, we've narrowed our focus to the top ten holdings, as analyzing every single asset within the ETF would be impractical. The specific holdings and their corresponding percentage allocation to the ETF's total assets are detailed below.\n\nTo gauge how effectively these ten stocks represent the overall performance of ETF IHF, we can leverage their existing asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their individual contributions to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return.  This calculation assumes that the portfolio is entirely composed of these ten stocks in the exact proportions held by the ETF. The resulting beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nA notable observation from the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings generates a return 6.11% higher than the ETF IHF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the beta of these ten stocks is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole.  These preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top ten holdings could potentially achieve higher returns with reduced volatility.  However, it's important to acknowledge that these differences in means may not be statistically significant.\n\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of these portfolio performance variations, we'll analyze the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks.  These standard deviations will be normalized to 100% for comparative purposes, allowing us to assess their cumulative impact on volatility in relation to the overall standard deviation of ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finest poetic achievements.  Within this poem, the term \"Thulé\" appears in lines 6 and 56, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by scholar Charles E. Mabbott.  Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island located north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost boundary of their known world. While Virgil's usage is confirmed, another, more contemporary source warrants consideration.  Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature. \n\nA significant element supporting this connection is found in a comparison between Poe's work and that of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a celebrated German author.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" analyzes the similarities between their respective poems, concluding that Poe likely drew inspiration from Goethe's work.  The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts – the first in 1808 and the second, posthumously, in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of this epic poem lies a shorter piece titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem centers on a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet.  Consumed by grief following her passing, he descends into heavy drinking and despair.  Ultimately, he decides to end his life, distributing his possessions to his children, except for the goblet.  He then proceeds to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and takes his own life.  The emotional state and description of the King of Thulé bear a striking resemblance to the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" potentially reflecting Poe's own experiences of loss and his struggle with alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe employs \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works.  While he uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" this term appears twice in \"Dream-Land,\" serving as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces.  In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscapes of Thulé, depicting them as dark and desolate, haunted by the presence of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These themes resonate with those found in \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe, who, following the loss of his wife, experiences loneliness and a waning will to live. The entire poem appears to be a reflection of the speaker stepping into the world created by Goethe.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is undeniable.  Even if Poe admired Tennyson for no other reason, his exposure to Goethe's works would have been extensive due to the numerous reproductions circulating after the original publications.",
            "The question of whether punitive damages are applicable in a situation involving a customer's injury from a slip-and-fall accident due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store, particularly when the store manager allegedly exhibited disregard for the potential harm, is a matter of legal scrutiny.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded in circumstances where a defendant's actions demonstrate \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  To substantiate a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence suggesting the defendant's conduct was characterized by a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result, as well as exhibiting despicable behavior.\n\nThe case of Jennifer Palmer, who sustained injuries from slipping on an applesauce spill, raises the possibility of a successful punitive damage claim. Ms. Palmer's legal argument hinges on the contention that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have been aware of the potential danger posed by the spill, given that prior incidents of slips and falls had occurred at the store. Mr. Martin's alleged inaction, despite being notified about the spill twice, strengthens Ms. Palmer's argument. While the argument that Mr. Martin's actions were \"despicable\" may be less compelling, it remains a reasonable assertion considering the history of similar incidents at the store.\n\nThe timeline of events leading to Ms. Palmer's injury is significant. On October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, independently informed Mr. Martin about the applesauce spill. Mr. Martin, reportedly on a dinner break, dismissed their concerns. Subsequently, at 5:30 pm on the same day, Ms. Palmer slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury.\n\nCalifornia law permits the recovery of punitive damages in situations where a defendant's conduct meets the criteria of \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  Courts have interpreted \"malice\" to encompass actions intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, actions that are \"despicable\" and demonstrate a deliberate disregard for the rights or safety of others.\n\nThe legal team is currently evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim, taking into consideration the specific facts and legal precedents in this case.",
            "During my time at CBC, I enrolled in an introductory course on Islam.  One of the enduring discussions we had centered on the nature of Islam – was it inherently hostile? This question, I believe, holds even greater significance in today's world. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've observed a dramatic shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents, progressing from a stance of hostility and demonization to a seemingly excessive level of acceptance within American society. It's hard to imagine, in the wake of 2001, that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his family's history, could even be considered.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad sparked my curiosity. My prior understanding, gleaned from historical accounts, painted a picture of Muhammad as a forceful figure who coerced tribes into converting to Islam through conquest. However, this biography presented a different perspective – one of a misunderstood martyr, even someone who exhibited humility, drawing individuals to his teachings organically.\n\nCertain parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the accounts of Muhammad's 'miracles' also caught my attention. One example that stands out is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a large group, echoing the biblical accounts of Christ's miracles. This stylistic choice led me to believe the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who didn't need to prove himself but lived authentically, performing miracles as a natural consequence of his connection to truth.  \n\nThis approach, however, felt problematic to me. It seemed to diminish the significance of Jesus' miracles and life, potentially appropriating elements of his story for Muhammad. \n\nFurthermore, the biography frequently relies on accounts relayed through intermediaries – \"so-and-so heard from so-and-so\" – which ultimately raises questions about the reliability of the information.  \n\nWhat ultimately troubled me most was the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue, a gentle, wise, and endearing figure. This portrayal seemed at odds with historical accounts of his rise to power, leading me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the complexities of Muhammad's legacy.",
            "The philosophical and theological teachings attributed to Jesus Christ underwent significant transformations in the wake of his life, diverging from the original tenets he espoused. A historical examination reveals a gradual shift in Christian thought, moving away from its perceived foundations. Contemporary society, characterized by a growing awareness and a progressive ethos, presents a dynamic landscape where traditional perspectives, while persisting, may struggle to exert widespread influence.  \n\nLooking towards the future, a burgeoning historical consciousness within Christianity is anticipated. This will likely fuel a desire to disentangle the doctrines that have accumulated over time from the core message of Jesus. While this process may unfold over decades or even centuries, its trajectory appears inevitable: a resurgence of early Christian principles. A movement, gaining momentum, will progressively shed layers of accumulated doctrines, akin to a rewinding of time, ultimately culminating in a re-emphasis on the essence of Jesus' teachings as understood within his historical context.\n\nThis resurgence, upon reaching the United States and Europe, will likely inspire widespread adherence to a more fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity, mirroring the beliefs and practices of Jesus' era. Despite the emphasis on theological regression, the institutional Church is anticipated to remain a powerful force, guiding this transformation. However, the theological landscape will witness a shift from the current diversity of Christian denominations and beliefs towards greater uniformity.\n\nThroughout history, we observe instances of significant reversals. The conversion of the Roman Empire from persecutor to proponent of Christianity is a notable example. Similarly, the United States has witnessed a transformation from a system of racial enslavement to a leadership role for African Americans. A comparable reversion, driven by a yearning for historical authenticity, is foreseen within the realm of Christianity.\n\nCrucial to this process will be a shift in interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. Examining the historical context of Jesus' teachings reveals that his origin lies within Judaism. By the time Roman rule commenced in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had established itself as a monotheistic religion, with a divinely revealed scripture and a structured hierarchy.  Within this religious landscape, diverse factions emerged, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the broader population of common people.",
            "\"The Jungle,\" by Upton Sinclair, offers a stark portrayal of human nature, suggesting a deep-seated tendency towards greed and self-preservation. The novel vividly illustrates this through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their own wealth and success above all else.  \n\nSinclair masterfully uses imagery to depict the exploitative environment of Packingtown. He describes the factory buildings as \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" with \"great chimneys...streaming away to the end of the world,\" emphasizing the relentless pollution and disregard for the environment. The surrounding area, plagued by \"animal feces and urine runoff,\" further underscores the callous indifference towards the well-being of both people and animals.\n\nThe novel paints a bleak picture of the working conditions endured by factory employees.  Driven by their relentless pursuit of profit, the owners and managers treat their workers as expendable tools.  As Sinclair writes, the workplace is a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  Employees are subjected to grueling hours and the constant threat of sudden layoffs without any compensation or support. \n\nThe lack of legal protections during this era allowed the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to endure hazardous conditions and risking their health and safety. Despite the dire circumstances, there were limited avenues for workers to seek assistance or improve their plight. While unions existed, they were often ineffective, perpetuating a cycle of exploitation.\n\nSinclair's powerful language evokes a sense of desperation and hopelessness, comparing the workers of Packingtown to slaves bound to a brutal system. He argues that with their lives hanging \"on the verge of starvation,\" and subject to the whims of \"brutal and unscrupulous\" masters, the workers were trapped in a situation mirroring the conditions of chattel slavery.",
            "Authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes.  The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of such methods in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" One notable technique involves juxtaposing adjectives and nouns that don't conventionally align, thereby creating a unique aura surrounding a subject. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them for similar effect.  He employs this latter technique extensively with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. \n\nThroughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald constructs layers of meaning around colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to evoke specific feelings associated with pivotal objects.  \n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is that of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class, while gray signifies a sense of age and fading. This association is established early in the novel through frequent uses of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" (8); indeed, everyone appears to be adorned in white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he encounters Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instances where individuals are not wearing white occur when Nick is observing Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40).\n\nFitzgerald further solidifies these color meanings by applying them to commonplace, seemingly insignificant subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's partygoers appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary people or places in terms of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established sufficient meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This utilization of color symbolism to convey meaning begins with Daisy. After an extended period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers consequently perceive Daisy as less of a distinct character and more as a uniform element, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy as a uniform addition through phrases like \"a gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural scene, fueled by its pleasant, sunny weather. Farmers cultivate a variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.  The demand for organic produce from locally sourced Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs is significant in the San Diego region, with numerous organizations experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also popular among consumers. Many organic farms have embraced additional revenue streams by offering tours of their operations, along with recreational activities like hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor pursuits. This type of model allows landowners to potentially benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat, creating recreational opportunities, and establishing avenues for educational programs or income generation. \n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially lucrative niche market, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in the surrounding plant and animal life. This is due to the absence of chemical inputs in the soil and water. However, organic farming does present some financial challenges compared to conventional methods. It often requires more hands-on labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as to fertilize the soil naturally.  Furthermore, losses due to pests and diseases can be higher with organic practices.  Smaller organic farms may also struggle to achieve the same economies of scale as larger operations.  Additional practices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also lead to increased labor costs. These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotation, managing invasive species, and actively shaping plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or patches of open ground.  These factors highlight the reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nOur case study focuses on a 160-acre parcel of land located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  The property is a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, an area covered by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan.  Although still under review, this plan encompasses over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.  Other species, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon face endangered status.\n\nThis area has a long history of human presence, initially inhabited by Native Americans for centuries.  Later, it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s.  This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and/or timber production for many years.\n\nThe selection of this property was based on information gathered from a real estate website.  A thorough examination of available government programs was then conducted to assess the potential options for a small farmer seeking to mitigate costs while implementing wildlife-friendly practices. As a model for potential outcomes, an existing organic farm in the same area was identified and studied.",
            "Cultural nuances significantly influence the dynamics of any negotiation. Culture is a complex tapestry woven from both explicit and implicit threads, defying simplistic categorization. It is neither monolithic nor static, and generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify its multifaceted nature. While acknowledging broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a truly effective negotiator delves deeper, seeking to understand the specific cultural context of the negotiation and its potential impact on the interaction. \n\nWhen encountering a foreign culture, individuals inevitably draw comparisons to their own, leading to both insights and potential pitfalls.  Navigating cultural differences requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical understanding, awareness of cultural biases, and a willingness to embrace cultural diversity. Rather than imposing one's own cultural lens, it is crucial to approach unfamiliar cultures with respect and a genuine desire to understand their values and norms. This is especially vital when entering a negotiation with a weaker bargaining position, as cultural sensitivity can serve as a bridge over potential divides.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to recognize that cultural influences extend beyond national boundaries. Within any given nation, corporations often cultivate their own distinct cultures, shaping employee behavior and interaction. These corporate cultures manifest in various ways, from dress codes and communication styles to hiring practices and charitable initiatives. The spectrum of corporate cultures within a single nation, such as the United States, highlights the diversity of values and perspectives that can coexist within a shared cultural framework.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is paramount, as they provide the underlying motivations and beliefs that guide behavior. For instance, a culture that prioritizes \"saving face\" or communal harmony may discourage public displays of conflict or confrontation, while a culture that emphasizes individual achievement might prioritize a more aggressive negotiation style. Recognizing these underlying values can empower negotiators to tailor their approach and build rapport with counterparts from different cultural backgrounds. While general cultural insights are valuable, building a personal connection with the opposing party can further enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The statement, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. This phrase serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God.  This belief, seemingly shared by another prominent theologian, Thomas Aquinas, forms the foundation for our comparative analysis.  Since both philosophers aim to defend the existence of the same God—specifically, the God described in the Bible—we will proceed on the assumption that both believe in this deity.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison as their arguments are tailored to a specific understanding.  While both Anselm and Aquinas present compelling points, neither, in my view, offers a completely comprehensive rationale for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's examine Anselm's central argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection in comprehending God. He posits that because God exists within our conceptual framework, we cannot truly conceive of his absence. Though his presentation, with its specific terminology, can be somewhat dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that proof of God's existence resides within the realm of our own minds.  Anselm suggests that we needn't rely on external evidence to find truth about God; rather, the existence of this being is inherently true within our own understanding. This reliance on concepts that lack irrefutable empirical evidence is often termed \"faith\" within Christian discourse.\n\nAquinas, however, diverges from Anselm's approach. He argues that the existence of God can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it could potentially attract new adherents without requiring them to accept something unprovable. Instead, they could be convinced through logical reasoning alone. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the existence of God is a logical necessity.  An analogy could be made to a missing puzzle piece: if you have assembled the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can infer the features and existence of the missing piece without having to actually see it.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, later known as Buddha, was born. His life journey led him to renounce worldly possessions and attain enlightenment, ultimately giving rise to Buddhism. The oldest and most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism, which has evolved significantly over its two and a half thousand years of existence.  This evolution is evident in various practices, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation. Both monks and lay followers participate in this ritual, though its origins are not directly linked to Buddha's teachings. These variations extend beyond surface-level customs to encompass the very essence of the religion, influencing both monastic and lay interpretations of Theravada Buddhist doctrine.\n\nThroughout history, the Theravada Buddhist community has navigated both internal and external influences, both positive and negative. To understand these forces, several key terms will be frequently employed. \"Internal\" refers to influences originating from individuals within the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. \"External\" refers to influences stemming from individuals outside of Buddhism. \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to damage or detract from the Buddhist community, often driven by misconceptions or prejudice. Conversely, \"benign\" forces, while not necessarily intending to help or harm, might inadvertently impact the community as a consequence of their actions. These terms will serve as a framework for analyzing the forces shaping Theravada Buddhism.\n\nA fundamental understanding of Theravada Buddhism requires exploring its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\" – the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, the Buddhist scriptures divided into three baskets. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines monastic discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores Buddhist metaphysics. This metaphysical framework includes concepts like Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in existence), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these truths is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and achieving liberation from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living, outlining five precepts for lay followers (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants). Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. Central to Buddhist thought is the Four Noble Truths: 1) Dukkha – life involves suffering; 2) attachment causes suffering; 3) suffering can be overcome; and 4) the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico provides a compelling case study of a prolonged rivalry, lasting from 1836 to 1893.  This period, marked by numerous conflicts, reached its peak with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, resulting in a significant territorial shift in favor of the United States. While numerous clashes occurred throughout this era, tensions finally subsided on the eve of World War I.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry stemmed from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests. This pattern of rivalry between neighboring countries is not unique.  Shared borders often lead to friction and divergent viewpoints, as seen in the enduring tensions between the United States and Mexico.  Historian David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that \"Mexico and Cuba stand out as enduring diplomatic challenges for the United States\" (p. 41), highlighting the persistent nature of these relationships.  Geographically proximate and historically rivals, these nations contrast with others in Latin America who have enjoyed more amicable ties with the United States.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"while Americans in the twentieth century opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  This echoes the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, where ideological differences mingled with competition for strategic advantage.  In the case of the United States and Mexico, the ideological struggle centered around religious preferences, fueled by pre-existing mistrust stemming from the colonial eras.  The legacy of English-Spanish rivalry cast a long shadow on early diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period. The majority of these conflicts revolved around territorial issues, including border incursions and frontier skirmishes.  Banditry and lawlessness along the shared border remained a persistent problem until both nations implemented stricter border security measures (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States economically and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico towards the latter part of the nineteenth century (p. 109, 110).",
            "A life-altering event occurred fifteen years ago, thrusting me into a world of unexpected challenges.  The illness, previously unknown to me, abruptly ended my career as a nurse. While I had chosen nursing for its perceived stability, driven by a childhood yearning for security, my true aspirations lay elsewhere—in the realms of science and journalism.  Despite this, I found myself at forty-six, single, and facing a future without income or the ability to work.\n\nThe reality of disability, a constant companion for fifteen years, has stripped away my financial reserves, leaving me with a profound sense of vulnerability. Social Security Disability benefits provide a bare minimum, each day a struggle for financial stability and emotional well-being.  Uncertainty has become a defining characteristic of my life. \n\nHowever, amidst this adversity, a unwavering truth has emerged: I could not have persevered without the unwavering support of my family and a few steadfast friends.  Their compassion has been a lifeline, a testament to the human capacity for connection and care.\n\nLife is inherently unpredictable, rife with both minor and major upheavals.  While preparedness is essential, certain events transcend individual capabilities, demanding a collective response. \n\nWhile I agree that excessive reliance on government institutions is unwise, I believe fostering a spirit of mutual trust and interdependence is paramount.  Rather than isolating ourselves in self-reliance, we should cultivate a culture of support, where individuals feel empowered to seek and offer assistance.\n\nAmerican history is often romanticized as a story of rugged individualism, but the truth is more nuanced. Our forefathers' resilience stemmed not solely from self-reliance, but from compassion, mutual respect, and a willingness to share resources.  The pioneers who traversed the American West did not conquer the wilderness alone; their success was built on cooperation and community.\n\nTherefore, let us embrace preparedness while simultaneously nurturing a sense of interconnectedness.  I, for one, have taken steps to ensure my safety and well-being, stockpiling essential supplies and learning essential skills.  \n\nBut alongside these practical measures, let us not forget the importance of building strong relationships with our neighbors. Community is our bedrock, a source of strength and support when life inevitably throws curveballs.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the ways they do has long fascinated scientists. Are there inherent limitations or guiding forces that shape the course of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that even the simplest organic forms remained elusive to precise mathematical description,  recent advancements in mathematical modeling offer new perspectives. Researchers have started applying these models to understand the broader aspects of mollusk shell development, both in terms of individual growth (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). This study investigates how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in the genus *Prunum*, alongside experimental research, can shed light on the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes.\n\nUsing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantifiable anatomical parameters. These parameters were then incorporated into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. This allowed us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological variations within *Prunum*. The results of these models are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary trends within this group.\n\nThe structure of a shell can be conceptualized as a tube traversing through a three-dimensional space over time. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella.  The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the base being the opposite end. The aperture is an opening through which the animal extends from its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the observer and the apex points upwards.\n\nCounting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective, identifying the starting point of the first suture, and drawing a line dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are then counted from this line, with estimations made to the nearest quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be interpreted as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By plotting the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with its horizontal and vertical radius, we can trace the path of the aperture. This trajectory can then be represented both visually and mathematically.\n\nOnce a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, allowing us to explore the factors influencing shell development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in neonatal and infant mortality over the last decade has been stagnant. Despite advancements in sectors like water and sanitation, aligning with Millennium Development Goals, child and maternal health improvements fall short of the necessary trajectory to meet the 2015 target.  Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind these shortcomings is crucial, suggesting a stronger emphasis on health system fortification rather than isolated programmatic interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has witnessed a positive shift in the proportion of births attended by skilled health professionals, reaching 72%, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners like midwives who lack the capacity to manage complicated pregnancies. Consequently, a significant portion of maternal deaths are attributed to hemorrhage, highlighting a misleading perception of progress.  Similarly, the decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases among children under five receiving professional treatment warrants concern. Data gaps exist regarding postnatal care, but existing information indicates a nationwide deficiency in this area.\n\nC-section rates remain below expectations at approximately 4%.  Furthermore, the disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) c-section rates underscores an equity issue in healthcare accessibility.  Urban areas appear to dominate access to healthcare services, while a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles points to a vertical equity challenge.  Financial barriers, likely driven by out-of-pocket costs, appear to hinder the poor's access to healthcare.\n\nMoving forward, improving neonatal and maternal care hinges on effectively addressing service gaps.  Should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, particularly pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children?\n\nProgrammatic solutions, while appealing due to their targeted objectives and faster results, present drawbacks.  Concentrating resources on a single health sector often neglects other areas, leading to a potential drain on human resources and funding.  Furthermore, multiple parallel programs risk service duplication and uncoordination, resulting in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its frequent exploration of the aristocratic class. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend, with works like \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" deviating from the established norms. Both novels introduce elements of mystery and the uncanny, characteristics less common in typical Victorian fiction. This distinctive approach strengthens the characters, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\": \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”  \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose of these moments vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, his vulnerabilities, and his perception of the events unfolding around him.  The shooting of Oliver, revisited vividly in chapter 28, serves as a powerful example. He relives the event as if in a dream while desperately seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the situation and his deteriorating physical condition, underscored by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" taking him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, leaving him with a constant, gnawing fear. The question arises: whose will is responsible for Oliver's misfortune? It is clearly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver lacks agency, unable to exert control even in the face of imminent danger. A sense of defeat pervades this experience, suggesting that Fagin's influence has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react.  \n\nAnother example of this dreamlike quality can be found in \"Wuthering Heights\": \n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with elementary students in an after-school program, providing academic support. While I could assist in various subjects, my expertise lay in English and reading.  I was approached by a teacher to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling significantly with reading. He seemed to have unusual difficulties. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were completely foreign to him; it was quite perplexing. \n\nAdrian, who I believe was in third or fourth grade, was of Latino heritage, but spoke English fluently. We faced challenges until I met his mother. While assisting with childcare for a few students who remained behind during a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived.  She communicated solely in Spanish, as her English was limited. My own Spanish skills were rudimentary at the time, but we managed to establish a basic understanding.\n\nThat's when a realization struck me: Adrian wasn't unable to read; he simply lacked a solid grasp of the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this insight ultimately proved beneficial, but I sincerely hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the significant issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It also demonstrates that challenges aren't always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can pose a considerable obstacle. This problem is undeniable, so what can we do to address it?\n\nIn Adrian's case, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring him in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English proficiency, the solutions are far more complex. There isn't a single, definitive answer. \n\nDual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes – none of these approaches alone offer a complete solution. The key lies in a multifaceted approach that incorporates all these elements. \n\nFirst and foremost, dual language programs are a valuable concept, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all students. Studies have shown that children in these programs often outperform their peers academically.\n\nDespite their merits, these programs face resistance, with concerns about resource allocation and the perceived lack of benefit for the majority of students. These fears are unfounded. If we implemented dual language programs more broadly, rather than as an exception, all students would reap the rewards.\n\nBut how do we achieve this?  Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical and unrealistic. However, I strongly believe that we can and should have bilingual support staff, such as tutors or aides, to assist in these programs.",
            "From youth, many of us are instilled with the understanding that there exists something beyond our grasp, something vast and enigmatic. Some seek answers in organized religion, be it Sunday school or temple, while others embark on a journey of introspection. Tradition often guides our beliefs, leading us to embrace the faiths of our parents. However, some reject these tenets entirely, clinging to the conviction that knowledge resides solely within the confines of their own personal experience. Our values may evolve, shifting and transforming over time. Regardless of the path we choose, we strive to define ourselves through our individual perspectives on spirituality, searching for a guiding light to illuminate our way through darkness and into the realm of understanding.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I questioned my father about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the steady drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop to our conversation. Our cigarettes burned between us as we watched water cascade down the gutters, drowning the plants lining the edge of the porch.  He gazed out at the rain, his eyes distant, as if lost in thought, perhaps retracing memories. His physique had become more fragile, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair, once thick, was now thin and sparse. He avoided my gaze, his eyes fixed on the relentless downpour.  A profound sense of isolation washed over me, a fear of confronting the inevitable truth, the reality that I would soon be without him.  To speak of it aloud would only solidify its existence, making it all too tangible.  I held him close, retreated to my chair, and pulled it closer to his, joining him in silent contemplation of the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nMy father's life ended in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, though they prolonged his suffering, failed to alleviate it.  He lingered for months beyond the doctors' predictions, but the value of those extra days remained elusive to me.  \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered to myself in the stillness of the night.  My prayers were absent, as if God had ceased to hear my pleas long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final passage, to see the life that had given birth to me fade away. So I chose not to be present.  I refused to watch the man who had shaped me, whose love had nurtured me, succumb to death.  I yearned to remember him through the vibrant tapestry of his life, not through the bleakness of his demise. I knew him better than anyone else, better even than his own family, and I was certain he wouldn't desire his only child to be a mere observer at his departure. For three days, I retreated into the sanctuary of my bed, a cocoon of grief, waiting for the news.\n\nSilence met my anticipation.  No one called.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt aptly points out in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" presents an intriguing paradox: it's simultaneously old and new.  This literary genre has been subject to a range of critical responses, from dismissals for its perceived lack of depth to celebrations of its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, skillfully blends elements from both ancient and modern romances, forging a novel mode of literary expression. Walpole ingeniously interweaves traditional theatrical elements with a contemporary focus on nature, as he himself describes in his preface (\"A Gothic Story,\" 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily upon medieval gothic theater, architecture, and cultural traditions. \n\nEven in the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, the term \"Gothic\" was already associated with a variety of cultures, styles, and historical periods. It often carried connotations of archaism or cultural primitivism when juxtaposed against the perceived advancements of the modern era. The unique convergence of the theatrical \"Gothic\" style with the novel's emerging format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, has contributed to the enduring appeal of Gothic literature.  It allows the genre to remain both timeless and strikingly contemporary for readers distanced from its origins.\n\nOne of the most prominent themes recurring in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideals of knightly training and conduct are both preserved and reinterpreted in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers because it embodied ideals of courage, honor, and competence—qualities they often saw as lacking in contemporary society, particularly figures like Walpole himself. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and used as a means to critique and potentially improve the present.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have harbored anxieties about the future.  This context may have led him to reflect, perhaps unconsciously, on the perceived moral and inherent goodness of individuals during the \"Gothic\" era, contrasting it with the perceived failings of his own time. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic.  Even before his introduction, the reader is presented with descriptions that highlight his chivalric traits:\n\n[Insert the original description of Frederic here]\n\n\nThe depiction of Frederic is infused with traditional chivalric imagery. He is, first and foremost, a prince who has endured suffering, been deeply affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by enemies. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous knight\" is, of course, heightened, introducing the soon-to-be-canonical Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The intricate network of processes involved in getting products from a customer's order to their doorstep is known as supply chain management.  Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this concept encompasses the comprehensive planning, execution, and oversight of every stage, from raw materials to finished goods, with the ultimate goal of fulfilling customer needs swiftly and efficiently.  Six key elements underpin this complex system: production, supply, inventory management, location optimization, transportation logistics, and information flow. By skillfully managing these elements, businesses strive to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain. It defines the \"who, what, when, and where\" of manufacturing, ensuring alignment with customer demand.  Market analysis plays a crucial role in understanding these demands, guiding decisions about product development and production volume. Once production plans are established, the next step involves determining the optimal location for manufacturing, considering factors like production capacity, quality standards, and proximity to both suppliers and customers.  \n\nFollowing location selection, managers focus on meticulous scheduling and equipment maintenance to ensure smooth and efficient production.  Every detail in this stage is critical, as even minor oversights can lead to significant time and financial losses down the line.  Illustrating this point, my experience working at retail giants like Walmart and Target highlighted the importance of standardized processes. From employee attire to receiving shipments, meticulously documented procedures ensured clarity and consistency, enabling these massive organizations to operate seamlessly.\n\nThe next vital element is supply, encompassing strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.  A company might have multiple production divisions specializing in various aspects of a single product. Managers must carefully allocate production tasks to the most suitable division based on its equipment, workforce, and expertise. \n\nFurthermore, outsourcing specific processes can be a strategic advantage, allowing companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality products flexibly while minimizing costs.",
            "On a bustling city corner, Ellen Page, renowned for her role in the film \"Juno,\" stood alone, a hand-held sign held aloft.  The stark message, scrawled in black marker, declared: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a powerful military junta that seized control in 1962 through a coup.  The year 2007 witnessed a surge in public demonstrations, the first in a decade.  These protests, led primarily by Buddhist monks clad in saffron-colored robes, came to be known as the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government permitted these peaceful gatherings, but tensions escalated rapidly, culminating in what some described as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military.  Monasteries were raided, and foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned. Tragically, Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, lost his life on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a protest. While official reports cite 13 deaths, a defected army colonel, Hla Win, claimed that the true number of casualties was significantly higher, potentially reaching several thousand.\n\nThis pattern of brutality is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have sought to silence dissent and maintain absolute power. Ancient Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, divinely ordained to govern every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors were revered as gods, credited with guiding their people towards prosperity through technological innovation and the ritual of seppuku.  Even contemporary political figures, such as former U.S. President George W. Bush, have been associated with controversial figures and organizations.\n\nHistory provides numerous stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where intellectuals, activists, and students gathered to demand democratic reforms, resulted in a violent crackdown. The official death toll remains disputed, with estimates ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s witnessed the systematic extermination of Tutsis and political moderates by Hutu militias, backed by the government.  And the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany during World War II, stands as a horrifying testament to the consequences of racial hatred and intolerance.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz landscape is largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his keen ability to mold his orchestra. While his piano presence often takes a subtle role in the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his creation of intricate and multifaceted pieces that allowed his band members to showcase their individual talents. He meticulously constructed frameworks that encouraged improvisation while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and phrases tailored to the unique styles of each musician, thereby highlighting specific musical ideas. This approach also served to shape the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in coherent and distinctive sonic textures that complemented each composition. Ellington's masterful grasp of both the individual players' sounds and their collective synergy enabled him to produce some of the most innovative and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sonic innovations, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his lifelong practice of utilizing voice \"as a jazz instrument.\" This early composition demonstrates Ellington's ability to incorporate voice as a textural and timbral element without relying on conventional lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also exemplifies his talent for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues structure unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between voice and reeds, where the vocal line commences smoothly and melodically, gradually transitioning to a more rugged sound towards its conclusion.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that embellishes the basic melody while emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. This time, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, taking on a more instrumental role as a soloist.\n\nTag: A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, unconventional ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice to enhance the tonal color of this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that permeates his entire oeuvre. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly blends his mastery of tight orchestration with his keen ear for tonal nuance. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice, creating a rich and harmonious sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further extends these ideas, as Ellington brilliantly utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "A persistent yearning had always resided within her. This unexplainable need, a void begging to be filled, first emerged during her adolescence, at the tender age of fourteen. Three years later, at seventeen, the longing persisted.  While she had begun to realize she craved connection, specifically with a person rather than a material object, no one captured her interest. Despite the advances of several boys, who awkwardly attempted to woo her with little success, she remained unaffected. This peculiarity led to much introspection, causing her to ponder the reasons behind her lack of romantic inclination. Years of contemplation had yielded various theories, but none that truly satisfied her search for an explanation.  \n\nLife unfolded, punctuated by her persistent questioning of desires that seemed to defy societal norms. \n\nHer daily existence was typically serene.  Her parents, individuals of remarkable tranquility, rarely engaged in conflict, and disagreements with their daughter were equally uncommon. Their sole point of contention was her assertion of independence and her vibrant personality, which, while charming and endearing, sometimes clashed with their more subdued natures.\n\nHowever, today's tranquility was shattered. As she moved through the house in search of inspiration, a sharp cry echoed from the kitchen, her mother's voice laced with pain.  Panic surged within her as she rushed to the source of the sound, her voice trembling with concern, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" \n\nThere she found her mother lying on the floor, visibly distressed, her words punctuated by gasps of pain.  Rushing to her side, her daughter offered comfort. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were strained and whispered, revealing the intensity of her suffering.\n\n\"Okay, Mom,\" she replied, her voice firm despite her own rising anxiety. \"Just tell me where to pick you up.\" Following her mother's instructions, she swiftly carried her to the car, carefully laying her in the back seat.  \n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital mingled with the undercurrent of fear, but her focus remained solely on her mother's well-being.  She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical assistance as she went.  Concerned faces gathered around, and a rolling bed was quickly brought to her mother's side. They whisked her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to wait, consumed by worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the connection between following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\"  and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a tailored version of the Med diet, characterized by a focus on plant-based foods, including protein sources like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while excluding potatoes. It emphasizes monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and includes fish, with reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted within this dietary pattern.\n\nPrevious studies had shown a link between adherence to a Med diet and a decreased risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. In fact, a trial found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels (specifically, lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). However, these prior studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states.  Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each woman six times, using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess their dietary intake from the previous year.  Remarkably, over 95% of the nurses remained involved in the study throughout this entire 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies to ensure their accuracy.  Information about CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke cases was confirmed through review of medical records, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, though this applied to about 17% of all stroke cases and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.  For each FFQ, researchers calculated body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Starting in 1986, they also assessed leisure-time physical activity.\n\nTo minimize random variation for each individual and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary habits, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. These averages combined scores from the two preceding years. To account for potential confounding factors (variables that could influence the results), adjustments were made for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. Separate models were used to analyze fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe findings revealed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a greater aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of developing both CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a significant downturn for the United States economy, characterized by a severe financial crisis.  Unemployment rates climbed, the housing market experienced a substantial decline, and numerous prominent corporations faced substantial challenges. This economic instability has persisted, prompting a critical examination of its origins and potential solutions.  \n\nA key contributing factor to this crisis was a combination of political decisions and insufficient oversight within the financial sector.  Pressure exerted on banks and lending institutions led to the widespread issuance of sub-prime loans, further exacerbated by an immature and inadequately regulated financial infrastructure. \n\nSimultaneously, government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were encouraged to package these mortgages into complex financial instruments known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, the financial system experienced a ripple effect, as banks faced depleted capital reserves and transferred the resulting losses onto these repackaged mortgages and, consequently, the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the late 1990s, during President Clinton's second term. In an effort to secure re-election, the administration implemented policies aimed at expanding homeownership, including relaxing lending standards. This move, while seemingly beneficial at the time, ultimately created a foundation for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded years later.  Journalists and analysts, such as Steven Holmes of the New York Times, raised concerns about the potential consequences of these relaxed regulations, predicting a scenario similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nThe complexity of modern mortgage products, including adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs, further contributed to the crisis. These intricate financial instruments interconnected various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial institutions.  \n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.  Major investment banks, collectively holding an estimated $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, faced severe consequences. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at discounted prices, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to restructure as commercial banks under stricter regulatory oversight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with approximately $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, that stage in a narrative where authors attempt to convey backstory and world-building, can be a double-edged sword. While it offers the chance to paint a vivid picture for the reader, it also walks a tightrope between enriching the story and overwhelming it with unnecessary information.  \n\nExperienced writers understand the importance of \"showing, not telling,\" yet even they can sometimes fall prey to lengthy exposition dumps. These moments, where narrative momentum stalls and information feels forced, can leave readers disengaged and longing for the story to progress. \n\nThink of exposition as a bridge between the known and the unknown. It sets the scene, introduces characters, and establishes the context for the unfolding events. However, this bridge should be traversed efficiently and organically, seamlessly woven into the narrative fabric.\n\nConsider a scenario where a story informs the reader about a central character's past love and subsequent tragedy.  Instead of simply stating that the heroine met her beloved, married them, and then witnessed their untimely demise, a skilled writer would delve deeper. They would reveal the depth of their love through dialogue, interactions, and subtle details that showcase their bond. \n\nFor instance, we might see glimpses of the husband's devotion in his actions, his words, and his mannerisms.  Similarly, the heroine's character could be illuminated through her reactions to him, her memories, and her reflections on their shared experiences.  This approach not only provides a richer understanding of the characters but also creates an emotional connection with the reader, making their grief and loss more poignant.\n\nUltimately, the goal of exposition is to inform and engage without interrupting the flow of the story. It's about providing the necessary context while allowing the narrative to breathe and evolve organically.",
            "I observed two news broadcasts originating from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. My first viewing was of NBC 4's live morning broadcast. The lead story focused on a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot displayed. The report, lasting approximately two minutes, indicated multiple stab wounds and his subsequent arrest. The brevity seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe subsequent segment addressed the early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Critically injured, he remained unidentified by authorities at the time. The SWAT Team was engaged in the investigation. This story felt comparatively brief, leading me to speculate whether the brevity stemmed from the victim's race or the location of the incident. A recurring observation of mine is the underrepresentation of minority victims in media coverage. It appears that cases involving white victims often receive significantly more attention, be it kidnappings, disappearances, or other crimes. \n\nFurther coverage included a report on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The incident site and the determination of a .22 caliber rifle being the source of the projectile were detailed. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension.\n\nA brief segment followed, focusing on the anticipated rain and thunderstorms for the upcoming weekend, with temperatures predicted to remain in the mid-to-low eighties. This seemingly concise report served as a \"teaser\" to encourage viewer engagement. \n\nAnother story involved a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I noted an emphasis on the suspect's race and complexion, which seemed disproportionate to the narrative.\n\nFinally, the broadcast covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, sentenced to 300 months for conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. The unusual phrasing of his sentence, instead of stating the typical 25 years, struck me as peculiar. The mention of Rodriguez's Hispanic ethnicity also seemed tangential to the core story.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, an unyielding and everlasting tie. Within this bond reside a multitude of emotions: affection, admiration, envy, and even ruthlessness, to name a few. Brothers possess an understanding that transcends ordinary relationships, a profound insight into one another's souls. In their reflections, they see not just an image, but a mirror reflecting their truest selves. When faced with adversity, the essence of this bond is revealed, manifesting either in acts of extraordinary compassion or unspeakable darkness. These emotions, when laid bare, carry a weighty consequence.  Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal link necessitates confronting the repercussions they inevitably bring. When one can gaze into a brother's eyes and perceive their own reflection staring back, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they truly are. The essence of their character lies not in their intentions, but in the actions they take and the consequences that follow. In the narrative \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a journey exploring this intricate theme, delving into the tempestuous emotions that accompany it.  \n\nSet against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered landscapes, these two young boys set off on a journey destined for futility.  A palpable clash of bitter disappointment and fervent pride erupts in the narrative's climax, leaving only one brother to emerge from the ordeal alive. This central theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which illuminates the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world around him—influences that profoundly shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be distilled to a singular, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial forays together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors a sense of resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother with whom he could share his worldly knowledge, someone who could keep pace with him in activities such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desired a companion who could join him in adventures like \"racing to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\"  These aspirations, however, are dashed against the reality of Doodle's condition.  Born with a frail heart, Doodle's survival was precarious, and participation in vigorous physical activity seemed an impossibility. For the young protagonist, whose mind brimmed with boundless energy and imagination, this realization was a devastating blow. His dreams were shattered, leaving him consumed by disappointment.  Indeed, his resentment towards the younger child manifests in a chilling thought: contemplating infanticide by smothering him with a pillow. Such a thought, born of frustration and despair, speaks volumes about the protagonist's internal struggles. Yet, a glimmer of his innate love for his brother surfaces when the child offers a simple smile. This small gesture instills a flicker of hope in the protagonist's heart, suggesting that his dark inclination was perhaps not as deeply rooted as he initially believed.",
            "The intricate workings of the human brain, a marvel of biological engineering, have long fascinated thinkers and scientists alike. As our understanding of this complex system has evolved, so too have the analogies used to describe its functions. From ancient comparisons to the malleability of wax tablets to the structured organization of papyrus scrolls, and later to the computational power of modern computers, each metaphor sheds light on certain aspects of the brain's workings while ultimately falling short of capturing its full complexity.\n\nThe process of information acquisition begins with sensory input, where specialized receptors translate external stimuli, such as tactile sensations, temperature variations, sound waves, or light particles, into electrochemical signals. These signals then undergo a series of transformations within the intricate neural networks of the brain, guided by both bottom-up and top-down processing mechanisms. Consider, for instance, the perception of a simple image: a black square against a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes individual elements, such as color, shape, and spatial relationships, gradually assembling these pieces into a coherent whole – the recognition of a square. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages existing knowledge and expectations to expedite this recognition, allowing us to swiftly identify the object as a square rather than, say, a void within the white space.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an intricate attentional filter comes into play, selectively prioritizing certain signals based on their perceived significance. This filter, akin to a gatekeeper, ensures that our cognitive resources are allocated efficiently. For example, while our visual system may register every blade of grass beneath our feet, our attentional filter prevents us from consciously perceiving each individual blade, allowing us to focus on more salient stimuli. Conversely, our name, even amidst a cacophony of sounds, will readily capture our attention. This interplay between processing stages and attentional modulation is a fundamental aspect of how the brain orchestrates our perception and understanding of the world.\n\nTo effectively process information, the brain relies on sophisticated memory systems. These systems, which include sensory, working, and long-term memory, enable us to encode, store, and retrieve information over varying durations. Encoding, the initial stage of information storage, involves transforming sensory input into a format that can be stored in the brain. Different types of sensory stimuli may be encoded in distinct ways. For instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (based on the visual appearance of the word), phonemically (based on its sound), or semantically (based on its meaning). Once encoded, information is maintained within different memory stores. Working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, is thought to be maintained through a continuous loop of electrical signals circulating through specific neuronal pathways. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be encoded within the intricate structures of proteins.\n\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Several models have been proposed, drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model, the semantic network model, posits that concepts are represented as nodes, and these nodes are interconnected based on their semantic relationships. For example, the concept of \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" creating a network of interconnected ideas.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" presents a chilling vision of a future where technological advancement and a rigid capitalist system intertwine to create a dystopian society. In this world, the emphasis on communal harmony overshadows individual expression, and citizens are meticulously conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else.  They exist as cogs in a vast machinery, their thoughts and actions meticulously controlled by the World Controller, who enforces a singular, unquestioned ideology.  Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's profound unease regarding the trajectory of these very systems.\n\nTerms like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist theory, resonate throughout the novel, suggesting that Huxley viewed the burgeoning economic landscape of his time with both fascination and trepidation. He satirizes capitalism through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class, preoccupied with their own immediate needs, remains blind to the true power dynamics at play. This ideological manipulation, reminiscent of the control exerted over the proletariat in Marxist thought, is evident in the conditioning of the World State's citizens. The lower castes, designated as Delta, Gamma, and others, lack independent volition. Their desires are relentlessly shaped through \"hypnopædia,\" a form of sleep-learning,  to fuel a relentless cycle of consumption and spending. This manipulation, orchestrated by the World Controller, highlights the insidious nature of hegemony, a system where a dominant group exerts control over subordinate classes. The lower castes remain blissfully unaware of this manipulation, unwittingly perpetuating the very system that keeps them subjugated. While the upper classes, such as the Alphas and Betas, possess the capacity for awareness, they largely remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions without question.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in \"Brave New World\" are strangely sterile, lacking the depth and complexity that mark genuine human connection. Their interactions are superficial, often reduced to superficial observations about physical appearance or fleeting encounters. This absence of genuine emotional bonds underscores Huxley's chilling suggestion that the relentless march of technology and unchecked capitalism may ultimately strip humanity of its capacity for love, empathy, and meaningful expression. The characters themselves seem interchangeable, further emphasizing the dehumanizing effects of this engineered society.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned approximately two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus, a challenge faced by many, including myself, has been a recurring topic of discussion. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the sprawling campus, excluding, of course, the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my residence to classes held in distant locations like Willard building, closer to the heart of campus, frequently involved a trek of up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when inclement weather – a frequent occurrence in State College – presented obstacles. Through conversations with an alum, not significantly older than myself, I learned that the East Halls dormitories were once isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of undeveloped land. Today, this once-vacant space has undergone a remarkable transformation, now accommodating sports fields, substantial new constructions such as the modern Creamery and the recently erected health services building, and a ring of residential apartments. As our campus continues to expand, the task of traversing this increasingly complex landscape becomes progressively more demanding.\n\nA pressing question arises: what constitutes the most effective solution to this mobility challenge? For a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a strong contender. However, the bicycle alone cannot provide a complete answer. Student adoption is crucial, and the campus infrastructure must be thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of cyclists.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had reintroduced cycling into their life after a multi-year hiatus revealed their astonishment at ever having abandoned this mode of transportation. \"Bikes are truly exceptional,\" they remarked, \"during a period when cycling wasn't considered fashionable, it remained the most practical means of getting around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling boasts remarkable efficiency. A modest breakfast of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel you for 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, located a comparable distance from the campus center as certain dormitories.  The most astute decision I have made this year was the acquisition of a bicycle. Daily, I attend classes in Thomas building, a location easily a 25-minute walk from my residence. Cycling can significantly reduce this travel time to a mere 5 minutes, provided a brisk pace is maintained.\n\nUnfortunately, Pollock Road, the most direct route from my home to Thomas building, presents challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists. While walking offers its merits, my current schedule leaves little room for extended walks. In the absence of my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable option for reaching classes. A daily trek to Thomas on foot would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours each week. Accounting for the time required to walk to and from other classes, appointments, and various other commitments, this additional walking time would be unsustainable."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aspiration to pursue social work stems from a deep-seated desire to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicating my efforts to supporting children who have endured abuse or neglect and providing crucial assistance to families facing challenges.  The core values that I believe I can contribute to this field are service, respect, ethical conduct, and a steadfast commitment to fostering improved relationships both within families and within the broader community.  Moreover, I am dedicated to continuous professional development, ensuring I remain well-equipped and knowledgeable in my chosen field.  These values are not merely professional ideals; they are deeply ingrained in my personal philosophy.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have always felt a strong call to assist others, though my specific path remained unclear. Observing individuals grappling with difficulties, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, fueled my desire to make a meaningful difference. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and its complexities.  Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took some time to reflect and explore different avenues.\n\nOne summer day, a chance encounter with a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. This experience profoundly impacted me, prompting me to reach out to the boy's parents in an attempt to offer support and advocate for his well-being. While legal intervention was not immediately possible, my conversation with the parents revealed their own struggles and a reluctance to acknowledge the severity of the situation. This encounter solidified my conviction to pursue a career in social work, where I could directly address the needs of vulnerable children and families facing similar challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value I hold dear and believe is essential to the field of social work.  As a society, we often celebrate individuality while simultaneously adhering to rigid societal norms and expectations. This paradox highlights the need to challenge these norms and advocate for genuine equality and inclusivity. Throughout my academic years, I actively engaged in various forms of activism, expressing my commitment to social justice through my personal style, my involvement with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance (GSBA), and my unwavering stance against racism and discrimination. I believe in fighting for a more equitable and just society and will continue to use my voice and actions to promote these values.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological model centers on genetic predispositions and physiological factors influencing sleep. In contrast, sociocultural models explore the interplay between environmental influences and aspects such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographic background. This review will analyze research relevant to both models, elucidating each study's findings and critically evaluating its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders stemming from medical or substance-related factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias involve difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, and sleepwalking disorder. Sleep disorders linked to mental health can arise from either Axis I disorders (clinical disorders) or Axis II disorders (personality disorders or intellectual disabilities). This review will primarily focus on insomnia and, to a lesser extent, primary sleep disorders, analyzing them through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genes, inherited traits, and physiological mechanisms.  Neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, particularly the orexin-producing neurons, plays a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles.  Research utilizing animal models, such as mice, has revealed phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that are implicated in sleep-wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Studies have shown that GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that findings from animal models may be applicable to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Variations or malfunctions in this receptor could potentially disrupt sleep patterns, potentially requiring medication for adequate rest. From a sociocultural perspective, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence an individual's sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could naturally predispose them to sleep difficulties. This could have a profound impact on various aspects of life, including academic performance, professional success, and daily activities requiring sustained attention and focus.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  It begins with a concise definition of the disorder. Next, it delves into the diagnostic process, outlining common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the paper concludes with practical strategies that classroom teachers in inclusive settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD),  describes the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  More specifically, (C)APD refers to the brain's processing of sound information and the neurological activity underlying this processing, leading to specific electrical responses in the auditory system (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Essentially, CAPD is a condition where the brain struggles to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD typically have normal hearing; they can perceive sounds, but the part of the brain responsible for translating those sounds, distinguishing words, and separating speech from background noise, functions differently than usual.\n\nEarly recognition of what would become known as CAPD emerged in the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Researchers examining children with communication difficulties began exploring this concept.   In 1954, an Italian research team, including Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, started developing assessments for these children.  Building on this, Kimura, in 1961, introduced \"dichotic testing\" and proposed a model explaining the physiology of the CNS involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A significant national conference in 1977 spurred further research focused on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways.  Some individuals may have difficulty locating or perceiving sounds in space, distinguishing between two or more sounds, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech (such as recognizing sarcasm based on changes in tone). They might struggle to filter out background noise, synthesize auditory cues (interpreting sounds meaningfully), or determine the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive process that includes observing listening behaviors and evaluating auditory function through a range of tests conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other qualified professionals (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These evaluations may incorporate questionnaires, surveys, observations of auditory behaviors, and responses to specific auditory stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted test for diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many assessments present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and require them to differentiate specific elements, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the intricate consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a tool for deception, ultimately, individuals must confront their true selves to avoid losing their identity. However, the act of revealing the truth can lead to social isolation.  One must then grapple with a difficult choice: preserving one's authentic self or maintaining relationships with those around them.  Though some may react neutrally to being deceived, others might be deeply hurt and offended by the charade. \n\nThe play delves particularly into the complexities of deception when it involves gender role reversal. A crucial question arises: why do characters choose to adopt a different gender identity? In Viola's case, her decision stems from a need for protection. Arriving in a foreign land, she adopts the guise of a man to safeguard herself from potential harm: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nWhile this strategy proves effective, it simultaneously distances Viola from the female community, severing a vital support system. Ironically, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian, resulting in romantic entanglement: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Moreover, Viola grapples with suppressed feelings for Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nAlthough this dynamic might appear progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on how deception may inadvertently expose hidden emotions. Olivia and Orsino's reactions to Viola/Cesario suggest repressed desires that are brought to the surface. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario rooted in his perceived masculinity, or does it hint at a deeper, perhaps subconscious, inclination towards women?  It's plausible that Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia satirizes the superficial judgments prevalent in his era, as evidenced by her swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her eventual acceptance of Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "The impact of German colonialism on various regions has been widely studied, with particular emphasis on the tragic events surrounding the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa. However, it is crucial to recognize that such a vast and complex empire as Germany's colonial holdings cannot be solely defined by this singular act of brutality. The German colonial experience was characterized by a diverse range of policies and administrative approaches, mirroring the varied geographical landscapes it encompassed.\n\nEducational initiatives across the colonies also exhibited significant variations.  When the British assumed control of German East Africa (later known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable population of educated and literate Africans.  Similarly, German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary scholars.\n\nIn stark contrast to this scenario, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a drastically different picture.  Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government actively established state schools and played a central role in the education of indigenous populations, South West Africa saw native education largely entrusted to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  However, the German administration did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing more substantial funding and oversight to missionary institutions. The ramifications of these divergent educational policies persisted long after the termination of German rule. While other German colonies boasted a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, a vast majority of the population remained unschooled and illiterate.\n\nA confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark contrast in educational outcomes. This study aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing particularly on recent research that sheds light on the attitudes and perspectives of colonial settlers and authorities towards African natives.\n\n\nExisting scholarship on education within the German colonial empire is extensive. A significant portion of these sources are in German and were produced during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary objective of earlier works was to document the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific educational facets. These investigations highlighted significant disparities in the educational structures of different colonies.\n\nA seminal work that directly addresses the theme of this paper is Cohen's study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen juxtaposes the educational systems of these two colonies, exploring the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining many of the unique characteristics of the colony's educational system.\n\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to other German colonies, enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although arid desert regions spanned much of the territory. The European population of South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past century has resulted in a vast and ever-expanding array of genres, making a definitive catalog nearly impossible. This complexity is further amplified by the proliferation of subgenres within each established category – think rock, country, jazz, folk, rap, and countless others.\n\nAmong these, Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most dynamic and expressive genres in the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its capacity to explore a wide spectrum of emotions, often gravitating towards the darker and more intense. This genre's diversity is equally noteworthy, as its early iterations quickly revealed a remarkable malleability, prompting artists to carve out unique subgenres, which in turn spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, creating a constantly evolving landscape.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is characterized by a dizzying array of niches, making it challenging to pinpoint a singular definition of what constitutes \"heavy metal.\"  Despite its diverse influences, the genre undeniably has roots in a specific historical context. To fully comprehend the multifaceted nature of Metal music prevalent today, one must first delve into the origins of the Metal movement itself, understanding its unique trajectory beyond the confines of a mere musical genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is, in many ways, a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It can be perceived as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatrical elements.  It challenges primitivism, prioritizing technical proficiency and skilled musicianship, evident in the intricate compositions and performances of Metal artists.\n\nFurthermore, Metal is undeniably intertwined with the influence of psychedelic drugs. The mid-1970s witnessed a surge in drug use, fueling a creative explosion that resulted in unconventional and boundary-pushing music.  Drugs, in many cases, served as both inspiration and a scapegoat for these sonic explorations.\n\nMetal's dark and visceral qualities were a stark departure from the prevailing trends in popular music at the time, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the human experience. Later generations of Metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's exploration of darkness and emotional intensity, echoing those themes in their own music.\n\nLyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this inherent darkness:\n\n\nThese lyrics, often cited as a harbinger of Heavy Metal, reveal a darker side to the band, characterized by a volatile emotional landscape, potentially influenced by drug use. Considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Heavy Metal, it emerged as a response to the Rolling Stones' own foray into heavier, darker territory.  The Beatles sought to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity, ultimately including \"Helter Skelter\" on their groundbreaking album, The White Album.",
            "Many years before Surrealism emerged with its dreamlike canvases, a painter named Henri Rousseau was diligently crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" transcends the image of a woman awestruck by the wonders of her slumbering world. It also serves as a reflection of Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the outset of his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art community. Yet, he faced a profound internal conflict: should he conform to prevailing artistic trends to gain approval from the critical world he deeply admired, or should he embrace his own unique vision, forging an independent path?  \n\n\"The Dream\" stands as the culmination of this lifelong struggle within Rousseau's artistic soul. To truly grasp its essence, one must delve into the artist's life story.  Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau's early life was far removed from the world of art. His father, a prosperous businessman, offered no formal artistic training. Instead, Rousseau worked for the French government as a toll collector until the age of forty. Despite this unconventional background, a profound personal tragedy – the loss of his wife and eight young children – compelled him to seek solace in painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau, a true folk artist, captured the hopes and dreams of ordinary people.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance within the art world is understandable when viewed through the lens of his circumstances.  His late start in art, coupled with his lack of formal training, placed him at a disadvantage amidst a generation of talented and celebrated artists.  Even as his artistic career progressed, recognition eluded him until around the same time that Henri Matisse began to establish himself as a leading figure in the art world. Author Jan Gordon, in her book \"Modern French Painters,\" illuminates the stark contrast between the two artists. While both competed for recognition, Gordon argues that their motivations and approaches were fundamentally different: Matisse, driven by a fear of producing commonplace art, and Rousseau, who longed to create works so conventional that they would grant him entry into the prestigious “Artiste Français.”",
            "Throughout history, numerous thinkers have explored the intriguing relationship between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental connection between truth and beauty. This belief resonates deeply with me, echoing the sentiment expressed by John Keats in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge stems from formal education or personal experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics appears to be more intuitive. As Keats implies, these concepts seem to be grasped instinctively rather than through conventional learning. \n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics, in essence, strive to describe rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty primarily aim to elucidate the reasons behind the captivating nature of a work of art or literature, or the ethical implications of certain actions. These pursuits are less about establishing rigid rules for artistic creation or moral conduct and more about illuminating the underlying principles that govern these realms.\n\nFurthermore, critical analysis of art or morals often falls short of fully capturing their essence.  For instance, dissecting the merits of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might involve examining elements like composition, lighting, or historical context, yet these factors alone fail to fully explain its artistic merit. When asked about a cherished piece of art or literature, we frequently find ourselves uttering phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" before delving into more elaborate explanations. This suggests that art and morals possess an intangible quality that transcends mere description.  \n\nSimilar to Flannery O'Connor's assertion that \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\"  literature and art possess an inherent depth that defies complete articulation. No matter how meticulously we analyze their elements, a certain ineffable quality remains. I believe ethics shares this same characteristic. As Wittgenstein states, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" This elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, arguably constitutes the most compelling aspect of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that establishes a profound connection between them.\n\nThe profound link between morality and art stems from our deeply personal and experiential engagement with both. They resonate with us on a level that transcends mere intellectual comprehension. This connection is particularly evident in literature.  As McKean aptly observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its distinct culture woven through its diverse landscapes. From the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel, a shared cultural identity prevails. This cultural tapestry can be traced along the Rhine River, passing through Cologne and reaching the historic Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this rich cultural heritage, it's not surprising that contemporary Germany emerged from a confluence of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people is known as Germania. The origins of the name remain a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a renowned Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before their westward migration and subsequent conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often engaging in skirmishes (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Caesar's use of the term may have originated from the Gauls themselves, who employed it to distinguish their enemies. In the opening chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories suggest the name \"Germania\" might relate to the spear, known as a \"ger,\" used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly derive from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying a boisterous or noisy nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" Tacitus, the Roman historian, described the origins of the German people.  He argued that the Germans were an indigenous population, distinct from other races and unmixed through migration or intermingling.  He wrote: \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\n\nDuring the first century AD, Germanic tribes resided along the fringes of the Roman Empire. They traded goods obtained from their lands and contributed to the Roman army, offering their skills as soldiers (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).  While Romans ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely remained within the confines of their vast empire.",
            "The scene below held me captive, my mind absorbing the details without truly processing them. It was a detached observation, a practiced gaze that analyzed without engaging. Thoughts flickered in and out of awareness, fleeting and ephemeral. My consciousness moved with such fluidity, it felt as though I were merely experiencing, rather than thinking.\n\nI had once attempted to learn to draw, inspired by an artist I knew. I picked up a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" hoping to unlock the secrets of artistic expression. It covered everything from the fundamentals of drawing to the intricate workings of the brain's visual perception. One technique it emphasized was the use of a frame, a way of simplifying complex images. Imagine a bustling kitchen scene, a bowl of fruit on a table, and with a mental frame, you isolate just the fruit, transforming the overwhelming into the manageable.\n\nBut at that moment, staring down at the bowl before me, I couldn't summon that mental frame. I was overwhelmed, awestruck.  Artists like Picasso and Monet, masters of color and form, had their signature styles. If I dared to dream of artistic expression, this was where it would begin, my own unique story unfolding.\n\nMy hand hovered over the object of my artistic endeavor, muscles tensed and released as I moved. My mind's intent took shape in a moment that felt charged with creative possibility. Water swirled, a serene and flawless expanse, crystal clear and pure. Particles detached from the whole and vanished into nothingness.  \n\nMuscles tightened, spasmed, and jerked with a growing unease. My hand struck the toilet handle again, a forceful thrust.  The stubborn brown mass resisted, clinging stubbornly to the porcelain.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie a constricting band around my neck, I frowned. My gaze fell on the unwelcome offering left behind, a reminder of the unsavory reality of cleaning bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper, mummifying itself like an oven mitt. Rising to my feet, then bending at the waist, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a slow, deliberate movement, like a mother venturing into a hot oven.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage fatalities on the road demands our immediate attention.  Several contributing factors converge to create a dangerous situation for young drivers. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health highlights the developmental immaturity of the adolescent brain, which is not fully equipped to handle the complexities and risks associated with driving.  In addition to this biological factor, the undeniable reality of inexperience plays a crucial role. This lack of experience not only elevates the likelihood of fatal accidents but also increases the incidence of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly exacerbates the risks faced by young drivers.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center established a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents involving teen drivers.\n\nRecognizing this urgent need for intervention, several states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses designed to mitigate these dangers. These licenses impose restrictions on driving hours and prohibit younger passengers.  \n\nHowever, while these measures offer a temporary solution, they fail to address the fundamental issue: the inherent vulnerability of young drivers.  Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, a respected psychologist, argues that even the age of 18 is too young to grant unrestricted driving privileges. His research suggests a persistent inclination towards risk-taking among individuals under the age of 20, fueled by a desire for thrill-seeking.  \n\nDelaying the acquisition of a full driver's license until this tendency towards risk-taking diminishes would be a prudent step towards reducing the alarming number of teen driver fatalities.  The looming arrival of a new wave of young drivers, the children of the Baby Boomer generation, presents a significant challenge. By 2010, millions of these teenagers will be eligible to drive, potentially leading to a catastrophic surge in accidents unless we take decisive action.\n\nA comprehensive legislative solution is clearly warranted.  Driver's education could continue to be provided in schools as a foundational step in the learning process.  However, the minimum driving age should be raised to 18, with provisional permits issued prior to granting full driver's licenses.  Practical driving training hours would remain a requirement, building upon the existing standards set by most states.  California, for example, currently mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nUniform, nationwide legislation on this issue would be a logical and effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country.\n\nThe proposal outlined here is not a radical departure from existing practices.",
            "A closer examination of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films revealed a fascinating set of fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901.  These short films primarily relied on clever editing techniques to create captivating illusions. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the stylistic conventions employed in the majority of these trick films, as well as identifying any unique or innovative characteristics present in a few of the later productions. \n\nThe typical trick film of this era adhered to a distinct visual language.  Often set within a confined indoor space framed by a frontal proscenium, these films featured minimal camera movement, relying on long and medium shots.  A significant characteristic was the adherence to a strict principle where a single conceptual shot corresponded to a complete film.  However, a few pioneering works at the dawn of the twentieth century challenged these established norms by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne recurring visual element shared by these trick films is the setting within an interior, enclosed by the boundaries of a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary within this proscenium, refraining from following figures or objects as they moved. This compositional style, common in early cinema, drew inspiration from the theater and, specifically, vaudeville and magic performances. This stage-bound approach, however, imposed limitations on the movement of characters within the films.  They generally moved side-to-side, confined to a horizontal axis and never advancing towards or receding from the camera.  Consider, for example, the action in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side and perform their actions along this horizontal plane, even exiting the frame without the camera pursuing them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also influenced the choice of shot types.  Long shots and, less frequently, medium shots predominated in these films.  Close-ups, a technique that would become commonplace in later filmmaking, were entirely absent. This mirrored the theatrical tradition, where the audience enjoyed a complete view of the entire performance within the confines of the stage.  As actors typically remained in the middle ground and did not move towards or away from the camera, close-ups were simply not employed.\n\nIn most early trick films, a single conceptual shot corresponded to a complete film. This limitation typically restricted the length of these films to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also constrained the narrative potential of these films, which primarily focused on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearances, and object manipulations, often lacking a substantial storyline.  \n\nIt's important to note, however, that a single \"shot\" in the viewer's perception might not necessarily equal a single physical shot.  To create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, a single \"shot\" could be a compilation of several individual takes spliced together. A close examination of \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals this technique.  Although the film appears as a single continuous shot, a closer inspection unveils the precise moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins.",
            "A figure of prominence in the early days of the Republican movement was John Taylor, hailing from Caroline. Though his primary focus was agriculture, his time in politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering dedication to personal liberty and his outspoken advocacy for limited government. His agrarian worldview served as the foundation for his political beliefs, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw a unique opportunity in the nascent United States to establish an ideal system of governance.  Free from the constraints of established traditions, the nation's founders could construct a system of self-government. He held strong convictions about the inherent rights of individuals, believing them to be interconnected—the denial of one right jeopardized them all, diminishing the value of the remaining freedoms.  These rights, he argued, should be protected from government encroachment.\n\nTaylor believed that what some termed the \"state of nature\"  favored those with physical strength and cunning, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.  \n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent duality of human nature—both good and evil.  He firmly adhered to a dualistic moral framework, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167).  He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and limit the influence of capitalism. He asserted that a government founded on these principles would function equitably regardless of its administrators, who he acknowledged would inevitably be driven by self-interest.\n\nTaylor believed that self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, but it became problematic when it transcended the creation of a society that served the common good and instead fostered sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others. A well-structured government, he argued, was crucial to containing this inherent human tendency toward self-interest, and even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, favoring a limited federal government with powers explicitly enumerated in the document. He recognized that a more expansive federal government could lead to despotism and financial burden. However, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, arguing that without considering the intent of the framers, such an approach could easily be corrupted. He even considered the Declaration of Independence a more definitive charter of the United States, as it more explicitly portrayed the nation as a collection of independent states rather than a unified entity.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This decrease was unexpected and the contributing factors remain somewhat unclear.\n\nThe onset of winter on a New England campus likely influenced the drop, as fewer individuals opt for cycling or walking as transportation methods during colder weather. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity for students and faculty, potentially leading to a decline in log submissions due to competing priorities. Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, a time of heightened festivities and a month-long break for both students and staff, during which campus attendance is considerably reduced. The subsequent resumption of classes in late January may also explain the low log submissions for that month.\n\nHowever, the low submissions in February remain puzzling, suggesting that other factors may be at play. It is conceivable that any new initiative experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline in engagement. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a concentrated campaign designed to revitalize the project. This strategy successfully resulted in an increase in log submissions for that month.\n\nThus, a key challenge encountered was maintaining project momentum despite both the anticipated decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks inherent in the higher education environment.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for this project, and indeed any initiative promoting alternative commuting methods, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving.\n\nTo incentivize the adoption of alternative transportation, we provided a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and a selection of national chain stores. While these incentives proved effective, it would be interesting to explore the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, on participation. Such substantial rewards could have potentially mitigated the dip in engagement observed during the project.\n\nWhile the nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, offering progressively larger incentives over time might have yielded more favorable results. The initial gift cards were sufficient at the project's outset, but announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially stimulated further participation and engagement.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) functions as a type of security designed to mirror the performance of a pre-defined benchmark, such as a stock market index, a commodity, or a collection of assets.  Similar in concept to an index fund, ETFs offer the advantage of diversification while also enabling the flexibility of trading on an exchange, much like individual stocks.  Investors can engage in strategies like short selling, margin buying, and even purchase as little as a single share in any given transaction.  Despite these appealing features, a key advantage of ETFs lies in their typically lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge certain drawbacks.  For instance, trading ETFs incurs a commission fee, similar to buying or selling individual stocks.  Furthermore, while the range of available ETFs is extensive, it's crucial for discerning investors to critically assess the claimed benefits, such as diversification, and determine their actual extent and relevance to individual investment objectives.\n\nThis analysis will focus on a specific ETF, designated IHF, and compare its performance against the top ten holdings that constitute a substantial portion of its assets – approximately 63.58%.  The goal is to evaluate whether the purported advantages of owning a single ETF truly align with the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio comprised of these ten individual stocks.  Additionally, we aim to explore alternative configurations of these stocks that might yield a more favorable risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\n\nTo streamline the evaluation process, we've narrowed our focus to the top ten holdings, as analyzing every single asset within the ETF would be impractical. The specific holdings and their corresponding percentage allocation to the ETF's total assets are detailed below.\n\nTo gauge how effectively these ten stocks represent the overall performance of ETF IHF, we can leverage their existing asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their individual contributions to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return.  This calculation assumes that the portfolio is entirely composed of these ten stocks in the exact proportions held by the ETF. The resulting beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nA notable observation from the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings generates a return 6.11% higher than the ETF IHF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the beta of these ten stocks is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole.  These preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top ten holdings could potentially achieve higher returns with reduced volatility.  However, it's important to acknowledge that these differences in means may not be statistically significant.\n\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of these portfolio performance variations, we'll analyze the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks.  These standard deviations will be normalized to 100% for comparative purposes, allowing us to assess their cumulative impact on volatility in relation to the overall standard deviation of ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finest poetic achievements.  Within this poem, the term \"Thulé\" appears in lines 6 and 56, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by scholar Charles E. Mabbott.  Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island located north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost boundary of their known world. While Virgil's usage is confirmed, another, more contemporary source warrants consideration.  Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature. \n\nA significant element supporting this connection is found in a comparison between Poe's work and that of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a celebrated German author.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" analyzes the similarities between their respective poems, concluding that Poe likely drew inspiration from Goethe's work.  The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts – the first in 1808 and the second, posthumously, in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of this epic poem lies a shorter piece titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem centers on a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet.  Consumed by grief following her passing, he descends into heavy drinking and despair.  Ultimately, he decides to end his life, distributing his possessions to his children, except for the goblet.  He then proceeds to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and takes his own life.  The emotional state and description of the King of Thulé bear a striking resemblance to the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" potentially reflecting Poe's own experiences of loss and his struggle with alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe employs \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works.  While he uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" this term appears twice in \"Dream-Land,\" serving as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces.  In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscapes of Thulé, depicting them as dark and desolate, haunted by the presence of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These themes resonate with those found in \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe, who, following the loss of his wife, experiences loneliness and a waning will to live. The entire poem appears to be a reflection of the speaker stepping into the world created by Goethe.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is undeniable.  Even if Poe admired Tennyson for no other reason, his exposure to Goethe's works would have been extensive due to the numerous reproductions circulating after the original publications.",
            "The question of whether punitive damages are applicable in a situation involving a customer's injury from a slip-and-fall accident due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store, particularly when the store manager allegedly exhibited disregard for the potential harm, is a matter of legal scrutiny.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded in circumstances where a defendant's actions demonstrate \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  To substantiate a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence suggesting the defendant's conduct was characterized by a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result, as well as exhibiting despicable behavior.\n\nThe case of Jennifer Palmer, who sustained injuries from slipping on an applesauce spill, raises the possibility of a successful punitive damage claim. Ms. Palmer's legal argument hinges on the contention that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have been aware of the potential danger posed by the spill, given that prior incidents of slips and falls had occurred at the store. Mr. Martin's alleged inaction, despite being notified about the spill twice, strengthens Ms. Palmer's argument. While the argument that Mr. Martin's actions were \"despicable\" may be less compelling, it remains a reasonable assertion considering the history of similar incidents at the store.\n\nThe timeline of events leading to Ms. Palmer's injury is significant. On October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, independently informed Mr. Martin about the applesauce spill. Mr. Martin, reportedly on a dinner break, dismissed their concerns. Subsequently, at 5:30 pm on the same day, Ms. Palmer slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury.\n\nCalifornia law permits the recovery of punitive damages in situations where a defendant's conduct meets the criteria of \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  Courts have interpreted \"malice\" to encompass actions intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, actions that are \"despicable\" and demonstrate a deliberate disregard for the rights or safety of others.\n\nThe legal team is currently evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim, taking into consideration the specific facts and legal precedents in this case.",
            "During my time at CBC, I enrolled in an introductory course on Islam.  One of the enduring discussions we had centered on the nature of Islam – was it inherently hostile? This question, I believe, holds even greater significance in today's world. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've observed a dramatic shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents, progressing from a stance of hostility and demonization to a seemingly excessive level of acceptance within American society. It's hard to imagine, in the wake of 2001, that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his family's history, could even be considered.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad sparked my curiosity. My prior understanding, gleaned from historical accounts, painted a picture of Muhammad as a forceful figure who coerced tribes into converting to Islam through conquest. However, this biography presented a different perspective – one of a misunderstood martyr, even someone who exhibited humility, drawing individuals to his teachings organically.\n\nCertain parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the accounts of Muhammad's 'miracles' also caught my attention. One example that stands out is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a large group, echoing the biblical accounts of Christ's miracles. This stylistic choice led me to believe the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who didn't need to prove himself but lived authentically, performing miracles as a natural consequence of his connection to truth.  \n\nThis approach, however, felt problematic to me. It seemed to diminish the significance of Jesus' miracles and life, potentially appropriating elements of his story for Muhammad. \n\nFurthermore, the biography frequently relies on accounts relayed through intermediaries – \"so-and-so heard from so-and-so\" – which ultimately raises questions about the reliability of the information.  \n\nWhat ultimately troubled me most was the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue, a gentle, wise, and endearing figure. This portrayal seemed at odds with historical accounts of his rise to power, leading me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the complexities of Muhammad's legacy.",
            "The philosophical and theological teachings attributed to Jesus Christ underwent significant transformations in the wake of his life, diverging from the original tenets he espoused. A historical examination reveals a gradual shift in Christian thought, moving away from its perceived foundations. Contemporary society, characterized by a growing awareness and a progressive ethos, presents a dynamic landscape where traditional perspectives, while persisting, may struggle to exert widespread influence.  \n\nLooking towards the future, a burgeoning historical consciousness within Christianity is anticipated. This will likely fuel a desire to disentangle the doctrines that have accumulated over time from the core message of Jesus. While this process may unfold over decades or even centuries, its trajectory appears inevitable: a resurgence of early Christian principles. A movement, gaining momentum, will progressively shed layers of accumulated doctrines, akin to a rewinding of time, ultimately culminating in a re-emphasis on the essence of Jesus' teachings as understood within his historical context.\n\nThis resurgence, upon reaching the United States and Europe, will likely inspire widespread adherence to a more fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity, mirroring the beliefs and practices of Jesus' era. Despite the emphasis on theological regression, the institutional Church is anticipated to remain a powerful force, guiding this transformation. However, the theological landscape will witness a shift from the current diversity of Christian denominations and beliefs towards greater uniformity.\n\nThroughout history, we observe instances of significant reversals. The conversion of the Roman Empire from persecutor to proponent of Christianity is a notable example. Similarly, the United States has witnessed a transformation from a system of racial enslavement to a leadership role for African Americans. A comparable reversion, driven by a yearning for historical authenticity, is foreseen within the realm of Christianity.\n\nCrucial to this process will be a shift in interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. Examining the historical context of Jesus' teachings reveals that his origin lies within Judaism. By the time Roman rule commenced in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had established itself as a monotheistic religion, with a divinely revealed scripture and a structured hierarchy.  Within this religious landscape, diverse factions emerged, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the broader population of common people.",
            "\"The Jungle,\" by Upton Sinclair, offers a stark portrayal of human nature, suggesting a deep-seated tendency towards greed and self-preservation. The novel vividly illustrates this through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their own wealth and success above all else.  \n\nSinclair masterfully uses imagery to depict the exploitative environment of Packingtown. He describes the factory buildings as \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" with \"great chimneys...streaming away to the end of the world,\" emphasizing the relentless pollution and disregard for the environment. The surrounding area, plagued by \"animal feces and urine runoff,\" further underscores the callous indifference towards the well-being of both people and animals.\n\nThe novel paints a bleak picture of the working conditions endured by factory employees.  Driven by their relentless pursuit of profit, the owners and managers treat their workers as expendable tools.  As Sinclair writes, the workplace is a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  Employees are subjected to grueling hours and the constant threat of sudden layoffs without any compensation or support. \n\nThe lack of legal protections during this era allowed the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to endure hazardous conditions and risking their health and safety. Despite the dire circumstances, there were limited avenues for workers to seek assistance or improve their plight. While unions existed, they were often ineffective, perpetuating a cycle of exploitation.\n\nSinclair's powerful language evokes a sense of desperation and hopelessness, comparing the workers of Packingtown to slaves bound to a brutal system. He argues that with their lives hanging \"on the verge of starvation,\" and subject to the whims of \"brutal and unscrupulous\" masters, the workers were trapped in a situation mirroring the conditions of chattel slavery.",
            "Authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes.  The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of such methods in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" One notable technique involves juxtaposing adjectives and nouns that don't conventionally align, thereby creating a unique aura surrounding a subject. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them for similar effect.  He employs this latter technique extensively with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. \n\nThroughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald constructs layers of meaning around colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to evoke specific feelings associated with pivotal objects.  \n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is that of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class, while gray signifies a sense of age and fading. This association is established early in the novel through frequent uses of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" (8); indeed, everyone appears to be adorned in white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he encounters Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instances where individuals are not wearing white occur when Nick is observing Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40).\n\nFitzgerald further solidifies these color meanings by applying them to commonplace, seemingly insignificant subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's partygoers appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary people or places in terms of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established sufficient meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This utilization of color symbolism to convey meaning begins with Daisy. After an extended period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers consequently perceive Daisy as less of a distinct character and more as a uniform element, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy as a uniform addition through phrases like \"a gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural scene, fueled by its pleasant, sunny weather. Farmers cultivate a variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.  The demand for organic produce from locally sourced Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs is significant in the San Diego region, with numerous organizations experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also popular among consumers. Many organic farms have embraced additional revenue streams by offering tours of their operations, along with recreational activities like hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor pursuits. This type of model allows landowners to potentially benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat, creating recreational opportunities, and establishing avenues for educational programs or income generation. \n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially lucrative niche market, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in the surrounding plant and animal life. This is due to the absence of chemical inputs in the soil and water. However, organic farming does present some financial challenges compared to conventional methods. It often requires more hands-on labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as to fertilize the soil naturally.  Furthermore, losses due to pests and diseases can be higher with organic practices.  Smaller organic farms may also struggle to achieve the same economies of scale as larger operations.  Additional practices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also lead to increased labor costs. These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotation, managing invasive species, and actively shaping plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or patches of open ground.  These factors highlight the reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nOur case study focuses on a 160-acre parcel of land located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  The property is a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, an area covered by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan.  Although still under review, this plan encompasses over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.  Other species, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon face endangered status.\n\nThis area has a long history of human presence, initially inhabited by Native Americans for centuries.  Later, it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s.  This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and/or timber production for many years.\n\nThe selection of this property was based on information gathered from a real estate website.  A thorough examination of available government programs was then conducted to assess the potential options for a small farmer seeking to mitigate costs while implementing wildlife-friendly practices. As a model for potential outcomes, an existing organic farm in the same area was identified and studied.",
            "Cultural nuances significantly influence the dynamics of any negotiation. Culture is a complex tapestry woven from both explicit and implicit threads, defying simplistic categorization. It is neither monolithic nor static, and generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify its multifaceted nature. While acknowledging broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a truly effective negotiator delves deeper, seeking to understand the specific cultural context of the negotiation and its potential impact on the interaction. \n\nWhen encountering a foreign culture, individuals inevitably draw comparisons to their own, leading to both insights and potential pitfalls.  Navigating cultural differences requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical understanding, awareness of cultural biases, and a willingness to embrace cultural diversity. Rather than imposing one's own cultural lens, it is crucial to approach unfamiliar cultures with respect and a genuine desire to understand their values and norms. This is especially vital when entering a negotiation with a weaker bargaining position, as cultural sensitivity can serve as a bridge over potential divides.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to recognize that cultural influences extend beyond national boundaries. Within any given nation, corporations often cultivate their own distinct cultures, shaping employee behavior and interaction. These corporate cultures manifest in various ways, from dress codes and communication styles to hiring practices and charitable initiatives. The spectrum of corporate cultures within a single nation, such as the United States, highlights the diversity of values and perspectives that can coexist within a shared cultural framework.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is paramount, as they provide the underlying motivations and beliefs that guide behavior. For instance, a culture that prioritizes \"saving face\" or communal harmony may discourage public displays of conflict or confrontation, while a culture that emphasizes individual achievement might prioritize a more aggressive negotiation style. Recognizing these underlying values can empower negotiators to tailor their approach and build rapport with counterparts from different cultural backgrounds. While general cultural insights are valuable, building a personal connection with the opposing party can further enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The statement, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. This phrase serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God.  This belief, seemingly shared by another prominent theologian, Thomas Aquinas, forms the foundation for our comparative analysis.  Since both philosophers aim to defend the existence of the same God—specifically, the God described in the Bible—we will proceed on the assumption that both believe in this deity.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison as their arguments are tailored to a specific understanding.  While both Anselm and Aquinas present compelling points, neither, in my view, offers a completely comprehensive rationale for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's examine Anselm's central argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection in comprehending God. He posits that because God exists within our conceptual framework, we cannot truly conceive of his absence. Though his presentation, with its specific terminology, can be somewhat dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that proof of God's existence resides within the realm of our own minds.  Anselm suggests that we needn't rely on external evidence to find truth about God; rather, the existence of this being is inherently true within our own understanding. This reliance on concepts that lack irrefutable empirical evidence is often termed \"faith\" within Christian discourse.\n\nAquinas, however, diverges from Anselm's approach. He argues that the existence of God can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it could potentially attract new adherents without requiring them to accept something unprovable. Instead, they could be convinced through logical reasoning alone. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the existence of God is a logical necessity.  An analogy could be made to a missing puzzle piece: if you have assembled the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can infer the features and existence of the missing piece without having to actually see it.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, later known as Buddha, was born. His life journey led him to renounce worldly possessions and attain enlightenment, ultimately giving rise to Buddhism. The oldest and most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism, which has evolved significantly over its two and a half thousand years of existence.  This evolution is evident in various practices, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation. Both monks and lay followers participate in this ritual, though its origins are not directly linked to Buddha's teachings. These variations extend beyond surface-level customs to encompass the very essence of the religion, influencing both monastic and lay interpretations of Theravada Buddhist doctrine.\n\nThroughout history, the Theravada Buddhist community has navigated both internal and external influences, both positive and negative. To understand these forces, several key terms will be frequently employed. \"Internal\" refers to influences originating from individuals within the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. \"External\" refers to influences stemming from individuals outside of Buddhism. \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to damage or detract from the Buddhist community, often driven by misconceptions or prejudice. Conversely, \"benign\" forces, while not necessarily intending to help or harm, might inadvertently impact the community as a consequence of their actions. These terms will serve as a framework for analyzing the forces shaping Theravada Buddhism.\n\nA fundamental understanding of Theravada Buddhism requires exploring its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\" – the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, the Buddhist scriptures divided into three baskets. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines monastic discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores Buddhist metaphysics. This metaphysical framework includes concepts like Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in existence), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these truths is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and achieving liberation from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living, outlining five precepts for lay followers (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants). Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. Central to Buddhist thought is the Four Noble Truths: 1) Dukkha – life involves suffering; 2) attachment causes suffering; 3) suffering can be overcome; and 4) the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico provides a compelling case study of a prolonged rivalry, lasting from 1836 to 1893.  This period, marked by numerous conflicts, reached its peak with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, resulting in a significant territorial shift in favor of the United States. While numerous clashes occurred throughout this era, tensions finally subsided on the eve of World War I.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry stemmed from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests. This pattern of rivalry between neighboring countries is not unique.  Shared borders often lead to friction and divergent viewpoints, as seen in the enduring tensions between the United States and Mexico.  Historian David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that \"Mexico and Cuba stand out as enduring diplomatic challenges for the United States\" (p. 41), highlighting the persistent nature of these relationships.  Geographically proximate and historically rivals, these nations contrast with others in Latin America who have enjoyed more amicable ties with the United States.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"while Americans in the twentieth century opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  This echoes the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, where ideological differences mingled with competition for strategic advantage.  In the case of the United States and Mexico, the ideological struggle centered around religious preferences, fueled by pre-existing mistrust stemming from the colonial eras.  The legacy of English-Spanish rivalry cast a long shadow on early diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period. The majority of these conflicts revolved around territorial issues, including border incursions and frontier skirmishes.  Banditry and lawlessness along the shared border remained a persistent problem until both nations implemented stricter border security measures (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States economically and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico towards the latter part of the nineteenth century (p. 109, 110).",
            "A life-altering event occurred fifteen years ago, thrusting me into a world of unexpected challenges.  The illness, previously unknown to me, abruptly ended my career as a nurse. While I had chosen nursing for its perceived stability, driven by a childhood yearning for security, my true aspirations lay elsewhere—in the realms of science and journalism.  Despite this, I found myself at forty-six, single, and facing a future without income or the ability to work.\n\nThe reality of disability, a constant companion for fifteen years, has stripped away my financial reserves, leaving me with a profound sense of vulnerability. Social Security Disability benefits provide a bare minimum, each day a struggle for financial stability and emotional well-being.  Uncertainty has become a defining characteristic of my life. \n\nHowever, amidst this adversity, a unwavering truth has emerged: I could not have persevered without the unwavering support of my family and a few steadfast friends.  Their compassion has been a lifeline, a testament to the human capacity for connection and care.\n\nLife is inherently unpredictable, rife with both minor and major upheavals.  While preparedness is essential, certain events transcend individual capabilities, demanding a collective response. \n\nWhile I agree that excessive reliance on government institutions is unwise, I believe fostering a spirit of mutual trust and interdependence is paramount.  Rather than isolating ourselves in self-reliance, we should cultivate a culture of support, where individuals feel empowered to seek and offer assistance.\n\nAmerican history is often romanticized as a story of rugged individualism, but the truth is more nuanced. Our forefathers' resilience stemmed not solely from self-reliance, but from compassion, mutual respect, and a willingness to share resources.  The pioneers who traversed the American West did not conquer the wilderness alone; their success was built on cooperation and community.\n\nTherefore, let us embrace preparedness while simultaneously nurturing a sense of interconnectedness.  I, for one, have taken steps to ensure my safety and well-being, stockpiling essential supplies and learning essential skills.  \n\nBut alongside these practical measures, let us not forget the importance of building strong relationships with our neighbors. Community is our bedrock, a source of strength and support when life inevitably throws curveballs.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the ways they do has long fascinated scientists. Are there inherent limitations or guiding forces that shape the course of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that even the simplest organic forms remained elusive to precise mathematical description,  recent advancements in mathematical modeling offer new perspectives. Researchers have started applying these models to understand the broader aspects of mollusk shell development, both in terms of individual growth (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). This study investigates how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in the genus *Prunum*, alongside experimental research, can shed light on the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes.\n\nUsing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantifiable anatomical parameters. These parameters were then incorporated into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. This allowed us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological variations within *Prunum*. The results of these models are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary trends within this group.\n\nThe structure of a shell can be conceptualized as a tube traversing through a three-dimensional space over time. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella.  The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the base being the opposite end. The aperture is an opening through which the animal extends from its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the observer and the apex points upwards.\n\nCounting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective, identifying the starting point of the first suture, and drawing a line dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are then counted from this line, with estimations made to the nearest quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be interpreted as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By plotting the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with its horizontal and vertical radius, we can trace the path of the aperture. This trajectory can then be represented both visually and mathematically.\n\nOnce a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, allowing us to explore the factors influencing shell development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in neonatal and infant mortality over the last decade has been stagnant. Despite advancements in sectors like water and sanitation, aligning with Millennium Development Goals, child and maternal health improvements fall short of the necessary trajectory to meet the 2015 target.  Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind these shortcomings is crucial, suggesting a stronger emphasis on health system fortification rather than isolated programmatic interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has witnessed a positive shift in the proportion of births attended by skilled health professionals, reaching 72%, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners like midwives who lack the capacity to manage complicated pregnancies. Consequently, a significant portion of maternal deaths are attributed to hemorrhage, highlighting a misleading perception of progress.  Similarly, the decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases among children under five receiving professional treatment warrants concern. Data gaps exist regarding postnatal care, but existing information indicates a nationwide deficiency in this area.\n\nC-section rates remain below expectations at approximately 4%.  Furthermore, the disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) c-section rates underscores an equity issue in healthcare accessibility.  Urban areas appear to dominate access to healthcare services, while a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles points to a vertical equity challenge.  Financial barriers, likely driven by out-of-pocket costs, appear to hinder the poor's access to healthcare.\n\nMoving forward, improving neonatal and maternal care hinges on effectively addressing service gaps.  Should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, particularly pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children?\n\nProgrammatic solutions, while appealing due to their targeted objectives and faster results, present drawbacks.  Concentrating resources on a single health sector often neglects other areas, leading to a potential drain on human resources and funding.  Furthermore, multiple parallel programs risk service duplication and uncoordination, resulting in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its frequent exploration of the aristocratic class. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend, with works like \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" deviating from the established norms. Both novels introduce elements of mystery and the uncanny, characteristics less common in typical Victorian fiction. This distinctive approach strengthens the characters, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\": \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”  \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose of these moments vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, his vulnerabilities, and his perception of the events unfolding around him.  The shooting of Oliver, revisited vividly in chapter 28, serves as a powerful example. He relives the event as if in a dream while desperately seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the situation and his deteriorating physical condition, underscored by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" taking him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, leaving him with a constant, gnawing fear. The question arises: whose will is responsible for Oliver's misfortune? It is clearly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver lacks agency, unable to exert control even in the face of imminent danger. A sense of defeat pervades this experience, suggesting that Fagin's influence has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react.  \n\nAnother example of this dreamlike quality can be found in \"Wuthering Heights\": \n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with elementary students in an after-school program, providing academic support. While I could assist in various subjects, my expertise lay in English and reading.  I was approached by a teacher to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling significantly with reading. He seemed to have unusual difficulties. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were completely foreign to him; it was quite perplexing. \n\nAdrian, who I believe was in third or fourth grade, was of Latino heritage, but spoke English fluently. We faced challenges until I met his mother. While assisting with childcare for a few students who remained behind during a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived.  She communicated solely in Spanish, as her English was limited. My own Spanish skills were rudimentary at the time, but we managed to establish a basic understanding.\n\nThat's when a realization struck me: Adrian wasn't unable to read; he simply lacked a solid grasp of the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this insight ultimately proved beneficial, but I sincerely hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the significant issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It also demonstrates that challenges aren't always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can pose a considerable obstacle. This problem is undeniable, so what can we do to address it?\n\nIn Adrian's case, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring him in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English proficiency, the solutions are far more complex. There isn't a single, definitive answer. \n\nDual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes – none of these approaches alone offer a complete solution. The key lies in a multifaceted approach that incorporates all these elements. \n\nFirst and foremost, dual language programs are a valuable concept, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all students. Studies have shown that children in these programs often outperform their peers academically.\n\nDespite their merits, these programs face resistance, with concerns about resource allocation and the perceived lack of benefit for the majority of students. These fears are unfounded. If we implemented dual language programs more broadly, rather than as an exception, all students would reap the rewards.\n\nBut how do we achieve this?  Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical and unrealistic. However, I strongly believe that we can and should have bilingual support staff, such as tutors or aides, to assist in these programs.",
            "From youth, many of us are instilled with the understanding that there exists something beyond our grasp, something vast and enigmatic. Some seek answers in organized religion, be it Sunday school or temple, while others embark on a journey of introspection. Tradition often guides our beliefs, leading us to embrace the faiths of our parents. However, some reject these tenets entirely, clinging to the conviction that knowledge resides solely within the confines of their own personal experience. Our values may evolve, shifting and transforming over time. Regardless of the path we choose, we strive to define ourselves through our individual perspectives on spirituality, searching for a guiding light to illuminate our way through darkness and into the realm of understanding.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I questioned my father about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the steady drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop to our conversation. Our cigarettes burned between us as we watched water cascade down the gutters, drowning the plants lining the edge of the porch.  He gazed out at the rain, his eyes distant, as if lost in thought, perhaps retracing memories. His physique had become more fragile, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair, once thick, was now thin and sparse. He avoided my gaze, his eyes fixed on the relentless downpour.  A profound sense of isolation washed over me, a fear of confronting the inevitable truth, the reality that I would soon be without him.  To speak of it aloud would only solidify its existence, making it all too tangible.  I held him close, retreated to my chair, and pulled it closer to his, joining him in silent contemplation of the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nMy father's life ended in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, though they prolonged his suffering, failed to alleviate it.  He lingered for months beyond the doctors' predictions, but the value of those extra days remained elusive to me.  \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered to myself in the stillness of the night.  My prayers were absent, as if God had ceased to hear my pleas long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final passage, to see the life that had given birth to me fade away. So I chose not to be present.  I refused to watch the man who had shaped me, whose love had nurtured me, succumb to death.  I yearned to remember him through the vibrant tapestry of his life, not through the bleakness of his demise. I knew him better than anyone else, better even than his own family, and I was certain he wouldn't desire his only child to be a mere observer at his departure. For three days, I retreated into the sanctuary of my bed, a cocoon of grief, waiting for the news.\n\nSilence met my anticipation.  No one called.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt aptly points out in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" presents an intriguing paradox: it's simultaneously old and new.  This literary genre has been subject to a range of critical responses, from dismissals for its perceived lack of depth to celebrations of its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, skillfully blends elements from both ancient and modern romances, forging a novel mode of literary expression. Walpole ingeniously interweaves traditional theatrical elements with a contemporary focus on nature, as he himself describes in his preface (\"A Gothic Story,\" 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily upon medieval gothic theater, architecture, and cultural traditions. \n\nEven in the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, the term \"Gothic\" was already associated with a variety of cultures, styles, and historical periods. It often carried connotations of archaism or cultural primitivism when juxtaposed against the perceived advancements of the modern era. The unique convergence of the theatrical \"Gothic\" style with the novel's emerging format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, has contributed to the enduring appeal of Gothic literature.  It allows the genre to remain both timeless and strikingly contemporary for readers distanced from its origins.\n\nOne of the most prominent themes recurring in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideals of knightly training and conduct are both preserved and reinterpreted in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers because it embodied ideals of courage, honor, and competence—qualities they often saw as lacking in contemporary society, particularly figures like Walpole himself. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and used as a means to critique and potentially improve the present.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have harbored anxieties about the future.  This context may have led him to reflect, perhaps unconsciously, on the perceived moral and inherent goodness of individuals during the \"Gothic\" era, contrasting it with the perceived failings of his own time. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic.  Even before his introduction, the reader is presented with descriptions that highlight his chivalric traits:\n\n[Insert the original description of Frederic here]\n\n\nThe depiction of Frederic is infused with traditional chivalric imagery. He is, first and foremost, a prince who has endured suffering, been deeply affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by enemies. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous knight\" is, of course, heightened, introducing the soon-to-be-canonical Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The intricate network of processes involved in getting products from a customer's order to their doorstep is known as supply chain management.  Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this concept encompasses the comprehensive planning, execution, and oversight of every stage, from raw materials to finished goods, with the ultimate goal of fulfilling customer needs swiftly and efficiently.  Six key elements underpin this complex system: production, supply, inventory management, location optimization, transportation logistics, and information flow. By skillfully managing these elements, businesses strive to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain. It defines the \"who, what, when, and where\" of manufacturing, ensuring alignment with customer demand.  Market analysis plays a crucial role in understanding these demands, guiding decisions about product development and production volume. Once production plans are established, the next step involves determining the optimal location for manufacturing, considering factors like production capacity, quality standards, and proximity to both suppliers and customers.  \n\nFollowing location selection, managers focus on meticulous scheduling and equipment maintenance to ensure smooth and efficient production.  Every detail in this stage is critical, as even minor oversights can lead to significant time and financial losses down the line.  Illustrating this point, my experience working at retail giants like Walmart and Target highlighted the importance of standardized processes. From employee attire to receiving shipments, meticulously documented procedures ensured clarity and consistency, enabling these massive organizations to operate seamlessly.\n\nThe next vital element is supply, encompassing strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.  A company might have multiple production divisions specializing in various aspects of a single product. Managers must carefully allocate production tasks to the most suitable division based on its equipment, workforce, and expertise. \n\nFurthermore, outsourcing specific processes can be a strategic advantage, allowing companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality products flexibly while minimizing costs.",
            "On a bustling city corner, Ellen Page, renowned for her role in the film \"Juno,\" stood alone, a hand-held sign held aloft.  The stark message, scrawled in black marker, declared: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a powerful military junta that seized control in 1962 through a coup.  The year 2007 witnessed a surge in public demonstrations, the first in a decade.  These protests, led primarily by Buddhist monks clad in saffron-colored robes, came to be known as the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government permitted these peaceful gatherings, but tensions escalated rapidly, culminating in what some described as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military.  Monasteries were raided, and foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned. Tragically, Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, lost his life on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a protest. While official reports cite 13 deaths, a defected army colonel, Hla Win, claimed that the true number of casualties was significantly higher, potentially reaching several thousand.\n\nThis pattern of brutality is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have sought to silence dissent and maintain absolute power. Ancient Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, divinely ordained to govern every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors were revered as gods, credited with guiding their people towards prosperity through technological innovation and the ritual of seppuku.  Even contemporary political figures, such as former U.S. President George W. Bush, have been associated with controversial figures and organizations.\n\nHistory provides numerous stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where intellectuals, activists, and students gathered to demand democratic reforms, resulted in a violent crackdown. The official death toll remains disputed, with estimates ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s witnessed the systematic extermination of Tutsis and political moderates by Hutu militias, backed by the government.  And the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany during World War II, stands as a horrifying testament to the consequences of racial hatred and intolerance.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz landscape is largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his keen ability to mold his orchestra. While his piano presence often takes a subtle role in the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his creation of intricate and multifaceted pieces that allowed his band members to showcase their individual talents. He meticulously constructed frameworks that encouraged improvisation while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and phrases tailored to the unique styles of each musician, thereby highlighting specific musical ideas. This approach also served to shape the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in coherent and distinctive sonic textures that complemented each composition. Ellington's masterful grasp of both the individual players' sounds and their collective synergy enabled him to produce some of the most innovative and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sonic innovations, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his lifelong practice of utilizing voice \"as a jazz instrument.\" This early composition demonstrates Ellington's ability to incorporate voice as a textural and timbral element without relying on conventional lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also exemplifies his talent for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues structure unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between voice and reeds, where the vocal line commences smoothly and melodically, gradually transitioning to a more rugged sound towards its conclusion.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that embellishes the basic melody while emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. This time, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, taking on a more instrumental role as a soloist.\n\nTag: A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, unconventional ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice to enhance the tonal color of this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that permeates his entire oeuvre. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly blends his mastery of tight orchestration with his keen ear for tonal nuance. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice, creating a rich and harmonious sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further extends these ideas, as Ellington brilliantly utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "A persistent yearning had always resided within her. This unexplainable need, a void begging to be filled, first emerged during her adolescence, at the tender age of fourteen. Three years later, at seventeen, the longing persisted.  While she had begun to realize she craved connection, specifically with a person rather than a material object, no one captured her interest. Despite the advances of several boys, who awkwardly attempted to woo her with little success, she remained unaffected. This peculiarity led to much introspection, causing her to ponder the reasons behind her lack of romantic inclination. Years of contemplation had yielded various theories, but none that truly satisfied her search for an explanation.  \n\nLife unfolded, punctuated by her persistent questioning of desires that seemed to defy societal norms. \n\nHer daily existence was typically serene.  Her parents, individuals of remarkable tranquility, rarely engaged in conflict, and disagreements with their daughter were equally uncommon. Their sole point of contention was her assertion of independence and her vibrant personality, which, while charming and endearing, sometimes clashed with their more subdued natures.\n\nHowever, today's tranquility was shattered. As she moved through the house in search of inspiration, a sharp cry echoed from the kitchen, her mother's voice laced with pain.  Panic surged within her as she rushed to the source of the sound, her voice trembling with concern, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" \n\nThere she found her mother lying on the floor, visibly distressed, her words punctuated by gasps of pain.  Rushing to her side, her daughter offered comfort. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were strained and whispered, revealing the intensity of her suffering.\n\n\"Okay, Mom,\" she replied, her voice firm despite her own rising anxiety. \"Just tell me where to pick you up.\" Following her mother's instructions, she swiftly carried her to the car, carefully laying her in the back seat.  \n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital mingled with the undercurrent of fear, but her focus remained solely on her mother's well-being.  She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical assistance as she went.  Concerned faces gathered around, and a rolling bed was quickly brought to her mother's side. They whisked her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to wait, consumed by worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the connection between following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\"  and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a tailored version of the Med diet, characterized by a focus on plant-based foods, including protein sources like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while excluding potatoes. It emphasizes monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and includes fish, with reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted within this dietary pattern.\n\nPrevious studies had shown a link between adherence to a Med diet and a decreased risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. In fact, a trial found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels (specifically, lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). However, these prior studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states.  Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each woman six times, using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess their dietary intake from the previous year.  Remarkably, over 95% of the nurses remained involved in the study throughout this entire 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies to ensure their accuracy.  Information about CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke cases was confirmed through review of medical records, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, though this applied to about 17% of all stroke cases and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.  For each FFQ, researchers calculated body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Starting in 1986, they also assessed leisure-time physical activity.\n\nTo minimize random variation for each individual and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary habits, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. These averages combined scores from the two preceding years. To account for potential confounding factors (variables that could influence the results), adjustments were made for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. Separate models were used to analyze fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe findings revealed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a greater aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of developing both CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a significant downturn for the United States economy, characterized by a severe financial crisis.  Unemployment rates climbed, the housing market experienced a substantial decline, and numerous prominent corporations faced substantial challenges. This economic instability has persisted, prompting a critical examination of its origins and potential solutions.  \n\nA key contributing factor to this crisis was a combination of political decisions and insufficient oversight within the financial sector.  Pressure exerted on banks and lending institutions led to the widespread issuance of sub-prime loans, further exacerbated by an immature and inadequately regulated financial infrastructure. \n\nSimultaneously, government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were encouraged to package these mortgages into complex financial instruments known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, the financial system experienced a ripple effect, as banks faced depleted capital reserves and transferred the resulting losses onto these repackaged mortgages and, consequently, the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the late 1990s, during President Clinton's second term. In an effort to secure re-election, the administration implemented policies aimed at expanding homeownership, including relaxing lending standards. This move, while seemingly beneficial at the time, ultimately created a foundation for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded years later.  Journalists and analysts, such as Steven Holmes of the New York Times, raised concerns about the potential consequences of these relaxed regulations, predicting a scenario similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nThe complexity of modern mortgage products, including adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs, further contributed to the crisis. These intricate financial instruments interconnected various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial institutions.  \n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.  Major investment banks, collectively holding an estimated $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, faced severe consequences. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at discounted prices, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to restructure as commercial banks under stricter regulatory oversight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with approximately $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, that stage in a narrative where authors attempt to convey backstory and world-building, can be a double-edged sword. While it offers the chance to paint a vivid picture for the reader, it also walks a tightrope between enriching the story and overwhelming it with unnecessary information.  \n\nExperienced writers understand the importance of \"showing, not telling,\" yet even they can sometimes fall prey to lengthy exposition dumps. These moments, where narrative momentum stalls and information feels forced, can leave readers disengaged and longing for the story to progress. \n\nThink of exposition as a bridge between the known and the unknown. It sets the scene, introduces characters, and establishes the context for the unfolding events. However, this bridge should be traversed efficiently and organically, seamlessly woven into the narrative fabric.\n\nConsider a scenario where a story informs the reader about a central character's past love and subsequent tragedy.  Instead of simply stating that the heroine met her beloved, married them, and then witnessed their untimely demise, a skilled writer would delve deeper. They would reveal the depth of their love through dialogue, interactions, and subtle details that showcase their bond. \n\nFor instance, we might see glimpses of the husband's devotion in his actions, his words, and his mannerisms.  Similarly, the heroine's character could be illuminated through her reactions to him, her memories, and her reflections on their shared experiences.  This approach not only provides a richer understanding of the characters but also creates an emotional connection with the reader, making their grief and loss more poignant.\n\nUltimately, the goal of exposition is to inform and engage without interrupting the flow of the story. It's about providing the necessary context while allowing the narrative to breathe and evolve organically.",
            "I observed two news broadcasts originating from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. My first viewing was of NBC 4's live morning broadcast. The lead story focused on a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot displayed. The report, lasting approximately two minutes, indicated multiple stab wounds and his subsequent arrest. The brevity seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe subsequent segment addressed the early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Critically injured, he remained unidentified by authorities at the time. The SWAT Team was engaged in the investigation. This story felt comparatively brief, leading me to speculate whether the brevity stemmed from the victim's race or the location of the incident. A recurring observation of mine is the underrepresentation of minority victims in media coverage. It appears that cases involving white victims often receive significantly more attention, be it kidnappings, disappearances, or other crimes. \n\nFurther coverage included a report on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The incident site and the determination of a .22 caliber rifle being the source of the projectile were detailed. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension.\n\nA brief segment followed, focusing on the anticipated rain and thunderstorms for the upcoming weekend, with temperatures predicted to remain in the mid-to-low eighties. This seemingly concise report served as a \"teaser\" to encourage viewer engagement. \n\nAnother story involved a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I noted an emphasis on the suspect's race and complexion, which seemed disproportionate to the narrative.\n\nFinally, the broadcast covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, sentenced to 300 months for conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. The unusual phrasing of his sentence, instead of stating the typical 25 years, struck me as peculiar. The mention of Rodriguez's Hispanic ethnicity also seemed tangential to the core story.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, an unyielding and everlasting tie. Within this bond reside a multitude of emotions: affection, admiration, envy, and even ruthlessness, to name a few. Brothers possess an understanding that transcends ordinary relationships, a profound insight into one another's souls. In their reflections, they see not just an image, but a mirror reflecting their truest selves. When faced with adversity, the essence of this bond is revealed, manifesting either in acts of extraordinary compassion or unspeakable darkness. These emotions, when laid bare, carry a weighty consequence.  Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal link necessitates confronting the repercussions they inevitably bring. When one can gaze into a brother's eyes and perceive their own reflection staring back, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they truly are. The essence of their character lies not in their intentions, but in the actions they take and the consequences that follow. In the narrative \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a journey exploring this intricate theme, delving into the tempestuous emotions that accompany it.  \n\nSet against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered landscapes, these two young boys set off on a journey destined for futility.  A palpable clash of bitter disappointment and fervent pride erupts in the narrative's climax, leaving only one brother to emerge from the ordeal alive. This central theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which illuminates the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world around him—influences that profoundly shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be distilled to a singular, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial forays together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors a sense of resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother with whom he could share his worldly knowledge, someone who could keep pace with him in activities such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desired a companion who could join him in adventures like \"racing to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\"  These aspirations, however, are dashed against the reality of Doodle's condition.  Born with a frail heart, Doodle's survival was precarious, and participation in vigorous physical activity seemed an impossibility. For the young protagonist, whose mind brimmed with boundless energy and imagination, this realization was a devastating blow. His dreams were shattered, leaving him consumed by disappointment.  Indeed, his resentment towards the younger child manifests in a chilling thought: contemplating infanticide by smothering him with a pillow. Such a thought, born of frustration and despair, speaks volumes about the protagonist's internal struggles. Yet, a glimmer of his innate love for his brother surfaces when the child offers a simple smile. This small gesture instills a flicker of hope in the protagonist's heart, suggesting that his dark inclination was perhaps not as deeply rooted as he initially believed.",
            "The intricate workings of the human brain, a marvel of biological engineering, have long fascinated thinkers and scientists alike. As our understanding of this complex system has evolved, so too have the analogies used to describe its functions. From ancient comparisons to the malleability of wax tablets to the structured organization of papyrus scrolls, and later to the computational power of modern computers, each metaphor sheds light on certain aspects of the brain's workings while ultimately falling short of capturing its full complexity.\n\nThe process of information acquisition begins with sensory input, where specialized receptors translate external stimuli, such as tactile sensations, temperature variations, sound waves, or light particles, into electrochemical signals. These signals then undergo a series of transformations within the intricate neural networks of the brain, guided by both bottom-up and top-down processing mechanisms. Consider, for instance, the perception of a simple image: a black square against a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes individual elements, such as color, shape, and spatial relationships, gradually assembling these pieces into a coherent whole – the recognition of a square. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages existing knowledge and expectations to expedite this recognition, allowing us to swiftly identify the object as a square rather than, say, a void within the white space.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an intricate attentional filter comes into play, selectively prioritizing certain signals based on their perceived significance. This filter, akin to a gatekeeper, ensures that our cognitive resources are allocated efficiently. For example, while our visual system may register every blade of grass beneath our feet, our attentional filter prevents us from consciously perceiving each individual blade, allowing us to focus on more salient stimuli. Conversely, our name, even amidst a cacophony of sounds, will readily capture our attention. This interplay between processing stages and attentional modulation is a fundamental aspect of how the brain orchestrates our perception and understanding of the world.\n\nTo effectively process information, the brain relies on sophisticated memory systems. These systems, which include sensory, working, and long-term memory, enable us to encode, store, and retrieve information over varying durations. Encoding, the initial stage of information storage, involves transforming sensory input into a format that can be stored in the brain. Different types of sensory stimuli may be encoded in distinct ways. For instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (based on the visual appearance of the word), phonemically (based on its sound), or semantically (based on its meaning). Once encoded, information is maintained within different memory stores. Working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, is thought to be maintained through a continuous loop of electrical signals circulating through specific neuronal pathways. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be encoded within the intricate structures of proteins.\n\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Several models have been proposed, drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model, the semantic network model, posits that concepts are represented as nodes, and these nodes are interconnected based on their semantic relationships. For example, the concept of \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" creating a network of interconnected ideas.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" presents a chilling vision of a future where technological advancement and a rigid capitalist system intertwine to create a dystopian society. In this world, the emphasis on communal harmony overshadows individual expression, and citizens are meticulously conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else.  They exist as cogs in a vast machinery, their thoughts and actions meticulously controlled by the World Controller, who enforces a singular, unquestioned ideology.  Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's profound unease regarding the trajectory of these very systems.\n\nTerms like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist theory, resonate throughout the novel, suggesting that Huxley viewed the burgeoning economic landscape of his time with both fascination and trepidation. He satirizes capitalism through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class, preoccupied with their own immediate needs, remains blind to the true power dynamics at play. This ideological manipulation, reminiscent of the control exerted over the proletariat in Marxist thought, is evident in the conditioning of the World State's citizens. The lower castes, designated as Delta, Gamma, and others, lack independent volition. Their desires are relentlessly shaped through \"hypnopædia,\" a form of sleep-learning,  to fuel a relentless cycle of consumption and spending. This manipulation, orchestrated by the World Controller, highlights the insidious nature of hegemony, a system where a dominant group exerts control over subordinate classes. The lower castes remain blissfully unaware of this manipulation, unwittingly perpetuating the very system that keeps them subjugated. While the upper classes, such as the Alphas and Betas, possess the capacity for awareness, they largely remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions without question.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in \"Brave New World\" are strangely sterile, lacking the depth and complexity that mark genuine human connection. Their interactions are superficial, often reduced to superficial observations about physical appearance or fleeting encounters. This absence of genuine emotional bonds underscores Huxley's chilling suggestion that the relentless march of technology and unchecked capitalism may ultimately strip humanity of its capacity for love, empathy, and meaningful expression. The characters themselves seem interchangeable, further emphasizing the dehumanizing effects of this engineered society.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned approximately two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus, a challenge faced by many, including myself, has been a recurring topic of discussion. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the sprawling campus, excluding, of course, the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my residence to classes held in distant locations like Willard building, closer to the heart of campus, frequently involved a trek of up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when inclement weather – a frequent occurrence in State College – presented obstacles. Through conversations with an alum, not significantly older than myself, I learned that the East Halls dormitories were once isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of undeveloped land. Today, this once-vacant space has undergone a remarkable transformation, now accommodating sports fields, substantial new constructions such as the modern Creamery and the recently erected health services building, and a ring of residential apartments. As our campus continues to expand, the task of traversing this increasingly complex landscape becomes progressively more demanding.\n\nA pressing question arises: what constitutes the most effective solution to this mobility challenge? For a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a strong contender. However, the bicycle alone cannot provide a complete answer. Student adoption is crucial, and the campus infrastructure must be thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of cyclists.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had reintroduced cycling into their life after a multi-year hiatus revealed their astonishment at ever having abandoned this mode of transportation. \"Bikes are truly exceptional,\" they remarked, \"during a period when cycling wasn't considered fashionable, it remained the most practical means of getting around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling boasts remarkable efficiency. A modest breakfast of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel you for 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, located a comparable distance from the campus center as certain dormitories.  The most astute decision I have made this year was the acquisition of a bicycle. Daily, I attend classes in Thomas building, a location easily a 25-minute walk from my residence. Cycling can significantly reduce this travel time to a mere 5 minutes, provided a brisk pace is maintained.\n\nUnfortunately, Pollock Road, the most direct route from my home to Thomas building, presents challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists. While walking offers its merits, my current schedule leaves little room for extended walks. In the absence of my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable option for reaching classes. A daily trek to Thomas on foot would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours each week. Accounting for the time required to walk to and from other classes, appointments, and various other commitments, this additional walking time would be unsustainable."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aspiration to pursue social work stems from a deep-seated desire to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicating my efforts to supporting children who have endured abuse or neglect and providing crucial assistance to families facing challenges.  The core values that I believe I can contribute to this field are service, respect, ethical conduct, and a steadfast commitment to fostering improved relationships both within families and within the broader community.  Moreover, I am dedicated to continuous professional development, ensuring I remain well-equipped and knowledgeable in my chosen field.  These values are not merely professional ideals; they are deeply ingrained in my personal philosophy.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have always felt a strong call to assist others, though my specific path remained unclear. Observing individuals grappling with difficulties, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, fueled my desire to make a meaningful difference. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, hoping to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior and its complexities.  Upon graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took some time to reflect and explore different avenues.\n\nOne summer day, a chance encounter with a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. This experience profoundly impacted me, prompting me to reach out to the boy's parents in an attempt to offer support and advocate for his well-being. While legal intervention was not immediately possible, my conversation with the parents revealed their own struggles and a reluctance to acknowledge the severity of the situation. This encounter solidified my conviction to pursue a career in social work, where I could directly address the needs of vulnerable children and families facing similar challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value I hold dear and believe is essential to the field of social work.  As a society, we often celebrate individuality while simultaneously adhering to rigid societal norms and expectations. This paradox highlights the need to challenge these norms and advocate for genuine equality and inclusivity. Throughout my academic years, I actively engaged in various forms of activism, expressing my commitment to social justice through my personal style, my involvement with the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance (GSBA), and my unwavering stance against racism and discrimination. I believe in fighting for a more equitable and just society and will continue to use my voice and actions to promote these values.",
            "This paper examines the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological model centers on genetic predispositions and physiological factors influencing sleep. In contrast, sociocultural models explore the interplay between environmental influences and aspects such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographic background. This review will analyze research relevant to both models, elucidating each study's findings and critically evaluating its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders stemming from medical or substance-related factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias involve difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, and sleepwalking disorder. Sleep disorders linked to mental health can arise from either Axis I disorders (clinical disorders) or Axis II disorders (personality disorders or intellectual disabilities). This review will primarily focus on insomnia and, to a lesser extent, primary sleep disorders, analyzing them through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genes, inherited traits, and physiological mechanisms.  Neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, particularly the orexin-producing neurons, plays a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles.  Research utilizing animal models, such as mice, has revealed phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that are implicated in sleep-wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. Studies have shown that GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that findings from animal models may be applicable to humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Variations or malfunctions in this receptor could potentially disrupt sleep patterns, potentially requiring medication for adequate rest. From a sociocultural perspective, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence an individual's sleep patterns, and alterations in the receptor could naturally predispose them to sleep difficulties. This could have a profound impact on various aspects of life, including academic performance, professional success, and daily activities requiring sustained attention and focus.",
            "This paper explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  It begins with a concise definition of the disorder. Next, it delves into the diagnostic process, outlining common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the paper concludes with practical strategies that classroom teachers in inclusive settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD),  describes the efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  More specifically, (C)APD refers to the brain's processing of sound information and the neurological activity underlying this processing, leading to specific electrical responses in the auditory system (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Essentially, CAPD is a condition where the brain struggles to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD typically have normal hearing; they can perceive sounds, but the part of the brain responsible for translating those sounds, distinguishing words, and separating speech from background noise, functions differently than usual.\n\nEarly recognition of what would become known as CAPD emerged in the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Researchers examining children with communication difficulties began exploring this concept.   In 1954, an Italian research team, including Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, started developing assessments for these children.  Building on this, Kimura, in 1961, introduced \"dichotic testing\" and proposed a model explaining the physiology of the CNS involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A significant national conference in 1977 spurred further research focused on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways.  Some individuals may have difficulty locating or perceiving sounds in space, distinguishing between two or more sounds, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech (such as recognizing sarcasm based on changes in tone). They might struggle to filter out background noise, synthesize auditory cues (interpreting sounds meaningfully), or determine the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive process that includes observing listening behaviors and evaluating auditory function through a range of tests conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other qualified professionals (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These evaluations may incorporate questionnaires, surveys, observations of auditory behaviors, and responses to specific auditory stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted test for diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many assessments present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and require them to differentiate specific elements, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the intricate consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a tool for deception, ultimately, individuals must confront their true selves to avoid losing their identity. However, the act of revealing the truth can lead to social isolation.  One must then grapple with a difficult choice: preserving one's authentic self or maintaining relationships with those around them.  Though some may react neutrally to being deceived, others might be deeply hurt and offended by the charade. \n\nThe play delves particularly into the complexities of deception when it involves gender role reversal. A crucial question arises: why do characters choose to adopt a different gender identity? In Viola's case, her decision stems from a need for protection. Arriving in a foreign land, she adopts the guise of a man to safeguard herself from potential harm: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nWhile this strategy proves effective, it simultaneously distances Viola from the female community, severing a vital support system. Ironically, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian, resulting in romantic entanglement: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Moreover, Viola grapples with suppressed feelings for Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nAlthough this dynamic might appear progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on how deception may inadvertently expose hidden emotions. Olivia and Orsino's reactions to Viola/Cesario suggest repressed desires that are brought to the surface. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario rooted in his perceived masculinity, or does it hint at a deeper, perhaps subconscious, inclination towards women?  It's plausible that Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia satirizes the superficial judgments prevalent in his era, as evidenced by her swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her eventual acceptance of Viola as family rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "The impact of German colonialism on various regions has been widely studied, with particular emphasis on the tragic events surrounding the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa. However, it is crucial to recognize that such a vast and complex empire as Germany's colonial holdings cannot be solely defined by this singular act of brutality. The German colonial experience was characterized by a diverse range of policies and administrative approaches, mirroring the varied geographical landscapes it encompassed.\n\nEducational initiatives across the colonies also exhibited significant variations.  When the British assumed control of German East Africa (later known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable population of educated and literate Africans.  Similarly, German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary scholars.\n\nIn stark contrast to this scenario, South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a drastically different picture.  Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government actively established state schools and played a central role in the education of indigenous populations, South West Africa saw native education largely entrusted to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  However, the German administration did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing more substantial funding and oversight to missionary institutions. The ramifications of these divergent educational policies persisted long after the termination of German rule. While other German colonies boasted a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, a vast majority of the population remained unschooled and illiterate.\n\nA confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark contrast in educational outcomes. This study aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing particularly on recent research that sheds light on the attitudes and perspectives of colonial settlers and authorities towards African natives.\n\n\nExisting scholarship on education within the German colonial empire is extensive. A significant portion of these sources are in German and were produced during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary objective of earlier works was to document the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific educational facets. These investigations highlighted significant disparities in the educational structures of different colonies.\n\nA seminal work that directly addresses the theme of this paper is Cohen's study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen juxtaposes the educational systems of these two colonies, exploring the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining many of the unique characteristics of the colony's educational system.\n\n\nSouth West Africa, compared to other German colonies, enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although arid desert regions spanned much of the territory. The European population of South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music over the past century has resulted in a vast and ever-expanding array of genres, making a definitive catalog nearly impossible. This complexity is further amplified by the proliferation of subgenres within each established category – think rock, country, jazz, folk, rap, and countless others.\n\nAmong these, Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most dynamic and expressive genres in the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its capacity to explore a wide spectrum of emotions, often gravitating towards the darker and more intense. This genre's diversity is equally noteworthy, as its early iterations quickly revealed a remarkable malleability, prompting artists to carve out unique subgenres, which in turn spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, creating a constantly evolving landscape.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is characterized by a dizzying array of niches, making it challenging to pinpoint a singular definition of what constitutes \"heavy metal.\"  Despite its diverse influences, the genre undeniably has roots in a specific historical context. To fully comprehend the multifaceted nature of Metal music prevalent today, one must first delve into the origins of the Metal movement itself, understanding its unique trajectory beyond the confines of a mere musical genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is, in many ways, a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It can be perceived as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatrical elements.  It challenges primitivism, prioritizing technical proficiency and skilled musicianship, evident in the intricate compositions and performances of Metal artists.\n\nFurthermore, Metal is undeniably intertwined with the influence of psychedelic drugs. The mid-1970s witnessed a surge in drug use, fueling a creative explosion that resulted in unconventional and boundary-pushing music.  Drugs, in many cases, served as both inspiration and a scapegoat for these sonic explorations.\n\nMetal's dark and visceral qualities were a stark departure from the prevailing trends in popular music at the time, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the human experience. Later generations of Metal artists drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's exploration of darkness and emotional intensity, echoing those themes in their own music.\n\nLyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this inherent darkness:\n\n\nThese lyrics, often cited as a harbinger of Heavy Metal, reveal a darker side to the band, characterized by a volatile emotional landscape, potentially influenced by drug use. Considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Heavy Metal, it emerged as a response to the Rolling Stones' own foray into heavier, darker territory.  The Beatles sought to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity, ultimately including \"Helter Skelter\" on their groundbreaking album, The White Album.",
            "Many years before Surrealism emerged with its dreamlike canvases, a painter named Henri Rousseau was diligently crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" transcends the image of a woman awestruck by the wonders of her slumbering world. It also serves as a reflection of Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the outset of his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from the art community. Yet, he faced a profound internal conflict: should he conform to prevailing artistic trends to gain approval from the critical world he deeply admired, or should he embrace his own unique vision, forging an independent path?  \n\n\"The Dream\" stands as the culmination of this lifelong struggle within Rousseau's artistic soul. To truly grasp its essence, one must delve into the artist's life story.  Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau's early life was far removed from the world of art. His father, a prosperous businessman, offered no formal artistic training. Instead, Rousseau worked for the French government as a toll collector until the age of forty. Despite this unconventional background, a profound personal tragedy – the loss of his wife and eight young children – compelled him to seek solace in painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau, a true folk artist, captured the hopes and dreams of ordinary people.\n\nRousseau's intense desire for acceptance within the art world is understandable when viewed through the lens of his circumstances.  His late start in art, coupled with his lack of formal training, placed him at a disadvantage amidst a generation of talented and celebrated artists.  Even as his artistic career progressed, recognition eluded him until around the same time that Henri Matisse began to establish himself as a leading figure in the art world. Author Jan Gordon, in her book \"Modern French Painters,\" illuminates the stark contrast between the two artists. While both competed for recognition, Gordon argues that their motivations and approaches were fundamentally different: Matisse, driven by a fear of producing commonplace art, and Rousseau, who longed to create works so conventional that they would grant him entry into the prestigious “Artiste Français.”",
            "Throughout history, numerous thinkers have explored the intriguing relationship between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental connection between truth and beauty. This belief resonates deeply with me, echoing the sentiment expressed by John Keats in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge stems from formal education or personal experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics appears to be more intuitive. As Keats implies, these concepts seem to be grasped instinctively rather than through conventional learning. \n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics, in essence, strive to describe rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty primarily aim to elucidate the reasons behind the captivating nature of a work of art or literature, or the ethical implications of certain actions. These pursuits are less about establishing rigid rules for artistic creation or moral conduct and more about illuminating the underlying principles that govern these realms.\n\nFurthermore, critical analysis of art or morals often falls short of fully capturing their essence.  For instance, dissecting the merits of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might involve examining elements like composition, lighting, or historical context, yet these factors alone fail to fully explain its artistic merit. When asked about a cherished piece of art or literature, we frequently find ourselves uttering phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" before delving into more elaborate explanations. This suggests that art and morals possess an intangible quality that transcends mere description.  \n\nSimilar to Flannery O'Connor's assertion that \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way,\"  literature and art possess an inherent depth that defies complete articulation. No matter how meticulously we analyze their elements, a certain ineffable quality remains. I believe ethics shares this same characteristic. As Wittgenstein states, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" This elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, arguably constitutes the most compelling aspect of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that establishes a profound connection between them.\n\nThe profound link between morality and art stems from our deeply personal and experiential engagement with both. They resonate with us on a level that transcends mere intellectual comprehension. This connection is particularly evident in literature.  As McKean aptly observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its distinct culture woven through its diverse landscapes. From the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the Baltic coastal city of Kiel, a shared cultural identity prevails. This cultural tapestry can be traced along the Rhine River, passing through Cologne and reaching the historic Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this rich cultural heritage, it's not surprising that contemporary Germany emerged from a confluence of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people is known as Germania. The origins of the name remain a subject of debate among scholars and historians. Tacitus, a renowned Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before their westward migration and subsequent conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often engaging in skirmishes (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Caesar's use of the term may have originated from the Gauls themselves, who employed it to distinguish their enemies. In the opening chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories suggest the name \"Germania\" might relate to the spear, known as a \"ger,\" used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly derive from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying a boisterous or noisy nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" Tacitus, the Roman historian, described the origins of the German people.  He argued that the Germans were an indigenous population, distinct from other races and unmixed through migration or intermingling.  He wrote: \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\n\nDuring the first century AD, Germanic tribes resided along the fringes of the Roman Empire. They traded goods obtained from their lands and contributed to the Roman army, offering their skills as soldiers (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).  While Romans ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely remained within the confines of their vast empire.",
            "The scene below held me captive, my mind absorbing the details without truly processing them. It was a detached observation, a practiced gaze that analyzed without engaging. Thoughts flickered in and out of awareness, fleeting and ephemeral. My consciousness moved with such fluidity, it felt as though I were merely experiencing, rather than thinking.\n\nI had once attempted to learn to draw, inspired by an artist I knew. I picked up a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" hoping to unlock the secrets of artistic expression. It covered everything from the fundamentals of drawing to the intricate workings of the brain's visual perception. One technique it emphasized was the use of a frame, a way of simplifying complex images. Imagine a bustling kitchen scene, a bowl of fruit on a table, and with a mental frame, you isolate just the fruit, transforming the overwhelming into the manageable.\n\nBut at that moment, staring down at the bowl before me, I couldn't summon that mental frame. I was overwhelmed, awestruck.  Artists like Picasso and Monet, masters of color and form, had their signature styles. If I dared to dream of artistic expression, this was where it would begin, my own unique story unfolding.\n\nMy hand hovered over the object of my artistic endeavor, muscles tensed and released as I moved. My mind's intent took shape in a moment that felt charged with creative possibility. Water swirled, a serene and flawless expanse, crystal clear and pure. Particles detached from the whole and vanished into nothingness.  \n\nMuscles tightened, spasmed, and jerked with a growing unease. My hand struck the toilet handle again, a forceful thrust.  The stubborn brown mass resisted, clinging stubbornly to the porcelain.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie a constricting band around my neck, I frowned. My gaze fell on the unwelcome offering left behind, a reminder of the unsavory reality of cleaning bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper, mummifying itself like an oven mitt. Rising to my feet, then bending at the waist, I dipped my hand into the bowl, a slow, deliberate movement, like a mother venturing into a hot oven.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage fatalities on the road demands our immediate attention.  Several contributing factors converge to create a dangerous situation for young drivers. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health highlights the developmental immaturity of the adolescent brain, which is not fully equipped to handle the complexities and risks associated with driving.  In addition to this biological factor, the undeniable reality of inexperience plays a crucial role. This lack of experience not only elevates the likelihood of fatal accidents but also increases the incidence of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. \n\nFurthermore, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly exacerbates the risks faced by young drivers.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center established a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents involving teen drivers.\n\nRecognizing this urgent need for intervention, several states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses designed to mitigate these dangers. These licenses impose restrictions on driving hours and prohibit younger passengers.  \n\nHowever, while these measures offer a temporary solution, they fail to address the fundamental issue: the inherent vulnerability of young drivers.  Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, a respected psychologist, argues that even the age of 18 is too young to grant unrestricted driving privileges. His research suggests a persistent inclination towards risk-taking among individuals under the age of 20, fueled by a desire for thrill-seeking.  \n\nDelaying the acquisition of a full driver's license until this tendency towards risk-taking diminishes would be a prudent step towards reducing the alarming number of teen driver fatalities.  The looming arrival of a new wave of young drivers, the children of the Baby Boomer generation, presents a significant challenge. By 2010, millions of these teenagers will be eligible to drive, potentially leading to a catastrophic surge in accidents unless we take decisive action.\n\nA comprehensive legislative solution is clearly warranted.  Driver's education could continue to be provided in schools as a foundational step in the learning process.  However, the minimum driving age should be raised to 18, with provisional permits issued prior to granting full driver's licenses.  Practical driving training hours would remain a requirement, building upon the existing standards set by most states.  California, for example, currently mandates 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nUniform, nationwide legislation on this issue would be a logical and effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country.\n\nThe proposal outlined here is not a radical departure from existing practices.",
            "A closer examination of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films revealed a fascinating set of fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901.  These short films primarily relied on clever editing techniques to create captivating illusions. My research primarily concentrated on analyzing the stylistic conventions employed in the majority of these trick films, as well as identifying any unique or innovative characteristics present in a few of the later productions. \n\nThe typical trick film of this era adhered to a distinct visual language.  Often set within a confined indoor space framed by a frontal proscenium, these films featured minimal camera movement, relying on long and medium shots.  A significant characteristic was the adherence to a strict principle where a single conceptual shot corresponded to a complete film.  However, a few pioneering works at the dawn of the twentieth century challenged these established norms by incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne recurring visual element shared by these trick films is the setting within an interior, enclosed by the boundaries of a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary within this proscenium, refraining from following figures or objects as they moved. This compositional style, common in early cinema, drew inspiration from the theater and, specifically, vaudeville and magic performances. This stage-bound approach, however, imposed limitations on the movement of characters within the films.  They generally moved side-to-side, confined to a horizontal axis and never advancing towards or receding from the camera.  Consider, for example, the action in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side and perform their actions along this horizontal plane, even exiting the frame without the camera pursuing them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also influenced the choice of shot types.  Long shots and, less frequently, medium shots predominated in these films.  Close-ups, a technique that would become commonplace in later filmmaking, were entirely absent. This mirrored the theatrical tradition, where the audience enjoyed a complete view of the entire performance within the confines of the stage.  As actors typically remained in the middle ground and did not move towards or away from the camera, close-ups were simply not employed.\n\nIn most early trick films, a single conceptual shot corresponded to a complete film. This limitation typically restricted the length of these films to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also constrained the narrative potential of these films, which primarily focused on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearances, and object manipulations, often lacking a substantial storyline.  \n\nIt's important to note, however, that a single \"shot\" in the viewer's perception might not necessarily equal a single physical shot.  To create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, a single \"shot\" could be a compilation of several individual takes spliced together. A close examination of \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals this technique.  Although the film appears as a single continuous shot, a closer inspection unveils the precise moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins.",
            "A figure of prominence in the early days of the Republican movement was John Taylor, hailing from Caroline. Though his primary focus was agriculture, his time in politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering dedication to personal liberty and his outspoken advocacy for limited government. His agrarian worldview served as the foundation for his political beliefs, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw a unique opportunity in the nascent United States to establish an ideal system of governance.  Free from the constraints of established traditions, the nation's founders could construct a system of self-government. He held strong convictions about the inherent rights of individuals, believing them to be interconnected—the denial of one right jeopardized them all, diminishing the value of the remaining freedoms.  These rights, he argued, should be protected from government encroachment.\n\nTaylor believed that what some termed the \"state of nature\"  favored those with physical strength and cunning, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.  \n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the inherent duality of human nature—both good and evil.  He firmly adhered to a dualistic moral framework, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167).  He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agriculture, and limit the influence of capitalism. He asserted that a government founded on these principles would function equitably regardless of its administrators, who he acknowledged would inevitably be driven by self-interest.\n\nTaylor believed that self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, but it became problematic when it transcended the creation of a society that served the common good and instead fostered sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others. A well-structured government, he argued, was crucial to containing this inherent human tendency toward self-interest, and even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, favoring a limited federal government with powers explicitly enumerated in the document. He recognized that a more expansive federal government could lead to despotism and financial burden. However, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, arguing that without considering the intent of the framers, such an approach could easily be corrupted. He even considered the Declaration of Independence a more definitive charter of the United States, as it more explicitly portrayed the nation as a collection of independent states rather than a unified entity.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This decrease was unexpected and the contributing factors remain somewhat unclear.\n\nThe onset of winter on a New England campus likely influenced the drop, as fewer individuals opt for cycling or walking as transportation methods during colder weather. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity for students and faculty, potentially leading to a decline in log submissions due to competing priorities. Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, a time of heightened festivities and a month-long break for both students and staff, during which campus attendance is considerably reduced. The subsequent resumption of classes in late January may also explain the low log submissions for that month.\n\nHowever, the low submissions in February remain puzzling, suggesting that other factors may be at play. It is conceivable that any new initiative experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline in engagement. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a concentrated campaign designed to revitalize the project. This strategy successfully resulted in an increase in log submissions for that month.\n\nThus, a key challenge encountered was maintaining project momentum despite both the anticipated decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks inherent in the higher education environment.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for this project, and indeed any initiative promoting alternative commuting methods, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving.\n\nTo incentivize the adoption of alternative transportation, we provided a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses such as restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and a selection of national chain stores. While these incentives proved effective, it would be interesting to explore the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric cars, on participation. Such substantial rewards could have potentially mitigated the dip in engagement observed during the project.\n\nWhile the nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, offering progressively larger incentives over time might have yielded more favorable results. The initial gift cards were sufficient at the project's outset, but announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially stimulated further participation and engagement.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) functions as a type of security designed to mirror the performance of a pre-defined benchmark, such as a stock market index, a commodity, or a collection of assets.  Similar in concept to an index fund, ETFs offer the advantage of diversification while also enabling the flexibility of trading on an exchange, much like individual stocks.  Investors can engage in strategies like short selling, margin buying, and even purchase as little as a single share in any given transaction.  Despite these appealing features, a key advantage of ETFs lies in their typically lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge certain drawbacks.  For instance, trading ETFs incurs a commission fee, similar to buying or selling individual stocks.  Furthermore, while the range of available ETFs is extensive, it's crucial for discerning investors to critically assess the claimed benefits, such as diversification, and determine their actual extent and relevance to individual investment objectives.\n\nThis analysis will focus on a specific ETF, designated IHF, and compare its performance against the top ten holdings that constitute a substantial portion of its assets – approximately 63.58%.  The goal is to evaluate whether the purported advantages of owning a single ETF truly align with the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio comprised of these ten individual stocks.  Additionally, we aim to explore alternative configurations of these stocks that might yield a more favorable risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\n\nTo streamline the evaluation process, we've narrowed our focus to the top ten holdings, as analyzing every single asset within the ETF would be impractical. The specific holdings and their corresponding percentage allocation to the ETF's total assets are detailed below.\n\nTo gauge how effectively these ten stocks represent the overall performance of ETF IHF, we can leverage their existing asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their individual contributions to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return.  This calculation assumes that the portfolio is entirely composed of these ten stocks in the exact proportions held by the ETF. The resulting beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nA notable observation from the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings generates a return 6.11% higher than the ETF IHF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the beta of these ten stocks is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole.  These preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio limited to the top ten holdings could potentially achieve higher returns with reduced volatility.  However, it's important to acknowledge that these differences in means may not be statistically significant.\n\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of these portfolio performance variations, we'll analyze the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks.  These standard deviations will be normalized to 100% for comparative purposes, allowing us to assess their cumulative impact on volatility in relation to the overall standard deviation of ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finest poetic achievements.  Within this poem, the term \"Thulé\" appears in lines 6 and 56, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by scholar Charles E. Mabbott.  Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island located north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost boundary of their known world. While Virgil's usage is confirmed, another, more contemporary source warrants consideration.  Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature. \n\nA significant element supporting this connection is found in a comparison between Poe's work and that of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a celebrated German author.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" analyzes the similarities between their respective poems, concluding that Poe likely drew inspiration from Goethe's work.  The Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as the celebrated author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts – the first in 1808 and the second, posthumously, in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within the second part of this epic poem lies a shorter piece titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem centers on a king whose wife dies after gifting him a goblet.  Consumed by grief following her passing, he descends into heavy drinking and despair.  Ultimately, he decides to end his life, distributing his possessions to his children, except for the goblet.  He then proceeds to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and takes his own life.  The emotional state and description of the King of Thulé bear a striking resemblance to the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" potentially reflecting Poe's own experiences of loss and his struggle with alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe employs \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works.  While he uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" this term appears twice in \"Dream-Land,\" serving as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces.  In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscapes of Thulé, depicting them as dark and desolate, haunted by the presence of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These themes resonate with those found in \"The King of Thulé\" by Goethe, who, following the loss of his wife, experiences loneliness and a waning will to live. The entire poem appears to be a reflection of the speaker stepping into the world created by Goethe.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is undeniable.  Even if Poe admired Tennyson for no other reason, his exposure to Goethe's works would have been extensive due to the numerous reproductions circulating after the original publications.",
            "The question of whether punitive damages are applicable in a situation involving a customer's injury from a slip-and-fall accident due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store, particularly when the store manager allegedly exhibited disregard for the potential harm, is a matter of legal scrutiny.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded in circumstances where a defendant's actions demonstrate \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  To substantiate a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence suggesting the defendant's conduct was characterized by a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result, as well as exhibiting despicable behavior.\n\nThe case of Jennifer Palmer, who sustained injuries from slipping on an applesauce spill, raises the possibility of a successful punitive damage claim. Ms. Palmer's legal argument hinges on the contention that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have been aware of the potential danger posed by the spill, given that prior incidents of slips and falls had occurred at the store. Mr. Martin's alleged inaction, despite being notified about the spill twice, strengthens Ms. Palmer's argument. While the argument that Mr. Martin's actions were \"despicable\" may be less compelling, it remains a reasonable assertion considering the history of similar incidents at the store.\n\nThe timeline of events leading to Ms. Palmer's injury is significant. On October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, independently informed Mr. Martin about the applesauce spill. Mr. Martin, reportedly on a dinner break, dismissed their concerns. Subsequently, at 5:30 pm on the same day, Ms. Palmer slipped on the spill and sustained a serious back injury.\n\nCalifornia law permits the recovery of punitive damages in situations where a defendant's conduct meets the criteria of \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  Courts have interpreted \"malice\" to encompass actions intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, actions that are \"despicable\" and demonstrate a deliberate disregard for the rights or safety of others.\n\nThe legal team is currently evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim, taking into consideration the specific facts and legal precedents in this case.",
            "During my time at CBC, I enrolled in an introductory course on Islam.  One of the enduring discussions we had centered on the nature of Islam – was it inherently hostile? This question, I believe, holds even greater significance in today's world. Reflecting on events since 9/11, I've observed a dramatic shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents, progressing from a stance of hostility and demonization to a seemingly excessive level of acceptance within American society. It's hard to imagine, in the wake of 2001, that a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his family's history, could even be considered.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad sparked my curiosity. My prior understanding, gleaned from historical accounts, painted a picture of Muhammad as a forceful figure who coerced tribes into converting to Islam through conquest. However, this biography presented a different perspective – one of a misunderstood martyr, even someone who exhibited humility, drawing individuals to his teachings organically.\n\nCertain parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the accounts of Muhammad's 'miracles' also caught my attention. One example that stands out is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a large group, echoing the biblical accounts of Christ's miracles. This stylistic choice led me to believe the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who didn't need to prove himself but lived authentically, performing miracles as a natural consequence of his connection to truth.  \n\nThis approach, however, felt problematic to me. It seemed to diminish the significance of Jesus' miracles and life, potentially appropriating elements of his story for Muhammad. \n\nFurthermore, the biography frequently relies on accounts relayed through intermediaries – \"so-and-so heard from so-and-so\" – which ultimately raises questions about the reliability of the information.  \n\nWhat ultimately troubled me most was the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue, a gentle, wise, and endearing figure. This portrayal seemed at odds with historical accounts of his rise to power, leading me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the complexities of Muhammad's legacy.",
            "The philosophical and theological teachings attributed to Jesus Christ underwent significant transformations in the wake of his life, diverging from the original tenets he espoused. A historical examination reveals a gradual shift in Christian thought, moving away from its perceived foundations. Contemporary society, characterized by a growing awareness and a progressive ethos, presents a dynamic landscape where traditional perspectives, while persisting, may struggle to exert widespread influence.  \n\nLooking towards the future, a burgeoning historical consciousness within Christianity is anticipated. This will likely fuel a desire to disentangle the doctrines that have accumulated over time from the core message of Jesus. While this process may unfold over decades or even centuries, its trajectory appears inevitable: a resurgence of early Christian principles. A movement, gaining momentum, will progressively shed layers of accumulated doctrines, akin to a rewinding of time, ultimately culminating in a re-emphasis on the essence of Jesus' teachings as understood within his historical context.\n\nThis resurgence, upon reaching the United States and Europe, will likely inspire widespread adherence to a more fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity, mirroring the beliefs and practices of Jesus' era. Despite the emphasis on theological regression, the institutional Church is anticipated to remain a powerful force, guiding this transformation. However, the theological landscape will witness a shift from the current diversity of Christian denominations and beliefs towards greater uniformity.\n\nThroughout history, we observe instances of significant reversals. The conversion of the Roman Empire from persecutor to proponent of Christianity is a notable example. Similarly, the United States has witnessed a transformation from a system of racial enslavement to a leadership role for African Americans. A comparable reversion, driven by a yearning for historical authenticity, is foreseen within the realm of Christianity.\n\nCrucial to this process will be a shift in interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. Examining the historical context of Jesus' teachings reveals that his origin lies within Judaism. By the time Roman rule commenced in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had established itself as a monotheistic religion, with a divinely revealed scripture and a structured hierarchy.  Within this religious landscape, diverse factions emerged, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the broader population of common people.",
            "\"The Jungle,\" by Upton Sinclair, offers a stark portrayal of human nature, suggesting a deep-seated tendency towards greed and self-preservation. The novel vividly illustrates this through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their own wealth and success above all else.  \n\nSinclair masterfully uses imagery to depict the exploitative environment of Packingtown. He describes the factory buildings as \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" with \"great chimneys...streaming away to the end of the world,\" emphasizing the relentless pollution and disregard for the environment. The surrounding area, plagued by \"animal feces and urine runoff,\" further underscores the callous indifference towards the well-being of both people and animals.\n\nThe novel paints a bleak picture of the working conditions endured by factory employees.  Driven by their relentless pursuit of profit, the owners and managers treat their workers as expendable tools.  As Sinclair writes, the workplace is a \"seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  Employees are subjected to grueling hours and the constant threat of sudden layoffs without any compensation or support. \n\nThe lack of legal protections during this era allowed the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing workers to endure hazardous conditions and risking their health and safety. Despite the dire circumstances, there were limited avenues for workers to seek assistance or improve their plight. While unions existed, they were often ineffective, perpetuating a cycle of exploitation.\n\nSinclair's powerful language evokes a sense of desperation and hopelessness, comparing the workers of Packingtown to slaves bound to a brutal system. He argues that with their lives hanging \"on the verge of starvation,\" and subject to the whims of \"brutal and unscrupulous\" masters, the workers were trapped in a situation mirroring the conditions of chattel slavery.",
            "Authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes.  The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of such methods in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" One notable technique involves juxtaposing adjectives and nouns that don't conventionally align, thereby creating a unique aura surrounding a subject. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them for similar effect.  He employs this latter technique extensively with colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. \n\nThroughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald constructs layers of meaning around colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to evoke specific feelings associated with pivotal objects.  \n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is that of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class, while gray signifies a sense of age and fading. This association is established early in the novel through frequent uses of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" (8); indeed, everyone appears to be adorned in white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he encounters Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instances where individuals are not wearing white occur when Nick is observing Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40).\n\nFitzgerald further solidifies these color meanings by applying them to commonplace, seemingly insignificant subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's partygoers appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable. Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary people or places in terms of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established sufficient meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This utilization of color symbolism to convey meaning begins with Daisy. After an extended period without significant use of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers consequently perceive Daisy as less of a distinct character and more as a uniform element, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy as a uniform addition through phrases like \"a gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural scene, fueled by its pleasant, sunny weather. Farmers cultivate a variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.  The demand for organic produce from locally sourced Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs is significant in the San Diego region, with numerous organizations experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also popular among consumers. Many organic farms have embraced additional revenue streams by offering tours of their operations, along with recreational activities like hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor pursuits. This type of model allows landowners to potentially benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat, creating recreational opportunities, and establishing avenues for educational programs or income generation. \n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially lucrative niche market, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in the surrounding plant and animal life. This is due to the absence of chemical inputs in the soil and water. However, organic farming does present some financial challenges compared to conventional methods. It often requires more hands-on labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as to fertilize the soil naturally.  Furthermore, losses due to pests and diseases can be higher with organic practices.  Smaller organic farms may also struggle to achieve the same economies of scale as larger operations.  Additional practices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also lead to increased labor costs. These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotation, managing invasive species, and actively shaping plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or patches of open ground.  These factors highlight the reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nOur case study focuses on a 160-acre parcel of land located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  The property is a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, an area covered by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan.  Although still under review, this plan encompasses over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.  Other species, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon face endangered status.\n\nThis area has a long history of human presence, initially inhabited by Native Americans for centuries.  Later, it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s.  This particular piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and/or timber production for many years.\n\nThe selection of this property was based on information gathered from a real estate website.  A thorough examination of available government programs was then conducted to assess the potential options for a small farmer seeking to mitigate costs while implementing wildlife-friendly practices. As a model for potential outcomes, an existing organic farm in the same area was identified and studied.",
            "Cultural nuances significantly influence the dynamics of any negotiation. Culture is a complex tapestry woven from both explicit and implicit threads, defying simplistic categorization. It is neither monolithic nor static, and generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify its multifaceted nature. While acknowledging broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a truly effective negotiator delves deeper, seeking to understand the specific cultural context of the negotiation and its potential impact on the interaction. \n\nWhen encountering a foreign culture, individuals inevitably draw comparisons to their own, leading to both insights and potential pitfalls.  Navigating cultural differences requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical understanding, awareness of cultural biases, and a willingness to embrace cultural diversity. Rather than imposing one's own cultural lens, it is crucial to approach unfamiliar cultures with respect and a genuine desire to understand their values and norms. This is especially vital when entering a negotiation with a weaker bargaining position, as cultural sensitivity can serve as a bridge over potential divides.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to recognize that cultural influences extend beyond national boundaries. Within any given nation, corporations often cultivate their own distinct cultures, shaping employee behavior and interaction. These corporate cultures manifest in various ways, from dress codes and communication styles to hiring practices and charitable initiatives. The spectrum of corporate cultures within a single nation, such as the United States, highlights the diversity of values and perspectives that can coexist within a shared cultural framework.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is paramount, as they provide the underlying motivations and beliefs that guide behavior. For instance, a culture that prioritizes \"saving face\" or communal harmony may discourage public displays of conflict or confrontation, while a culture that emphasizes individual achievement might prioritize a more aggressive negotiation style. Recognizing these underlying values can empower negotiators to tailor their approach and build rapport with counterparts from different cultural backgrounds. While general cultural insights are valuable, building a personal connection with the opposing party can further enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The statement, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible. This phrase serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God.  This belief, seemingly shared by another prominent theologian, Thomas Aquinas, forms the foundation for our comparative analysis.  Since both philosophers aim to defend the existence of the same God—specifically, the God described in the Bible—we will proceed on the assumption that both believe in this deity.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison as their arguments are tailored to a specific understanding.  While both Anselm and Aquinas present compelling points, neither, in my view, offers a completely comprehensive rationale for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's examine Anselm's central argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection in comprehending God. He posits that because God exists within our conceptual framework, we cannot truly conceive of his absence. Though his presentation, with its specific terminology, can be somewhat dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that proof of God's existence resides within the realm of our own minds.  Anselm suggests that we needn't rely on external evidence to find truth about God; rather, the existence of this being is inherently true within our own understanding. This reliance on concepts that lack irrefutable empirical evidence is often termed \"faith\" within Christian discourse.\n\nAquinas, however, diverges from Anselm's approach. He argues that the existence of God can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it could potentially attract new adherents without requiring them to accept something unprovable. Instead, they could be convinced through logical reasoning alone. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the existence of God is a logical necessity.  An analogy could be made to a missing puzzle piece: if you have assembled the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can infer the features and existence of the missing piece without having to actually see it.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, later known as Buddha, was born. His life journey led him to renounce worldly possessions and attain enlightenment, ultimately giving rise to Buddhism. The oldest and most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism, which has evolved significantly over its two and a half thousand years of existence.  This evolution is evident in various practices, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation. Both monks and lay followers participate in this ritual, though its origins are not directly linked to Buddha's teachings. These variations extend beyond surface-level customs to encompass the very essence of the religion, influencing both monastic and lay interpretations of Theravada Buddhist doctrine.\n\nThroughout history, the Theravada Buddhist community has navigated both internal and external influences, both positive and negative. To understand these forces, several key terms will be frequently employed. \"Internal\" refers to influences originating from individuals within the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. \"External\" refers to influences stemming from individuals outside of Buddhism. \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to damage or detract from the Buddhist community, often driven by misconceptions or prejudice. Conversely, \"benign\" forces, while not necessarily intending to help or harm, might inadvertently impact the community as a consequence of their actions. These terms will serve as a framework for analyzing the forces shaping Theravada Buddhism.\n\nA fundamental understanding of Theravada Buddhism requires exploring its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"triple gem\" – the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, the Buddhist scriptures divided into three baskets. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines monastic discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores Buddhist metaphysics. This metaphysical framework includes concepts like Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in existence), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these truths is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and achieving liberation from lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living, outlining five precepts for lay followers (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants). Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. Central to Buddhist thought is the Four Noble Truths: 1) Dukkha – life involves suffering; 2) attachment causes suffering; 3) suffering can be overcome; and 4) the path to overcome suffering is the Eightfold Path.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico provides a compelling case study of a prolonged rivalry, lasting from 1836 to 1893.  This period, marked by numerous conflicts, reached its peak with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, resulting in a significant territorial shift in favor of the United States. While numerous clashes occurred throughout this era, tensions finally subsided on the eve of World War I.\n\nAt its core, the rivalry stemmed from fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests. This pattern of rivalry between neighboring countries is not unique.  Shared borders often lead to friction and divergent viewpoints, as seen in the enduring tensions between the United States and Mexico.  Historian David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that \"Mexico and Cuba stand out as enduring diplomatic challenges for the United States\" (p. 41), highlighting the persistent nature of these relationships.  Geographically proximate and historically rivals, these nations contrast with others in Latin America who have enjoyed more amicable ties with the United States.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"while Americans in the twentieth century opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  This echoes the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, where ideological differences mingled with competition for strategic advantage.  In the case of the United States and Mexico, the ideological struggle centered around religious preferences, fueled by pre-existing mistrust stemming from the colonial eras.  The legacy of English-Spanish rivalry cast a long shadow on early diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period. The majority of these conflicts revolved around territorial issues, including border incursions and frontier skirmishes.  Banditry and lawlessness along the shared border remained a persistent problem until both nations implemented stricter border security measures (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States economically and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico towards the latter part of the nineteenth century (p. 109, 110).",
            "A life-altering event occurred fifteen years ago, thrusting me into a world of unexpected challenges.  The illness, previously unknown to me, abruptly ended my career as a nurse. While I had chosen nursing for its perceived stability, driven by a childhood yearning for security, my true aspirations lay elsewhere—in the realms of science and journalism.  Despite this, I found myself at forty-six, single, and facing a future without income or the ability to work.\n\nThe reality of disability, a constant companion for fifteen years, has stripped away my financial reserves, leaving me with a profound sense of vulnerability. Social Security Disability benefits provide a bare minimum, each day a struggle for financial stability and emotional well-being.  Uncertainty has become a defining characteristic of my life. \n\nHowever, amidst this adversity, a unwavering truth has emerged: I could not have persevered without the unwavering support of my family and a few steadfast friends.  Their compassion has been a lifeline, a testament to the human capacity for connection and care.\n\nLife is inherently unpredictable, rife with both minor and major upheavals.  While preparedness is essential, certain events transcend individual capabilities, demanding a collective response. \n\nWhile I agree that excessive reliance on government institutions is unwise, I believe fostering a spirit of mutual trust and interdependence is paramount.  Rather than isolating ourselves in self-reliance, we should cultivate a culture of support, where individuals feel empowered to seek and offer assistance.\n\nAmerican history is often romanticized as a story of rugged individualism, but the truth is more nuanced. Our forefathers' resilience stemmed not solely from self-reliance, but from compassion, mutual respect, and a willingness to share resources.  The pioneers who traversed the American West did not conquer the wilderness alone; their success was built on cooperation and community.\n\nTherefore, let us embrace preparedness while simultaneously nurturing a sense of interconnectedness.  I, for one, have taken steps to ensure my safety and well-being, stockpiling essential supplies and learning essential skills.  \n\nBut alongside these practical measures, let us not forget the importance of building strong relationships with our neighbors. Community is our bedrock, a source of strength and support when life inevitably throws curveballs.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the ways they do has long fascinated scientists. Are there inherent limitations or guiding forces that shape the course of evolutionary change? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that even the simplest organic forms remained elusive to precise mathematical description,  recent advancements in mathematical modeling offer new perspectives. Researchers have started applying these models to understand the broader aspects of mollusk shell development, both in terms of individual growth (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). This study investigates how combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in the genus *Prunum*, alongside experimental research, can shed light on the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes.\n\nUsing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantifiable anatomical parameters. These parameters were then incorporated into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to model both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. This allowed us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological variations within *Prunum*. The results of these models are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary trends within this group.\n\nThe structure of a shell can be conceptualized as a tube traversing through a three-dimensional space over time. These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis known as the columella.  The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the base being the opposite end. The aperture is an opening through which the animal extends from its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from different perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the observer and the apex points upwards.\n\nCounting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective, identifying the starting point of the first suture, and drawing a line dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are then counted from this line, with estimations made to the nearest quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be interpreted as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. By plotting the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with its horizontal and vertical radius, we can trace the path of the aperture. This trajectory can then be represented both visually and mathematically.\n\nOnce a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, allowing us to explore the factors influencing shell development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in neonatal and infant mortality over the last decade has been stagnant. Despite advancements in sectors like water and sanitation, aligning with Millennium Development Goals, child and maternal health improvements fall short of the necessary trajectory to meet the 2015 target.  Understanding the multifaceted reasons behind these shortcomings is crucial, suggesting a stronger emphasis on health system fortification rather than isolated programmatic interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has witnessed a positive shift in the proportion of births attended by skilled health professionals, reaching 72%, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners like midwives who lack the capacity to manage complicated pregnancies. Consequently, a significant portion of maternal deaths are attributed to hemorrhage, highlighting a misleading perception of progress.  Similarly, the decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases among children under five receiving professional treatment warrants concern. Data gaps exist regarding postnatal care, but existing information indicates a nationwide deficiency in this area.\n\nC-section rates remain below expectations at approximately 4%.  Furthermore, the disparity between urban (7%) and rural (2%) c-section rates underscores an equity issue in healthcare accessibility.  Urban areas appear to dominate access to healthcare services, while a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles points to a vertical equity challenge.  Financial barriers, likely driven by out-of-pocket costs, appear to hinder the poor's access to healthcare.\n\nMoving forward, improving neonatal and maternal care hinges on effectively addressing service gaps.  Should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, particularly pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children?\n\nProgrammatic solutions, while appealing due to their targeted objectives and faster results, present drawbacks.  Concentrating resources on a single health sector often neglects other areas, leading to a potential drain on human resources and funding.  Furthermore, multiple parallel programs risk service duplication and uncoordination, resulting in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its frequent exploration of the aristocratic class. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend, with works like \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" deviating from the established norms. Both novels introduce elements of mystery and the uncanny, characteristics less common in typical Victorian fiction. This distinctive approach strengthens the characters, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\": \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”  \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often utilize mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose of these moments vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, his vulnerabilities, and his perception of the events unfolding around him.  The shooting of Oliver, revisited vividly in chapter 28, serves as a powerful example. He relives the event as if in a dream while desperately seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the situation and his deteriorating physical condition, underscored by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" taking him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, leaving him with a constant, gnawing fear. The question arises: whose will is responsible for Oliver's misfortune? It is clearly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver lacks agency, unable to exert control even in the face of imminent danger. A sense of defeat pervades this experience, suggesting that Fagin's influence has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react.  \n\nAnother example of this dreamlike quality can be found in \"Wuthering Heights\": \n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with elementary students in an after-school program, providing academic support. While I could assist in various subjects, my expertise lay in English and reading.  I was approached by a teacher to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling significantly with reading. He seemed to have unusual difficulties. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were completely foreign to him; it was quite perplexing. \n\nAdrian, who I believe was in third or fourth grade, was of Latino heritage, but spoke English fluently. We faced challenges until I met his mother. While assisting with childcare for a few students who remained behind during a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived.  She communicated solely in Spanish, as her English was limited. My own Spanish skills were rudimentary at the time, but we managed to establish a basic understanding.\n\nThat's when a realization struck me: Adrian wasn't unable to read; he simply lacked a solid grasp of the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this insight ultimately proved beneficial, but I sincerely hope he's made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the significant issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It also demonstrates that challenges aren't always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can pose a considerable obstacle. This problem is undeniable, so what can we do to address it?\n\nIn Adrian's case, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring him in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English proficiency, the solutions are far more complex. There isn't a single, definitive answer. \n\nDual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes – none of these approaches alone offer a complete solution. The key lies in a multifaceted approach that incorporates all these elements. \n\nFirst and foremost, dual language programs are a valuable concept, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all students. Studies have shown that children in these programs often outperform their peers academically.\n\nDespite their merits, these programs face resistance, with concerns about resource allocation and the perceived lack of benefit for the majority of students. These fears are unfounded. If we implemented dual language programs more broadly, rather than as an exception, all students would reap the rewards.\n\nBut how do we achieve this?  Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical and unrealistic. However, I strongly believe that we can and should have bilingual support staff, such as tutors or aides, to assist in these programs.",
            "From youth, many of us are instilled with the understanding that there exists something beyond our grasp, something vast and enigmatic. Some seek answers in organized religion, be it Sunday school or temple, while others embark on a journey of introspection. Tradition often guides our beliefs, leading us to embrace the faiths of our parents. However, some reject these tenets entirely, clinging to the conviction that knowledge resides solely within the confines of their own personal experience. Our values may evolve, shifting and transforming over time. Regardless of the path we choose, we strive to define ourselves through our individual perspectives on spirituality, searching for a guiding light to illuminate our way through darkness and into the realm of understanding.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I questioned my father about his favorite bird. We sat on the porch, the steady drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop to our conversation. Our cigarettes burned between us as we watched water cascade down the gutters, drowning the plants lining the edge of the porch.  He gazed out at the rain, his eyes distant, as if lost in thought, perhaps retracing memories. His physique had become more fragile, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair, once thick, was now thin and sparse. He avoided my gaze, his eyes fixed on the relentless downpour.  A profound sense of isolation washed over me, a fear of confronting the inevitable truth, the reality that I would soon be without him.  To speak of it aloud would only solidify its existence, making it all too tangible.  I held him close, retreated to my chair, and pulled it closer to his, joining him in silent contemplation of the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nMy father's life ended in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, though they prolonged his suffering, failed to alleviate it.  He lingered for months beyond the doctors' predictions, but the value of those extra days remained elusive to me.  \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered to myself in the stillness of the night.  My prayers were absent, as if God had ceased to hear my pleas long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final passage, to see the life that had given birth to me fade away. So I chose not to be present.  I refused to watch the man who had shaped me, whose love had nurtured me, succumb to death.  I yearned to remember him through the vibrant tapestry of his life, not through the bleakness of his demise. I knew him better than anyone else, better even than his own family, and I was certain he wouldn't desire his only child to be a mere observer at his departure. For three days, I retreated into the sanctuary of my bed, a cocoon of grief, waiting for the news.\n\nSilence met my anticipation.  No one called.",
            "The \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt aptly points out in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" presents an intriguing paradox: it's simultaneously old and new.  This literary genre has been subject to a range of critical responses, from dismissals for its perceived lack of depth to celebrations of its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, skillfully blends elements from both ancient and modern romances, forging a novel mode of literary expression. Walpole ingeniously interweaves traditional theatrical elements with a contemporary focus on nature, as he himself describes in his preface (\"A Gothic Story,\" 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily upon medieval gothic theater, architecture, and cultural traditions. \n\nEven in the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, the term \"Gothic\" was already associated with a variety of cultures, styles, and historical periods. It often carried connotations of archaism or cultural primitivism when juxtaposed against the perceived advancements of the modern era. The unique convergence of the theatrical \"Gothic\" style with the novel's emerging format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, has contributed to the enduring appeal of Gothic literature.  It allows the genre to remain both timeless and strikingly contemporary for readers distanced from its origins.\n\nOne of the most prominent themes recurring in Gothic novels is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideals of knightly training and conduct are both preserved and reinterpreted in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers because it embodied ideals of courage, honor, and competence—qualities they often saw as lacking in contemporary society, particularly figures like Walpole himself. By employing chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and used as a means to critique and potentially improve the present.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of political turmoil and personal accusations, may have harbored anxieties about the future.  This context may have led him to reflect, perhaps unconsciously, on the perceived moral and inherent goodness of individuals during the \"Gothic\" era, contrasting it with the perceived failings of his own time. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic.  Even before his introduction, the reader is presented with descriptions that highlight his chivalric traits:\n\n[Insert the original description of Frederic here]\n\n\nThe depiction of Frederic is infused with traditional chivalric imagery. He is, first and foremost, a prince who has endured suffering, been deeply affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by enemies. This portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous knight\" is, of course, heightened, introducing the soon-to-be-canonical Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The intricate network of processes involved in getting products from a customer's order to their doorstep is known as supply chain management.  Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this concept encompasses the comprehensive planning, execution, and oversight of every stage, from raw materials to finished goods, with the ultimate goal of fulfilling customer needs swiftly and efficiently.  Six key elements underpin this complex system: production, supply, inventory management, location optimization, transportation logistics, and information flow. By skillfully managing these elements, businesses strive to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain. It defines the \"who, what, when, and where\" of manufacturing, ensuring alignment with customer demand.  Market analysis plays a crucial role in understanding these demands, guiding decisions about product development and production volume. Once production plans are established, the next step involves determining the optimal location for manufacturing, considering factors like production capacity, quality standards, and proximity to both suppliers and customers.  \n\nFollowing location selection, managers focus on meticulous scheduling and equipment maintenance to ensure smooth and efficient production.  Every detail in this stage is critical, as even minor oversights can lead to significant time and financial losses down the line.  Illustrating this point, my experience working at retail giants like Walmart and Target highlighted the importance of standardized processes. From employee attire to receiving shipments, meticulously documented procedures ensured clarity and consistency, enabling these massive organizations to operate seamlessly.\n\nThe next vital element is supply, encompassing strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.  A company might have multiple production divisions specializing in various aspects of a single product. Managers must carefully allocate production tasks to the most suitable division based on its equipment, workforce, and expertise. \n\nFurthermore, outsourcing specific processes can be a strategic advantage, allowing companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality products flexibly while minimizing costs.",
            "On a bustling city corner, Ellen Page, renowned for her role in the film \"Juno,\" stood alone, a hand-held sign held aloft.  The stark message, scrawled in black marker, declared: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a powerful military junta that seized control in 1962 through a coup.  The year 2007 witnessed a surge in public demonstrations, the first in a decade.  These protests, led primarily by Buddhist monks clad in saffron-colored robes, came to be known as the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government permitted these peaceful gatherings, but tensions escalated rapidly, culminating in what some described as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military.  Monasteries were raided, and foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned. Tragically, Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, lost his life on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a protest. While official reports cite 13 deaths, a defected army colonel, Hla Win, claimed that the true number of casualties was significantly higher, potentially reaching several thousand.\n\nThis pattern of brutality is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have sought to silence dissent and maintain absolute power. Ancient Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, divinely ordained to govern every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors were revered as gods, credited with guiding their people towards prosperity through technological innovation and the ritual of seppuku.  Even contemporary political figures, such as former U.S. President George W. Bush, have been associated with controversial figures and organizations.\n\nHistory provides numerous stark reminders of the dangers of unchecked power. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where intellectuals, activists, and students gathered to demand democratic reforms, resulted in a violent crackdown. The official death toll remains disputed, with estimates ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s witnessed the systematic extermination of Tutsis and political moderates by Hutu militias, backed by the government.  And the Holocaust, perpetrated by Nazi Germany during World War II, stands as a horrifying testament to the consequences of racial hatred and intolerance.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz landscape is largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his keen ability to mold his orchestra. While his piano presence often takes a subtle role in the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his creation of intricate and multifaceted pieces that allowed his band members to showcase their individual talents. He meticulously constructed frameworks that encouraged improvisation while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and phrases tailored to the unique styles of each musician, thereby highlighting specific musical ideas. This approach also served to shape the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in coherent and distinctive sonic textures that complemented each composition. Ellington's masterful grasp of both the individual players' sounds and their collective synergy enabled him to produce some of the most innovative and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's sonic innovations, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his lifelong practice of utilizing voice \"as a jazz instrument.\" This early composition demonstrates Ellington's ability to incorporate voice as a textural and timbral element without relying on conventional lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also exemplifies his talent for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues structure unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between voice and reeds, where the vocal line commences smoothly and melodically, gradually transitioning to a more rugged sound towards its conclusion.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that embellishes the basic melody while emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. This time, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, taking on a more instrumental role as a soloist.\n\nTag: A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, unconventional ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice to enhance the tonal color of this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that permeates his entire oeuvre. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly blends his mastery of tight orchestration with his keen ear for tonal nuance. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice, creating a rich and harmonious sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further extends these ideas, as Ellington brilliantly utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "A persistent yearning had always resided within her. This unexplainable need, a void begging to be filled, first emerged during her adolescence, at the tender age of fourteen. Three years later, at seventeen, the longing persisted.  While she had begun to realize she craved connection, specifically with a person rather than a material object, no one captured her interest. Despite the advances of several boys, who awkwardly attempted to woo her with little success, she remained unaffected. This peculiarity led to much introspection, causing her to ponder the reasons behind her lack of romantic inclination. Years of contemplation had yielded various theories, but none that truly satisfied her search for an explanation.  \n\nLife unfolded, punctuated by her persistent questioning of desires that seemed to defy societal norms. \n\nHer daily existence was typically serene.  Her parents, individuals of remarkable tranquility, rarely engaged in conflict, and disagreements with their daughter were equally uncommon. Their sole point of contention was her assertion of independence and her vibrant personality, which, while charming and endearing, sometimes clashed with their more subdued natures.\n\nHowever, today's tranquility was shattered. As she moved through the house in search of inspiration, a sharp cry echoed from the kitchen, her mother's voice laced with pain.  Panic surged within her as she rushed to the source of the sound, her voice trembling with concern, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" \n\nThere she found her mother lying on the floor, visibly distressed, her words punctuated by gasps of pain.  Rushing to her side, her daughter offered comfort. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were strained and whispered, revealing the intensity of her suffering.\n\n\"Okay, Mom,\" she replied, her voice firm despite her own rising anxiety. \"Just tell me where to pick you up.\" Following her mother's instructions, she swiftly carried her to the car, carefully laying her in the back seat.  \n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital mingled with the undercurrent of fear, but her focus remained solely on her mother's well-being.  She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical assistance as she went.  Concerned faces gathered around, and a rolling bed was quickly brought to her mother's side. They whisked her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to wait, consumed by worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the connection between following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\"  and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a tailored version of the Med diet, characterized by a focus on plant-based foods, including protein sources like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while excluding potatoes. It emphasizes monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and includes fish, with reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted within this dietary pattern.\n\nPrevious studies had shown a link between adherence to a Med diet and a decreased risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. In fact, a trial found that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels (specifically, lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). However, these prior studies did not specifically examine the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states.  Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each woman six times, using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess their dietary intake from the previous year.  Remarkably, over 95% of the nurses remained involved in the study throughout this entire 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies to ensure their accuracy.  Information about CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke cases was confirmed through review of medical records, hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, though this applied to about 17% of all stroke cases and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.  For each FFQ, researchers calculated body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Starting in 1986, they also assessed leisure-time physical activity.\n\nTo minimize random variation for each individual and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary habits, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. These averages combined scores from the two preceding years. To account for potential confounding factors (variables that could influence the results), adjustments were made for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. Separate models were used to analyze fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe findings revealed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a greater aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of developing both CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes) were observed. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a significant downturn for the United States economy, characterized by a severe financial crisis.  Unemployment rates climbed, the housing market experienced a substantial decline, and numerous prominent corporations faced substantial challenges. This economic instability has persisted, prompting a critical examination of its origins and potential solutions.  \n\nA key contributing factor to this crisis was a combination of political decisions and insufficient oversight within the financial sector.  Pressure exerted on banks and lending institutions led to the widespread issuance of sub-prime loans, further exacerbated by an immature and inadequately regulated financial infrastructure. \n\nSimultaneously, government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were encouraged to package these mortgages into complex financial instruments known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, the financial system experienced a ripple effect, as banks faced depleted capital reserves and transferred the resulting losses onto these repackaged mortgages and, consequently, the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the late 1990s, during President Clinton's second term. In an effort to secure re-election, the administration implemented policies aimed at expanding homeownership, including relaxing lending standards. This move, while seemingly beneficial at the time, ultimately created a foundation for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded years later.  Journalists and analysts, such as Steven Holmes of the New York Times, raised concerns about the potential consequences of these relaxed regulations, predicting a scenario similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nThe complexity of modern mortgage products, including adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs, further contributed to the crisis. These intricate financial instruments interconnected various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial institutions.  \n\nWhen the housing bubble finally burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses.  Major investment banks, collectively holding an estimated $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, faced severe consequences. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at discounted prices, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to restructure as commercial banks under stricter regulatory oversight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with approximately $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, that stage in a narrative where authors attempt to convey backstory and world-building, can be a double-edged sword. While it offers the chance to paint a vivid picture for the reader, it also walks a tightrope between enriching the story and overwhelming it with unnecessary information.  \n\nExperienced writers understand the importance of \"showing, not telling,\" yet even they can sometimes fall prey to lengthy exposition dumps. These moments, where narrative momentum stalls and information feels forced, can leave readers disengaged and longing for the story to progress. \n\nThink of exposition as a bridge between the known and the unknown. It sets the scene, introduces characters, and establishes the context for the unfolding events. However, this bridge should be traversed efficiently and organically, seamlessly woven into the narrative fabric.\n\nConsider a scenario where a story informs the reader about a central character's past love and subsequent tragedy.  Instead of simply stating that the heroine met her beloved, married them, and then witnessed their untimely demise, a skilled writer would delve deeper. They would reveal the depth of their love through dialogue, interactions, and subtle details that showcase their bond. \n\nFor instance, we might see glimpses of the husband's devotion in his actions, his words, and his mannerisms.  Similarly, the heroine's character could be illuminated through her reactions to him, her memories, and her reflections on their shared experiences.  This approach not only provides a richer understanding of the characters but also creates an emotional connection with the reader, making their grief and loss more poignant.\n\nUltimately, the goal of exposition is to inform and engage without interrupting the flow of the story. It's about providing the necessary context while allowing the narrative to breathe and evolve organically.",
            "I observed two news broadcasts originating from Columbus, Ohio on August 13, 2011. My first viewing was of NBC 4's live morning broadcast. The lead story focused on a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot displayed. The report, lasting approximately two minutes, indicated multiple stab wounds and his subsequent arrest. The brevity seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe subsequent segment addressed the early morning shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Critically injured, he remained unidentified by authorities at the time. The SWAT Team was engaged in the investigation. This story felt comparatively brief, leading me to speculate whether the brevity stemmed from the victim's race or the location of the incident. A recurring observation of mine is the underrepresentation of minority victims in media coverage. It appears that cases involving white victims often receive significantly more attention, be it kidnappings, disappearances, or other crimes. \n\nFurther coverage included a report on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. The incident site and the determination of a .22 caliber rifle being the source of the projectile were detailed. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension.\n\nA brief segment followed, focusing on the anticipated rain and thunderstorms for the upcoming weekend, with temperatures predicted to remain in the mid-to-low eighties. This seemingly concise report served as a \"teaser\" to encourage viewer engagement. \n\nAnother story involved a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I noted an emphasis on the suspect's race and complexion, which seemed disproportionate to the narrative.\n\nFinally, the broadcast covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, sentenced to 300 months for conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. The unusual phrasing of his sentence, instead of stating the typical 25 years, struck me as peculiar. The mention of Rodriguez's Hispanic ethnicity also seemed tangential to the core story.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, an unyielding and everlasting tie. Within this bond reside a multitude of emotions: affection, admiration, envy, and even ruthlessness, to name a few. Brothers possess an understanding that transcends ordinary relationships, a profound insight into one another's souls. In their reflections, they see not just an image, but a mirror reflecting their truest selves. When faced with adversity, the essence of this bond is revealed, manifesting either in acts of extraordinary compassion or unspeakable darkness. These emotions, when laid bare, carry a weighty consequence.  Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal link necessitates confronting the repercussions they inevitably bring. When one can gaze into a brother's eyes and perceive their own reflection staring back, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they truly are. The essence of their character lies not in their intentions, but in the actions they take and the consequences that follow. In the narrative \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers embark on a journey exploring this intricate theme, delving into the tempestuous emotions that accompany it.  \n\nSet against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered landscapes, these two young boys set off on a journey destined for futility.  A palpable clash of bitter disappointment and fervent pride erupts in the narrative's climax, leaving only one brother to emerge from the ordeal alive. This central theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which illuminates the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world around him—influences that profoundly shape his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be distilled to a singular, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial forays together to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors a sense of resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother with whom he could share his worldly knowledge, someone who could keep pace with him in activities such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desired a companion who could join him in adventures like \"racing to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\"  These aspirations, however, are dashed against the reality of Doodle's condition.  Born with a frail heart, Doodle's survival was precarious, and participation in vigorous physical activity seemed an impossibility. For the young protagonist, whose mind brimmed with boundless energy and imagination, this realization was a devastating blow. His dreams were shattered, leaving him consumed by disappointment.  Indeed, his resentment towards the younger child manifests in a chilling thought: contemplating infanticide by smothering him with a pillow. Such a thought, born of frustration and despair, speaks volumes about the protagonist's internal struggles. Yet, a glimmer of his innate love for his brother surfaces when the child offers a simple smile. This small gesture instills a flicker of hope in the protagonist's heart, suggesting that his dark inclination was perhaps not as deeply rooted as he initially believed.",
            "The intricate workings of the human brain, a marvel of biological engineering, have long fascinated thinkers and scientists alike. As our understanding of this complex system has evolved, so too have the analogies used to describe its functions. From ancient comparisons to the malleability of wax tablets to the structured organization of papyrus scrolls, and later to the computational power of modern computers, each metaphor sheds light on certain aspects of the brain's workings while ultimately falling short of capturing its full complexity.\n\nThe process of information acquisition begins with sensory input, where specialized receptors translate external stimuli, such as tactile sensations, temperature variations, sound waves, or light particles, into electrochemical signals. These signals then undergo a series of transformations within the intricate neural networks of the brain, guided by both bottom-up and top-down processing mechanisms. Consider, for instance, the perception of a simple image: a black square against a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes individual elements, such as color, shape, and spatial relationships, gradually assembling these pieces into a coherent whole – the recognition of a square. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages existing knowledge and expectations to expedite this recognition, allowing us to swiftly identify the object as a square rather than, say, a void within the white space.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an intricate attentional filter comes into play, selectively prioritizing certain signals based on their perceived significance. This filter, akin to a gatekeeper, ensures that our cognitive resources are allocated efficiently. For example, while our visual system may register every blade of grass beneath our feet, our attentional filter prevents us from consciously perceiving each individual blade, allowing us to focus on more salient stimuli. Conversely, our name, even amidst a cacophony of sounds, will readily capture our attention. This interplay between processing stages and attentional modulation is a fundamental aspect of how the brain orchestrates our perception and understanding of the world.\n\nTo effectively process information, the brain relies on sophisticated memory systems. These systems, which include sensory, working, and long-term memory, enable us to encode, store, and retrieve information over varying durations. Encoding, the initial stage of information storage, involves transforming sensory input into a format that can be stored in the brain. Different types of sensory stimuli may be encoded in distinct ways. For instance, verbal information can be encoded structurally (based on the visual appearance of the word), phonemically (based on its sound), or semantically (based on its meaning). Once encoded, information is maintained within different memory stores. Working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, is thought to be maintained through a continuous loop of electrical signals circulating through specific neuronal pathways. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be encoded within the intricate structures of proteins.\n\n\nThe organization of knowledge within the brain remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Several models have been proposed, drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model, the semantic network model, posits that concepts are represented as nodes, and these nodes are interconnected based on their semantic relationships. For example, the concept of \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" creating a network of interconnected ideas.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" presents a chilling vision of a future where technological advancement and a rigid capitalist system intertwine to create a dystopian society. In this world, the emphasis on communal harmony overshadows individual expression, and citizens are meticulously conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else.  They exist as cogs in a vast machinery, their thoughts and actions meticulously controlled by the World Controller, who enforces a singular, unquestioned ideology.  Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's profound unease regarding the trajectory of these very systems.\n\nTerms like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist theory, resonate throughout the novel, suggesting that Huxley viewed the burgeoning economic landscape of his time with both fascination and trepidation. He satirizes capitalism through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class, preoccupied with their own immediate needs, remains blind to the true power dynamics at play. This ideological manipulation, reminiscent of the control exerted over the proletariat in Marxist thought, is evident in the conditioning of the World State's citizens. The lower castes, designated as Delta, Gamma, and others, lack independent volition. Their desires are relentlessly shaped through \"hypnopædia,\" a form of sleep-learning,  to fuel a relentless cycle of consumption and spending. This manipulation, orchestrated by the World Controller, highlights the insidious nature of hegemony, a system where a dominant group exerts control over subordinate classes. The lower castes remain blissfully unaware of this manipulation, unwittingly perpetuating the very system that keeps them subjugated. While the upper classes, such as the Alphas and Betas, possess the capacity for awareness, they largely remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions without question.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in \"Brave New World\" are strangely sterile, lacking the depth and complexity that mark genuine human connection. Their interactions are superficial, often reduced to superficial observations about physical appearance or fleeting encounters. This absence of genuine emotional bonds underscores Huxley's chilling suggestion that the relentless march of technology and unchecked capitalism may ultimately strip humanity of its capacity for love, empathy, and meaningful expression. The characters themselves seem interchangeable, further emphasizing the dehumanizing effects of this engineered society.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned approximately two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus, a challenge faced by many, including myself, has been a recurring topic of discussion. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the sprawling campus, excluding, of course, the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my residence to classes held in distant locations like Willard building, closer to the heart of campus, frequently involved a trek of up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when inclement weather – a frequent occurrence in State College – presented obstacles. Through conversations with an alum, not significantly older than myself, I learned that the East Halls dormitories were once isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of undeveloped land. Today, this once-vacant space has undergone a remarkable transformation, now accommodating sports fields, substantial new constructions such as the modern Creamery and the recently erected health services building, and a ring of residential apartments. As our campus continues to expand, the task of traversing this increasingly complex landscape becomes progressively more demanding.\n\nA pressing question arises: what constitutes the most effective solution to this mobility challenge? For a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a strong contender. However, the bicycle alone cannot provide a complete answer. Student adoption is crucial, and the campus infrastructure must be thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of cyclists.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had reintroduced cycling into their life after a multi-year hiatus revealed their astonishment at ever having abandoned this mode of transportation. \"Bikes are truly exceptional,\" they remarked, \"during a period when cycling wasn't considered fashionable, it remained the most practical means of getting around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling boasts remarkable efficiency. A modest breakfast of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel you for 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, located a comparable distance from the campus center as certain dormitories.  The most astute decision I have made this year was the acquisition of a bicycle. Daily, I attend classes in Thomas building, a location easily a 25-minute walk from my residence. Cycling can significantly reduce this travel time to a mere 5 minutes, provided a brisk pace is maintained.\n\nUnfortunately, Pollock Road, the most direct route from my home to Thomas building, presents challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists. While walking offers its merits, my current schedule leaves little room for extended walks. In the absence of my bicycle, walking would be my only dependable option for reaching classes. A daily trek to Thomas on foot would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours each week. Accounting for the time required to walk to and from other classes, appointments, and various other commitments, this additional walking time would be unsustainable."
