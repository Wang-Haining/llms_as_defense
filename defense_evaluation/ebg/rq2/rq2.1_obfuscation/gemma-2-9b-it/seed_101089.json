            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My aspiration to pursue a career in social work stems from a deep desire to contribute to the well-being of children who have endured abuse or neglect. I envision myself working within the Division of Family and Children Services, offering support to both vulnerable children and families grappling with challenges.  \n\nThe field of social work resonates deeply with my personal values: service, respect, ethical conduct, and a steadfast commitment to fostering positive relationships.  I believe these principles extend beyond the professional realm and are fundamental to living a meaningful life.\n\nMy journey toward this calling began with a lifelong inclination toward helping others.  During my academic years, I observed individuals grappling with adversity in various ways, some resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences fueled my initial pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009.  \n\nA pivotal moment occurred during a summer visit with a friend. I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment.  Witnessing his plight ignited a profound desire within me to make a tangible difference. Though the legal system was unable to intervene directly, I felt compelled to offer support. My background in psychology led me to engage with the boy's parents, attempting to understand their perspective and advocate for the child's well-being. This experience solidified my conviction that a career in social work would allow me to directly address the complex needs of children and families.\n\nAnother core value that drives my passion for social work is social justice.  I believe in the inherent worth of every individual and challenge societal norms that perpetuate inequality.  I have consistently advocated for social justice throughout my life, whether through personal expression, activism, or standing up against discrimination.  This commitment will continue to guide my work in social work.",
            "This exploration delves into the theoretical frameworks of biological and sociocultural models, examining their application to the complex sleep disorder, insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on the influence of inherited genetic predispositions and physiological health factors on sleep patterns. Conversely, the sociocultural model investigates the impact of environmental influences, considering variables such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic standing.  This analysis critically reviews pertinent research within each model, elucidating the strengths and limitations of each study's findings.\n\nSleep disorders can manifest in various forms: primary sleep disorders, those secondary to other mental health conditions, or those arising from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders are categorized as either Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass a range of conditions like insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias. These conditions primarily affect the initiation and maintenance of sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities or physiological events during sleep, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and unspecified parasomnias. Sleep disorders linked to mental health often stem from Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, providing a comparative analysis of its relationship to both the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model posits that genes, inherited traits, and physiological factors contribute to the development of sleep disorders. Notably, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness.  A study utilizing mice models demonstrated the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically implicated in sleep-wake cycles. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition reduces anxiety and induces sleep.  Administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) resulted in increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009).  These findings suggest that findings from animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  \n\nPotential dysfunction or absence of this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, possibly necessitating medication for adequate rest. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited variations in this receptor phenotype could influence sleep regulation.  Alterations in receptor function could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting various aspects of life such as academic performance, career success, and daily tasks requiring sustained attention and focus.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is elucidated, outlining common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the document concludes with strategies that educators in inclusive classroom settings can implement to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's effectiveness in utilizing auditory information. In essence, CAPD involves the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process sound input and the neurological activity underlying this process (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This signifies that individuals with CAPD may experience difficulties in accurately interpreting sounds despite possessing normal hearing abilities. The brain's region responsible for deciphering speech, distinguishing words, and segregating conversations from background noise may not function optimally.\n\nThe earliest documented instances of the condition, initially termed \"auditory imperception,\" emerged in the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers investigating children with communicative disorders were among the first to observe these auditory processing challenges. In 1954, an Italian research team composed of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of tests for children exhibiting these difficulties. Subsequently, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 further fueled research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways. Individuals with CAPD may struggle with sound localization, auditory discrimination, pattern recognition, and speech comprehension. They might have difficulty distinguishing between sounds, perceiving changes in speech intonation (e.g., sarcasm), or processing sequential auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves thorough observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and psychologists. These assessments may encompass questionnaires, behavioral observations, and specialized tests that evaluate various auditory-related skills. Notably, there is currently no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool, and the underlying cause of CAPD remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and require them to identify specific sounds or sequences. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and analyzing the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex nature of disguise and its implications for self-discovery and interpersonal relationships. While acknowledging the potential for deception to be effective in the short term, the play ultimately suggests that individuals must confront their assumed identities to avoid becoming lost in the act of pretense.  However, revealing the truth can lead to alienation and strained connections.\n\nThe play presents a compelling dilemma: choosing between preserving one's authentic self and safeguarding existing relationships. Some might react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, while others may harbor resentment and offense, further complicating matters.\n\nGender role reversal within the context of deception adds another layer of complexity.  A crucial question emerges: why would someone feel compelled to abandon their own identity and adopt the guise of the opposite gender?  In Viola's case, her decision stems from a need for self-preservation.  Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, she adopts the male persona of Cesario as a protective measure against potential threats: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nWhile her disguise proves effective, it simultaneously isolates her from the female community, depriving her of a vital support network.  Furthermore, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads Olivia to misidentify her as Sebastian and develop romantic feelings: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138).  Adding to the complexity, Viola grapples with suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nDespite its potentially progressive elements, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on how deception can illuminate hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's assumed identity. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario driven by his perceived masculinity, or does it reflect a deeper, perhaps unconscious, inclination towards women?  \n\nIt's plausible that Olivia's character serves as a satire of those in Shakespeare's era who judge individuals solely based on appearances, as evidenced by her swift transition of affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her subsequent shift in perception of Cesario/Viola to one of familial regard: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule across its various territories has been subject to criticism, particularly concerning its actions in German South West Africa, where the Ovaherero and Nama people suffered a horrific genocide. However, it would be reductive to solely define the German colonial enterprise through such a lens.  The empire displayed a remarkable diversity in its governing strategies and policies, mirroring the vast geographical spread of its possessions. \n\nEducational initiatives undertaken within the colonies also demonstrated this variability. When Britain assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanzania) in 1919, they encountered a populace with a significant number of educated and literate individuals.  German educational endeavors in other colonies, such as Kamerun, were lauded by contemporary writers.\n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government actively established state schools and played a central role in educating the native population, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  Despite this, the government did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing state schools and providing substantial backing and oversight for missionary educational institutions.  These contrasting educational policies had enduring consequences for South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by formal education, with the vast majority of the population remaining illiterate.\n\nVarious social, political, and economic factors converged to create this divergent experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native African population, drawing upon recent research in this area.\n\nExisting scholarship on education within the German colonial empire is extensive.  Most of these sources, primarily originating from the early twentieth century, were written in German and focus on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the colonies. Later works, predominantly in English, have expanded this discourse through comparative analyses of education across the various German colonies and in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies have highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies.\n\nThe seminal work directly addressing the subject of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and explores the factors contributing to their differences.  Cohen posits that the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining many of the unique characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, though much of its territory is characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has become incredibly intricate, encompassing a vast array of genres that are practically impossible to completely list. This complexity is further amplified by the fact that most, if not all, genres – encompassing styles like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk – have branched out into numerous subgenres and even sub-subgenres.\n\nWithin this expansive landscape, heavy metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the last forty years. Its expressiveness stems from its capacity to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though these often gravitate towards the darker end.  The genre's diversity is equally remarkable, as soon after its inception, artists began recognizing its inherent flexibility and began experimenting, giving rise to subgenres, which in turn spawned their own sub-subgenres, and so on, creating a continuous chain of evolution.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement finds itself at a point where its numerous niches make it challenging to definitively define what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from a multitude of other genres, yet, like any significant cultural phenomenon, it originated from a specific source. To truly comprehend the diverse tapestry of heavy metal music that permeates the contemporary scene, one must first delve into the origins of the movement itself, understanding its essence as a cultural force rather than merely a musical genre.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement deeply rooted in the exploration of darkness. It can be characterized as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. In contrast to earlier, more primitive forms, metal emphasizes technical proficiency; musicians in metal bands demonstrate exceptional skill and command over their instruments, a virtuosity that resonates throughout their music. Moreover, it's undeniable that metal has a strong connection to the influence of drugs. The psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s fueled a wave of experimentation, leading to the creation of unconventional and otherworldly music, often using drugs as a catalyst for artistic expression. \n\nIts dark, visceral qualities were groundbreaking in the music scene, as much of popular music at the time lacked a strong connection to the darker aspects of the human emotional experience. Later generations of metal musicians have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral aesthetics prevalent in the Romantic era. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this darkness: \n\n\"Helter Skelter\" showcases a darker side to the Beatles, with its chaotic and seemingly drug-induced imagery. This song is often cited as one of the earliest examples of heavy metal, serving as a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones track.  The Beatles sought to demonstrate their own capacity for intensity, including this song on their iconic \"The White Album.\"",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealism, a singular artist named Henri Rousseau was painstakingly constructing his own imaginative worlds, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\"  depicts not only a woman awestruck by the wonders of her dream-induced landscape but also reflects Rousseau's own aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts.  However, this ambition presented him with a profound internal conflict: should he conform to prevailing painting styles to gain acceptance within the art world he deeply revered, or should he embrace creative independence and forge his own unique path? \"The Dream\" stands as a powerful testament to this lifelong struggle, encapsulating Rousseau's internal battle between conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully comprehend the layered meaning of \"The Dream,\" one must first delve into Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau's upbringing was far removed from the world of artistic refinement. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, enjoyed a comfortable middle-class existence. Formal art training eluded Rousseau, who spent forty years working for the French government as a toll collector, despite being mistakenly labeled a customs inspector. The profound loss of his wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with a single daughter, Julia, and an overwhelming sense of grief.  In search of solace and renewal, Rousseau turned to painting as a means of finding comfort and embarking on a fresh chapter in his life. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the hopes and dreams of the ordinary working class.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for recognition within the art world can be understood in light of his unique circumstances.  He lacked formal training and began his artistic career relatively late in life, navigating a landscape dominated by established and celebrated artists.  While he had been painting for years, his work only gained significant attention around the time Matisse began making a name for himself. According to art historian Jan Gordon, despite being artistic competitors, Rousseau and Matisse differed not only in style and subject matter, but also in their motivations. Gordon states that while Matisse sought to avoid painting in a predictable or clichéd manner, Rousseau's ambition was to create such a conventional work that he would be admitted to the prestigious Artiste Français society (92).",
            "Throughout history, many influential thinkers have explored the profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental link between truth and beauty. This relationship resonates deeply, as poet John Keats eloquently expresses in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  While much of our understanding of the world stems from formal education or personal experiences, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics appears to transcend these conventional learning methods. Both disciplines, as Keats implies, function more as descriptions than prescriptive guides. Our investigations into morality and beauty primarily aim to decipher why a particular artwork or literary piece holds aesthetic value or why a certain action is deemed ethical, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral conduct.\n\nFurthermore, any critique of art or morality inevitably falls short of capturing the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty. For instance, a discussion about the merits of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might delve into elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context. However, these analytical tools ultimately fail to fully elucidate the reasons behind its artistic brilliance. When individuals are asked about their favorite works of art or literature, they often preface their explanations with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" highlighting an elusive quality that transcends mere description.\n\nI believe that both art and morality possess an inherent characteristic that cannot be entirely reduced to a catalog of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor aptly stated, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we dissect the components of a literary work, a transcendent element remains, a \"je ne sais quoi\" that defies complete articulation.\n\nThis intangible essence, I propose, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. It is this very quality that links them, as Wittgenstein suggests, stating: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"  \n\nI posit that this shared transcendental nature forms a crucial connection between ethics and aesthetics.\n\nMorality and art intertwine profoundly because we experience them most powerfully on a noumenal level, a concept borrowed from Kant's philosophy. They evoke an impact that can be felt but not fully comprehended through rational analysis. This connection becomes even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Contemporary Germany stands as a powerful nation, united and characterized by a distinct culture that stretches from the Bavarian Alps in München to the Baltic Sea port city of Kiel. This cultural tapestry is evident from Köln, situated along the Rhine River, to the heart of the country and the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled on the Elbe. Given this rich and varied cultural heritage, it is not surprising that modern Germany evolved from a confluence of diverse tribes and origins.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people is known as Germania. The etymology of this name remains a subject of debate among historians and scholars. The Roman historian Tacitus asserted that the name derived from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who, prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls, were known by a different name. (Tacitus, 98) Julius Caesar, in his writings on the Gallic Wars, was the first to employ the term \"Germanus.\" In his account of his campaigns against the Gauls and his encounters with Germanic tribes frequently crossing the Rhine, Caesar adopted the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those who remained unconquered. Some scholars suggest that the term \"Germanus\" originated from a neighboring people in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of the first book of his Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)  Alternatively, others propose that the name derives from the spear used in Germanic warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" which might allude to the perceived loud and boisterous nature of the Germans. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" which delves into the origins of the Germans, wrote: \"I should regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave the Roman heartland for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not at that time, at least. They ventured into the lands of Germania for trade and occasionally launched military campaigns, but ultimately, they primarily returned to their vast empire. Consequently, as Germanic tribes emerged in the middle of the first century AD, they resided on the periphery of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods derived from their lands and offering their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army.

            "My gaze drifted downward, my thoughts a silent, unmoving sea. I observed the scene before me with a detached focus, analyzing each detail without allowing it to truly register. Ideas flickered in and out of my consciousness, fleeting and inconsequential. My mind operated with a mechanical precision, devoid of genuine emotion or reflection.\n\nYears ago, inspired by an artist I once collaborated with, I bought a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" The desire to draw had been with me since childhood, and this book promised to unlock the secrets of artistic perception. It delved into the intricate ways our brains interpret lines and shapes, even suggesting techniques like framing a picture within an imaginary square to simplify complex compositions.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at the object before me, I couldn't summon the artist's perspective. Overwhelmed by its presence, I could only stand and absorb its essence. Artistic giants like Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters had all found their signature styles: a blue phase, a love for greens, a riot of colors.  This, I thought, was my beginning, the genesis of my own artistic journey. I envisioned a piece titled \"Work in Brown,\" a testament to the raw, unfiltered experience before me.\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for my chosen tool, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, guided by an intangible internal force. This could be the dawn of creation, the birth of something truly unique. Water swirled serenely, a crystal-clear mirror reflecting the world around it. Fragments detached, carried away on the current.\n\nBut the moment shattered. My hand, now trembling with a nervous energy, slammed the toilet handle again. The stubborn object remained, stubbornly clinging to the porcelain.\n\nMy grip tightened on the mop, my feet planted firmly on the ground. A green tie felt like a noose around my neck. I frowned, my gaze fixed on the unwelcome deposit someone had left behind. A message, perhaps, for those who cleaned these public spaces. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand moved towards the wall, reaching for the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand, transforming it into a makeshift mitt.\n\nWith a final, decisive movement, I plunged my hand into the bowl, mimicking the gesture of a mother tending to a roast in the oven.",
            "Young individuals are facing a dangerous reality behind the wheel.  Several converging factors contribute to the alarming statistic of fatalities among the youngest drivers.  Research from the National Institutes of Health highlights that the adolescent brain is not fully developed for the complexities of driving.  Inexperience, a fundamental element in this issue, not only leads to a higher frequency of fatal accidents but also increases the likelihood of rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road.  \n\nFurthermore, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly amplifies these risks. Studies conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, for example, demonstrate a direct correlation between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.  \n\nIn an effort to mitigate these dangers, some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing programs for teenagers. These programs restrict driving hours and prohibit younger passengers. However, in my view, these measures are merely temporary solutions.  The core problem lies in the fact that, statistically, young drivers, as a group, lack the maturity and capabilities to adequately handle the inherent risks and responsibilities of operating a motor vehicle.  Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, a renowned psychologist, even argues that the age of 18 is too young for a full driver's license. His research suggests that individuals under the age of 19-20 possess a heightened inclination towards risk-taking behavior driven by a desire for thrills.  Therefore, delaying driving until this impulsive tendency diminishes seems prudent. \n\nFailure to address this issue will undoubtedly result in continued tragedies on our roads, with the potential for a catastrophic increase in fatalities in the coming years.  As the \"Millennials,\" the children of the Baby Boomer generation, reach driving age, millions of new young drivers will be entering the driving pool.  \n\nNational legislation aimed at this problem is feasible and, I believe, essential.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education, but no one under 18 should be permitted to operate a vehicle.  Provisional permits could still be issued prior to granting full licenses, and practical driving training hours, possibly based on the current requirements in most states (such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice), would remain a necessity.  Given that the alarming statistics involving teen drivers are consistent across the nation, uniform, nationwide legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard young people across the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not an unprecedented concept.",
            "During my exploration of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to analyze all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily rely on ingenious editing techniques to create visual illusions. My research centered around describing the stylistic elements common to most of these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics present in a select few later productions. \n\nThe typical trick film from this era tends to be confined to a static set within a frontal proscenium. It features a stationary camera, long and medium shots, and adheres strictly to the principle of one camera shot equating to one complete film. However, there are a handful of early twentieth-century films that challenge these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking characteristic shared by most trick films is their filming within an enclosed set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed in this position, never panning or tracking to follow characters or objects. This compositional approach, common in early cinema,  draws inspiration from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic performances.  One inherent limitation of this stage-bound approach is that characters in trick films primarily move side-to-side, lacking the ability to approach or recede from the camera.  Consider, for example, the action in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even when exiting the frame, the camera does not follow their movements.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots tend to be long shots, occasionally interspersed with medium shots. Close-up shots are entirely absent in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This stylistic choice mirrors the theatrical tradition where the audience views the entire performance at once, framed by the stage boundaries. As actors typically remain in the middle ground and do not advance towards the camera, close-up shots are rendered unnecessary.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow a pattern where one conceptual shot corresponds to an entire film. This limitation restricts the length of most trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic scope of these films; most focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and substitutions, with minimal storytelling. It's important to note that in a trick film, a conceptual shot perceived by the viewer may not necessarily equal a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might actually involve several segments spliced together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Examine \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals the precise moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, a prominent figure in the early Republican movement, emerged from the world of agriculture, a profession that, coupled with his brief foray into politics, shaped his enduring commitment to individual liberty and a limited government. His unwavering dedication to an agrarian society formed the bedrock of his political convictions, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system. \n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a unique opportunity to establish an ideal government, unburdened by the constraints of pre-existing traditions. He believed that the nation's founding presented a chance to craft a system of self-governance firmly rooted in the inherent rights of man. These rights, he argued, were interconnected, inseparable, and indispensable. He asserted that any infringement upon one right would jeopardize the entire fabric of individual liberty, diminishing the value of the remaining rights.  \n\nTo ensure the preservation of these rights, Taylor maintained that the government must remain strictly circumscribed. He envisioned a society where individuals could flourish, free from government overreach. He believed that history demonstrated a tendency for those with physical strength and cunning to exploit the weak in a \"state of nature.\" However, in a civilized society, this imbalance must be rectified through a system that protected the vulnerable.\n\nTaylor's vision of an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the inherent good and evil within humanity. He adhered to a strict dualistic morality, asserting that all actions of government, by their very nature, reflected the complexities of human character.  He defined \"good\" principles as those that safeguarded private property, promoted agricultural prosperity, and tempered the excesses of capitalism. In his view, a government founded on these principles would ensure equitable outcomes regardless of the individuals who held power, as human nature inevitably led to self-interest and ambition.\n\nWhile Taylor recognized the inevitability of human self-interest, he distinguished between its expression within the context of the common good and its potential to undermine it. He argued that self-interest, when channeled toward the betterment of society, was a force for progress. However, when it transcended the pursuit of the public good and led to the exploitation of others, it became a destructive force. A strong government, he believed, was essential to curb these negative tendencies, but even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the adoption of corrupting influences.\n\nLike many of his fellow Republicans, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a limited federal government, with powers explicitly enumerated within its text. He believed that an expansive federal government, burdened by its own complexity, was susceptible to tyranny. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, arguing that understanding the intent of the framers was crucial to prevent misinterpretations and abuses of power.\n\nTaylor held the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, emphasizing its articulation of the United States as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a single, unified nation.",
            "The analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This decline was unexpected and the contributing factors remain unclear.  \n\nSeveral potential explanations exist.  The onset of winter, particularly on a New England campus, could have reduced the number of individuals commuting by bicycle or foot. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity and final preparations for the holiday break.  During this time, completing a commuter log might have become less of a priority for many. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for both students and faculty, during which campus visits are often minimal.  The low number of submissions in January could be attributed to the post-holiday period and the adjustment back to the academic schedule. \n\nHowever, the continued low submission rate in February is more perplexing. One could speculate that any new initiative experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline in participation.  To counter this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a concentrated effort to revitalize the program.  This strategy proved successful, resulting in an increase in log submissions for that month. \n\nOne of the primary challenges encountered was maintaining project momentum, both in the face of anticipated engagement fluctuations and the unique scheduling constraints inherent in the higher education environment.  \n\nAnother challenge common to alternative commuting initiatives is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle autonomy.  To incentivize participation, we offered a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses and national retailers. While these incentives proved effective,  it is intriguing to consider the potential impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid, or electric vehicles.  The consistent prize structure throughout the project may have contributed to the observed decline in engagement.\n\nA dynamic prize system, with increasing value over time, could have potentially stimulated greater participation.  For instance, announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have encouraged a more sustained level of engagement.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, much like index funds.  However, ETFs offer greater flexibility as they trade on stock exchanges, similar to individual shares. This structure provides investors with the diversification benefits of index funds along with the advantages associated with owning individual stocks, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractional shares.\n\nWhile ETFs present enticing benefits, including lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds, it's crucial to be aware of potential drawbacks.  For instance, trading ETFs typically involves brokerage commissions, just like stock trades.  Furthermore, the wide range of available ETFs necessitates careful evaluation to determine if their advertised benefits, such as diversification, are truly realized and to what extent.\n\nThis analysis focuses on examining the IHF ETF and comparing its performance to its ten largest holdings.  The aim is to assess whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these ten individual stocks.  We will also explore the possibility of optimizing returns or risk (measured by the Sharpe ratio) through alternative configurations of these holdings.\n\nGiven the extensive number of holdings within the ETF, this investigation concentrates on the top ten holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  These holdings are listed below, along with their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how effectively these ten stocks represent the overall performance of the IHF ETF, we can leverage their current asset allocation percentages.  By normalizing these percentages to 100%, we can calculate the contribution of each stock to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were composed solely of these ten stocks, mirroring the ETF's holdings structure.  The calculated beta and return values are presented in the subsequent chart.\n\nThe data in the chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings could potentially generate a 6.11% higher return compared to the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer a higher return with lower risk.  However, it is essential to determine whether these differences between the two portfolios are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finest poems. Within this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines 6 and 56, a word traced back to Virgil by scholar H.L. Mencken. Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost boundary of the known world. While Virgil's use is undeniable, a more contemporary source deserves recognition. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nThis particular reference highlights Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe's work might be inspired by Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe's death in 1832.  A short poem within the second part of \"Faust\" is titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem centers on a king who, after his wife gifts him a goblet before her passing, becomes consumed by grief and excessive drinking.  Ultimately, he decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children, save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thulé and the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, potentially reflecting Poe's own experiences with loss and the solace he sought in alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thulé\" in his work \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe utilizes the term \"Thulé\" twice in his written works. While he references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the term \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thulé as dark and desolate, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color, mirroring the emotional state of the King of Thulé from Goethe's poem who, grieving his wife's loss, is consumed by loneliness and a loss of purpose.\n\nGoethe's significance would have made him a familiar figure to Poe, particularly through his admiration for another poet, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  Poe's regard for Tennyson was well-documented. Beyond this connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's works through numerous reproductions that circulated after the original publications.",
            "The legal question at hand concerns the potential for punitive damages in a slip-and-fall case under California law. Specifically, could a customer injured due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if evidence suggests the store manager acted with malice?\n\nA judge would likely not immediately dismiss a punitive damages claim in a situation like this. To justify such an award, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were not merely negligent, but rather exhibited a willful and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result.  Furthermore, the conduct must be deemed \"despicable,\" meaning it evinces a profound lack of moral decency.\n\nIn this instance, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, could argue that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have been aware of the potential danger posed by the uncleaned spill. Previous incidents of slip-and-falls within the store, including multiple instances in the months leading up to Palmer's accident, could be presented as evidence of a pattern of negligence. Despite this knowledge, Martin allegedly failed to address the spill, choosing instead to prioritize his dinner break.\n\nWhile the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less straightforward, it could still hold weight given the documented history of similar incidents. The plaintiff's case might be strengthened by highlighting the six slip-and-fall events that occurred in 2009 alone, suggesting a systemic disregard for customer safety.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows: On October 13, 2009, at approximately 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin reportedly dismissed the concern, stating he was on dinner break and had no time for \"customer complaints.\"  Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also alerted Martin to the spill, receiving the same dismissive response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the uncleaned spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to this incident, five other slip-and-falls had been reported at the store throughout 2009.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded in cases involving breaches of duty, even those not arising from contracts, if the defendant's actions demonstrate \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  The legal definition of malice in this context encompasses conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and involves a \"willful and conscious disregard\" for the rights or safety of others. \n\nCourts have interpreted \"malice\" as involving a conscious disregard for a plaintiff's rights when a defendant, aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions, deliberately chooses to ignore those risks.",
            "During my time at CBC, I delved into the complexities of Islam in a course that sparked fervent debate. A recurring theme was the nature of Islam itself – is it inherently hostile? This question resonates even more strongly today, given the evolving perceptions of Islam in the aftermath of 9/11.  I've witnessed a shift in media portrayals, transitioning from a largely adversarial stance towards Islam and its adherents to an atmosphere of amplified acceptance.  It's hard to imagine a scenario prior to 2001 where a presidential candidate with a background like Barack Obama's, with his evident Muslim lineage, could have even been considered.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents a fascinating paradox. My initial understanding, shaped by historical narratives, painted a picture of a forceful leader who subjugated tribes and compelled them to convert to Islam. However, the biography portrays Muhammad in a different light – as a figure of quiet resilience, misunderstood and even self-effacing. It suggests that individuals gradually embraced his teachings, drawn to the inherent truth they perceived.\n\nIntriguingly, parallels exist between the ministry of Jesus and the narratives surrounding Muhammad's miracles.  One striking example is the story of his provision of sustenance – multiplying meager offerings of mutton and milk to feed a multitude. This literary style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, one whose authenticity resided not in ostentatious displays but in his unwavering commitment to truth. This approach, however, risks minimizing the extraordinary nature of Jesus Christ's miracles. It feels, in a way, like an attempt to borrow from the legacy of Jesus and imbue Muhammad with a similar grandeur.\n\nFurthermore, many stories within the biography appear designed to bolster the notion of voluntary conversions to Islam. However, the reliance on third-party accounts, where information is relayed through a chain of intermediaries, weakens their impact. While the intention may have been to provide irrefutable proof, this reliance on hearsay casts a shadow of doubt, making the narratives appear less credible.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divinely inspired figure – humble, compassionate, wise, and gentle. This idealized portrayal clashes with historical accounts that depict a more complex and sometimes ruthless individual. It compels me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the historical realities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought after Jesus' lifetime diverged significantly from his original teachings.  Examining this trajectory reveals a gradual shift in Christianity, moving further from its roots.  Our contemporary world, marked by a heightened awareness and progressive inclination,  witnesses a growing divide between traditional viewpoints and evolving perspectives. While those clinging to established doctrines may resist change, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the broader Christian landscape. \n\nLooking ahead, a deeper historical understanding is likely to emerge within Christianity, fostering a desire to discern the doctrines that have accumulated over time from Jesus' core message. This process, though potentially spanning decades or even centuries, will inevitably lead to a reversal in the historical trend.  A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of accumulated doctrine, akin to rewinding a clock, ultimately revealing a purer conception of Jesus' original teachings.\n\nAs this movement gains traction in nations like the United States and Europe,  it will inspire widespread adherence to Jesus' original ideas, mirroring the era of his ministry.  While the institutional church will likely remain a powerful force, the theological landscape will experience a significant shift. The current diversity within Christendom will gradually converge towards greater uniformity in belief and practice.  Boundaries between regions, denominations, and factions will blur, leading to increasing similarities.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals.  The transition of the Roman Empire from persecutor of Christians to a predominantly Christian institution stands as a testament to this phenomenon. Similarly, the United States witnessed a profound shift from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The impending reversion within Christianity will likely follow a similar pattern, retracing its steps to its origins and diminishing existing diversity.\n\nA key factor enabling this transformation will be a reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal.  This raises the question: what transpired between Jesus' lifetime and the present day?  \n\nTracing back through history, we encounter Judaism, the theological foundation upon which Christianity was built.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established its core tenets: monotheism, divinely revealed scriptures, and the authority of the Hebrew Bible. However, this religious landscape was not monolithic.  Various factions, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace, coexisted within the Jewish community.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" offers a stark portrayal of human nature, revealing a tendency towards self-preservation and a disregard for those deemed less fortunate. The novel vividly depicts this through the actions of factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit above all else. They are depicted as relentless in their pursuit of expansion, indifferent to the human and environmental costs of their endeavors.  Sinclair utilizes powerful imagery to highlight the damage inflicted by these industrial giants. Describing the factories as \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" with \"great chimneys\" spewing smoke into the distance, he emphasizes the bleak and oppressive environment. This industrial landscape, fueled by the relentless pursuit of wealth, ignores the well-being of both workers and the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nThe novel further exposes the callous treatment of employees. Driven by greed, the owners exploit their workforce, subjecting them to grueling hours and unsafe conditions.  As Sinclair writes, the workplace is characterized by \"jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  The fragility of worker lives is underscored by the threat of sudden layoffs, leaving individuals without income or support.  The absence of labor protections during this era allows the owners to operate with impunity, further exacerbating the plight of the working class.  \n\nEven the unions, intended to provide a voice for the workers, are depicted as corrupt and ineffective, exacerbating the workers' vulnerability. The novel poignantly compares the workers' plight to slavery, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of their exploitation.  Sinclair argues that in this system, where survival hinges on the whims of uncaring employers, \"immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Certain literary techniques allow authors to guide the reader's emotional response to pivotal themes.  \n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald demonstrates mastery of these techniques in his novel, _The Great Gatsby_. He often juxtaposes adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to evoke a specific atmosphere. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning, strategically employing them to reinforce thematic resonance. Colors, in particular, serve as potent symbols in his work, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout _The Great Gatsby_, Fitzgerald carefully constructs meaning around these colors, ultimately using them to trigger specific emotional responses in the reader when encountering significant objects.\n\nWhite and gray, for instance, are imbued with the meaning of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated status, while gray connotes an aged and faded quality. Fitzgerald establishes this duality early in the novel with a pervasive presence of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually clad in \"white\" (8), and this sartorial choice extends to other characters as well: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only exception to this white-dominated color scheme occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). \n\nFitzgerald further solidifies the meaning associated with these colors by applying them to commonplace objects and locations. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). At Gatsby's parties, the names on Nick's timetable become \"gray names\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a visual representation of uniformity (28). Even ordinary people and places are rendered in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is described as \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established a clear connection between white/gray and a sense of unimportance or uniformity, Fitzgerald employs these colors to characterize certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After a prolonged absence, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74). This sudden reintroduction of these colors subtly shifts the reader's perception of Daisy, diminishing her individuality and transforming her into a more uniform object of desire, something Gatsby craves. Fitzgerald reinforces this notion throughout the narrative. We see a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and later, she is again depicted in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County thrives due to its pleasant, sunny climate, yielding a diverse range of crops. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers are among the common produce.  There's a noticeable demand for organically grown food, particularly through community supported agriculture (CSA) programs, with many local organizations experiencing extensive waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also popular choices in the area. Numerous organic farms offer engaging tours of their operations, along with opportunities for recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of farm model presents a unique opportunity for landowners to benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality. This can be achieved through sustainable farming practices that promote wildlife, offer educational programs, and create avenues for generating income. \n\nBeyond catering to a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in both plant and animal life. This is a result of the absence of chemical inputs in the soil and water. However, organic farming practices come with certain challenges. Labor-intensive methods are required for pest and weed control, soil fertilization, and overall management, often leading to higher costs and potentially greater crop losses compared to conventional farming. Additionally, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nPractices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also increase labor costs.  These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or open ground patches. Given these complexities, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profitability and habitat conservation.\n\nThe chosen land for this example is a 160-acre parcel located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  This property consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion designated in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, currently under review, identifies over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining. These include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, along with burrowing owls, which are also at risk.\n\nThis region has a rich history, inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This specific land parcel was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo illustrate the potential of sustainable farming practices on this land, I researched available government programs and their potential benefits for small farmers looking to mitigate costs while preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  For a real-world example, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The influence of cultural factors on negotiation processes cannot be understated.  Culture, a complex and multifaceted concept, is defined as much by its absences as its presences and symbolic meanings. It's crucial to recognize that culture is not monolithic; it lacks homogeneity and uniformity.  Overgeneralizations, such as claiming \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently reductive and fail to capture the nuances of diverse cultural expressions. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a more effective approach for negotiators involves delving deeper into the specific significance of a culture within the context of the negotiation. Understanding how a culture's values and perspectives might shape interactions at the bargaining table is paramount.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, individuals often draw comparisons based on their own cultural lenses.   comprehending another culture's mindset requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing the study of its historical context, social norms, and potential biases. Rather than imposing judgments or attempting to alter a culture, negotiators should strive for acceptance and adaptation.  Working within the established cultural boundaries, particularly when holding a weaker bargaining position, is essential. Similarly, demonstrating respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territories can facilitate smoother negotiations and bridge cultural divides.\n\nIt's important to note that cultural influences extend beyond national borders. Corporate entities often cultivate their own distinct cultures, shaping employee behaviors and interactions. This can manifest in aspects like work hours, dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), delegation practices, and even philanthropic initiatives.  The diversity of corporate cultures within a single nation, as exemplified by the variations within American companies, underscores the richness and complexity of cultural expression within a society. While some cultures may appear more cohesive from an outsider's perspective, this often masks underlying layers of diversity.\n\nValues serve as the bedrock of a culture, providing the rationale behind its beliefs and behaviors. For instance, in cultures where saving face or communal harmony is highly valued, negotiators are less likely to publicly criticize their company or superiors to achieve a favorable outcome. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that prioritize aggressive bargaining tactics may be less inclined to settle quickly. Understanding these cultural values beforehand can significantly inform negotiation strategies. However, personalizing the approach by learning about individual negotiators can further enhance effectiveness.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" is famously found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. This very quote serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief also appears to resonate with another prominent author we'll be examining, Thomas Aquinas.  \n\nGiven that both arguments aim to defend the same concept – the existence of God – and our task is to determine which is more compelling, we'll simplify our analysis by assuming, for the sake of brevity, that both Anselm and Aquinas believe in the God described within the Bible. To ensure a fair comparison, we'll focus on their arguments within the context of this specific God-figure, as any deviation from this framework would hinder a meaningful assessment.\n\nWhile both thinkers present valid points, neither, in my view, offers a truly comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nLet's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the pursuit of understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God lies within the individual's own introspection. He argues that because God exists within our comprehension, we cannot logically conceive of his nonexistence. While his articulation of this concept can be somewhat dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the evidence for God's existence resides within the very fabric of our minds. Anselm proposes that we needn't seek external validation; the truth about God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own consciousness. This reliance on internal conviction, lacking irrefutable empirical evidence, is often referred to as faith within Christian teachings.\n\nThis perspective starkly contrasts with that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas maintains that the existence of God can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, rendering faith superfluous. This approach would undoubtedly be advantageous for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the conversion of new believers without requiring them to accept something beyond empirical verification.\n\nAquinas elaborates on five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the logical necessity for God's existence is inherent in the universe. Imagine, for instance, you are assembling a puzzle and realize you are missing a piece. Even without seeing it, logic dictates that the missing piece must exist and possess specific characteristics based on the completed puzzle.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future leader, later known as Buddha, was born. His life journey involved forsaking worldly possessions and attaining enlightenment, ultimately leading to the establishment of Buddhism. The oldest branch of this faith, Theravada Buddhism, is approximately 2,500 years old. Over time, its practices and interpretations have evolved, as evidenced by the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning such a ritual, both monks and lay believers participate, signifying its religious importance. These changes extend beyond outward customs to the very heart of the faith's doctrines.  Both monastic and lay communities within Theravada Buddhism have adapted their core beliefs over centuries, influenced by a blend of internal and external factors, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently utilize specific terms to clarify its focus.  \"Internal forces\" refer to influences originating from individuals within the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. Conversely, \"external forces\" stem from non-Buddhists. \"Hostile forces\" are those aiming to harm or negatively impact the Buddhist community, driven by misconceptions or prejudice. \"Benign forces,\" while not necessarily intending to aid or hinder Buddhism, may inadvertently have both positive or negative consequences as a byproduct.  These terms will be recurring throughout the analysis.\n\nA fundamental understanding of Theravada Buddhism requires exploring its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these truths is essential for ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continuously perpetuates.  Simultaneously, relinquishing Sansara will alleviate lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes guidelines for conduct. Lay Buddhists adhere to five precepts:  abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Monks, in addition, follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the core of Buddhist thought lies the Four Noble Truths.  First, Dukkha: life involves suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The historical relationship between the United States and Mexico offers a compelling example of a longstanding rivalry.  This period of tension, which lasted approximately half a century, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145), reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.  In this conflict, the United States emerged victorious, annexing territories such as Texas and the American Southwest.  While the war marked a significant escalation, numerous smaller clashes punctuated their interactions over the years, ultimately subsiding prior to the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThis pattern of rivalry between neighboring nations is not unique.  Shared borders often lead to competitions over resources and conflicting interests, fostering strained relations.  The United States and Mexico exemplify this dynamic, mirroring other instances of enduring rivalries between geographically proximate countries.  As David M. Pletcher (1977) observes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations, situated in close proximity to the United States, have historically presented diplomatic challenges, contrasting with the generally amicable relations the United States has maintained with other Latin American countries.\n\nReligious differences also served as a catalyst for friction between the two nations, a recurring theme throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86).  Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which encompassed both ideological and pragmatic dimensions, the U.S.-Mexico dynamic involved a complex interplay of religious beliefs and perceived national interests. This distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, legacies that hampered the establishment of harmonious relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period.  The majority of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including cross-border banditry and frontier skirmishes (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). Border incursions by outlaws and bandits from American border towns posed a significant challenge, persisting until both nations deployed military forces along their shared frontier (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) suggests, the intensity of the rivalry diminished as Mexico's growing dependence on the United States became apparent (p. 109). Ultimately, the shift in American ambitions from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century marked the end of the rivalry (p.110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, my life took an unexpected turn. I was stricken by an illness, one I had never encountered before, leaving me disabled and unable to continue my work as a nurse. \n\nNursing hadn't been my initial aspiration. As a child, I craved stability and security, something my upbringing lacked. The constant reassurance that \"nursing is always in demand\" echoed in my ears, leading me to this profession despite my true passions for science and journalism. \n\nAt 46, unmarried, with limited savings, and facing a future of uncertainty, I found myself reliant on Social Security Disability. Fifteen years later, my resources are depleted, and every day presents a challenge to my well-being and sense of self.  \n\nDespite the hardships, I'm acutely aware that I wouldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. Their assistance has been invaluable, proving that even in the face of adversity, human connection is paramount.\n\nLife, as we know, is unpredictable. We can plan, we can prepare, but some challenges are simply too immense to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that reducing our dependence on government is essential, I believe fostering a sense of community and mutual support is equally crucial.  \n\nWe should focus on rebuilding trust and interconnectedness, helping each other navigate life's storms rather than isolating ourselves in self-reliance. \n\nAmerican history often emphasizes \"rugged individualism,\" but it was compassion, respect, and shared resources that truly sustained our nation's pioneers. The wagon trains traversing the Rockies didn't succeed by going it alone; they relied on collective strength and mutual aid.\n\nTherefore, while preparedness is wise, let's not forget the importance of human connection.  Besides stocking up on essentials like a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and canned goods, invest in your community. Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and create a network of support that will see you through life's inevitable challenges.",
            "The mechanisms driving the evolution of organisms and the factors that influence their developmental trajectories remain fascinating areas of inquiry.  Despite advancements in mathematical modeling,  fully comprehending the intricacies of organic forms remains a significant challenge, as aptly highlighted by D’Arcy Thompson in 1917.  Recent research has explored the application of mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletal development,  including its ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our current study investigates the potential of combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in the genus *Prunum* with experimental analyses to unravel the underlying mechanisms governing the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental transformations.\n\nUtilizing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantitative parameters that could be incorporated into a mathematical model to simulate both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then utilized in the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to generate models of potential shell forms,  allowing us to explore the boundaries of morphological variation within this group. The findings from these models are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to deepen our understanding of macroevolutionary processes within the *Prunum* lineage.\n\nThe structure of a shell can be conceptualized as a tube traversing a three-dimensional space over a 360-degree arc. These rotations or turns, known as whorls, encircle an imaginary central axis, termed the columella, which extends through the shell's central column. The rate of whorl enlargement can vary, with a continuous line separating each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the terminal whorl, also known as the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the opposite end designated as the base.  The animal emerges from the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views.  The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves initially viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the beginning of the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two sections.  Whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell can be visualized as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, a trajectory can be established.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically.  Once a mathematical formulation is developed, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The mortality rates for newborns and infants in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. Despite Indonesia's progress towards achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in areas like water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have unfortunately fallen short of the necessary targets to reach the 2015 goals.  A closer examination of the factors contributing to these shortcomings reveals a critical need to prioritize strengthening the overall health system rather than solely relying on isolated program-based interventions.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed improvements in the percentage of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications during pregnancy, which explains the significant number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage.  Therefore, while this indicator demonstrates some progress, it's crucial to recognize that it presents a somewhat skewed picture and significant work remains to be done.  Furthermore, there's been a concerning decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases among children under five years old that are treated by healthcare professionals. Although data regarding postnatal care is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires urgent attention, with low utilization rates observed across the nation.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than anticipated, hovering around 4%.  These rates also highlight another pressing issue: accessibility disparities within the healthcare system. While the cesarean-section rate stands at 7% in urban areas, it drops to a mere 2% in rural regions. This stark difference underscores the uneven distribution of healthcare services, with urban centers receiving a disproportionate share.  The issue of equitable access extends to vertical equity as well, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. This disparity strongly suggests that impoverished individuals face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, addressing Indonesia's neonatal and maternal care indicators requires a fundamental question: how to best address the existing service gaps. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or focus on bolstering the overall health system without singling out prenatal and postnatal care for mothers and children?  While program-specific solutions might appear appealing, offering more focused, manageable objectives and potentially faster results, they present certain drawbacks.  Concentrating resources on a single health sector often leads to neglect in other areas, diverting human resources towards programs with greater funding. The impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning programs serves as a prime example.  Furthermore, implementing multiple parallel programs for a single issue can result in duplication of services and a lack of coordination, ultimately increasing administrative burdens and hindering efficiency.",
            "Victorian novels are often known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocratic class during that era. However, there are some notable exceptions to this trend. Two such novels, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" while still classified as Victorian, diverge from this conventional path. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, characteristics less common in novels of the time. This unique approach enriches the character development, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\":\n“And now, a flood of bewildering and confusing ideas overwhelmed him. It felt as if he were still caught between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument; their words echoed in his ears.  When he finally managed to regain his focus, he found himself unexpectedly speaking to them. Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire.  Shouts and cries erupted, lights flashed before his eyes, and chaos engulfed him as an unseen force swiftly carried him away. Throughout these rapid visions, a persistent, unsettling awareness of pain gnawed at him, tormenting him relentlessly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels frequently utilize mystery, often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and content vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal glimpses into Oliver's inner world, exposing his vulnerabilities and his understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him.  When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the traumatic event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help (see left). The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire state of his health, which is evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him; his senses are numbed as he fails to notice the “unseen hand” that carries him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, now replaced by a constant and gnawing fear.  Oliver's overwhelming experience raises questions about the forces that have brought about his misfortune, as it is clearly not his own doing. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little agency in his life, unable to exert any control over the outcome of events, even when his life is in jeopardy. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this passage, as if Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own survival.\n\n“The day passed – day? It was gone as soon as it arrived – and night came again; a night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with young students at an after-school program. My primary focus was providing academic support, and I found myself particularly adept at assisting with English and reading comprehension.  One student, a young boy named Adrian, who I believe was in either third or fourth grade, presented a unique challenge. He struggled significantly with reading, exhibiting a peculiar pattern.  Some letters he pronounced flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him.  It was quite unusual.  While he clearly had a Latino background, his spoken English was impeccable.\n\nInitially, we faced considerable difficulties.  However, a turning point arrived when Adrian's mother came to the program.  With most of the other students on a field trip, I was essentially providing impromptu childcare for a few stragglers when she arrived.  She didn't speak a word of English, communicating solely in Spanish.  My own Spanish skills were rudimentary, as I was just beginning to learn the language, but we managed to establish a basic understanding. It was then that a significant realization struck me: Adrian wasn't necessarily struggling to read, but rather, he wasn't fully familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nWhether this revelation ultimately proved helpful, I can't say for certain, but I sincerely hope Adrian has made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the pervasive issue of language barriers within our schools, particularly in California. It also serves as a reminder that challenges can often be more nuanced than they initially appear. Even for a child who speaks fluent English, reading can present substantial obstacles. \n\nThe existence of this problem is undeniable, so the question becomes, what can we do to address it? For Adrian, a relatively straightforward solution was tutoring him in English reading, specifically focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who have limited English proficiency, the solutions are far more complex and multifaceted.\n\nThere is no single panacea. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes, each offer valuable approaches, but none are inherently superior.\n\nThe key lies in a comprehensive and integrated approach, combining these various methods strategically.\n\nDual language programs, for instance, offer tremendous potential not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research has consistently demonstrated that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their monolingual peers academically.  Despite this evidence, there are widespread misconceptions that such programs are a waste of resources and that they primarily benefit a select group of students.  This notion is simply false.\n\nIf we were to embrace these programs as the norm rather than the exception, the educational benefits would be realized across the board.\n\nHow can we achieve this?  Mandating bilingualism for all teachers would be impractical and unrealistic.  However,  I firmly believe that employing specialized bilingual aides or tutors, regardless of their title, is a highly feasible and beneficial strategy.",
            "From our earliest years, many of us are instilled with the idea of something larger than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some seek answers in organized religion, attending Sunday school or temple, while others delve within for their own truths.  Often, we inherit the beliefs of our families, accepting them as our own.  However, some reject these teachings entirely, embracing a purely personal worldview, convinced that their own experiences constitute the entirety of existence. Our values may shift and evolve over time, leading us on a quest to define our individual sense of spirituality.  We yearn for a guiding light, a beacon to navigate the darkness and illuminate our path.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, his voice soft as we sat on the porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop. We shared a cigarette, the air thick with smoke and the scent of petrichor. Water cascaded from the overflowing gutters, drenching the plants lining the porch edge.  He gazed out into the downpour, his eyes distant, as if lost in a world beyond the immediate.  His frame was thinner now, his clothes hanging loosely on his emaciated frame. His hair, once a full head, had thinned, leaving patches of bare scalp exposed. He avoided my gaze, his eyes fixed on the relentless rain. A wave of loneliness and fear washed over me, silencing my words.  How could I speak of the impending loss, the certainty of absence, when to do so would only make it more tangible, more real for both of us? I reached out, embracing him tightly, before settling back into my chair, drawing it closer to his. Together, we watched the rain fall, the world bathed in the dusky hues of the June twilight.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father died. The treatments, the chemo and radiation, had only prolonged his suffering, extending his lifespan beyond the doctors' predictions. But what purpose did this prolonged agony serve? I couldn't comprehend. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered into the silent night, my voice choked with grief. No prayers formed on my lips. If a God existed, I believed he had long since ceased to listen.\n\nThe thought of witnessing his final breaths, his life fading into the unknown, filled me with dread. I couldn't bear to watch the source of my existence slip away. I wanted to remember him as he had lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his own family. I was certain he wouldn't want me to be a mere observer at his deathbed.  I retreated to the sanctuary of my bed, curling into a tight ball, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nBut it never came. No one called.",
            "The concept of the \"Gothic Novel\" presents a fascinating paradox, as Ian Watt aptly points out in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" This literary mode has encountered a spectrum of critical responses, facing both dismissal and acclaim, accused of lacking depth while simultaneously lauded for its evocative \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).\n\nHorace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" widely considered the inaugural work of the Gothic genre, skillfully blends elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romance traditions. This fusion gives rise to a novel form of literary expression, as Walpole, in his preface, designates it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval theatrical conventions, architectural styles, and cultural practices. Notably, the term \"Gothic\" itself carried multifaceted connotations at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, often associated with archaism or perceived cultural inferiority in the face of what was deemed \"modern\" progress. However, the convergence of these \"Gothic\" theatrical elements with the nascent novel format, allowing for a more intimate exploration of characters' inner lives, contributes to the enduring appeal of the Gothic, enabling it to simultaneously feel both antiquated and refreshingly new to readers separated by time from its origins.\n\nA prominent thematic thread woven throughout Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of knighthood, encompassing rigorous training and the cultivation of virtues, is both preserved and reinterpreted in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers due to its symbolic representation of the archetype of the courageous, honorable, and competent knight, a figure which, according to these writers (particularly Walpole), had seemingly faded from contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric principles and conduct, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the genre's eventual evolution into Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a vehicle to critique and potentially ameliorate the perceived moral shortcomings of the present.\n\nWalpole, writing \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a period of political turmoil and personal distress, may have been grappling with anxieties about the future. Facing political challenges and accusations, he possibly reflected on the perceived decline of morality and innate goodness that characterized the \"Gothic era,\" contrasting it with the complexities of his own time. This notion is evident in the character of Frederic. Before his introduction, the reader is presented with descriptions that strongly suggest chivalric qualities:\n\n[Insert the original description of Frederic here]\n\nThe portrayal of Frederic evokes a heightened sense of traditional chivalry, employing exaggerated imagery to introduce the burgeoning Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the intricate network of processes involved in delivering goods from the initial customer order to the final product in the hands of the consumer. This concept, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, focuses on optimizing the entire chain of operations, from raw materials sourcing to production, distribution, and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  \n\nOliver highlighted the importance of a strategic approach, emphasizing the need to plan, implement, and monitor every stage of the supply chain to ensure efficient and timely fulfillment of customer needs.  \n\nSix key elements underpin the effectiveness of a robust supply chain: production, sourcing, inventory management, location strategy, transportation logistics, and information flow.  Businesses leverage these elements to provide exceptional customer service and maintain a competitive edge.\n\nProduction, the initial stage, lays the groundwork for the entire chain. It involves meticulously defining the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of production processes.  Understanding customer demand is paramount, and market analysis serves as a crucial guide in determining product specifications and production volumes. \n\nOnce market insights are gathered, managers must decide on the optimal production locations, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer demand.  Careful scheduling of workloads and equipment maintenance are essential to ensure smooth and efficient production. \n\nThe importance of meticulous planning cannot be overstated, as any oversight can result in significant time and financial losses.  For instance, my experience at retail giants like Walmart and Target revealed the critical role of standardized procedures. \n\nFrom employee uniforms to shipment receiving protocols, every aspect of the business has a well-defined process, minimizing confusion and ensuring seamless operations.",
            "A cardboard sign held aloft by actress Ellen Page, best known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" presents a perplexing message: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"  The sign, scrawled with a Sharpie, portrays a disconcerting juxtaposition against the backdrop of a bustling street corner.  \n\nBurma, more formally known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation currently under the control of a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of public demonstrations, the first in a decade, erupted across the country.  These protests, largely spearheaded by Buddhist monks, were dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" due to the saffron-colored robes worn by the monks.  \n\nInitially, the Burmese government showed a degree of tolerance, permitting peaceful gatherings. However, the situation quickly escalated, transforming into a violent clash with the junta.  Military forces engaged in raids on monasteries, further fueling the unrest.  Foreign journalists who dared to cover the protests faced immediate detention.  Tragically, Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, was killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for documenting the unfolding events.  While official figures cite a death toll of 13, Colonel Hla Win, who had defected from the army, provided a starkly different account, alleging thousands of fatalities that remained unreported. \n\nSadly, this pattern of oppression is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have consistently sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Ancient Roman emperors, for instance, proclaimed themselves divinely ordained rulers, wielding absolute authority over their subjects.  In Japan, emperors were revered as deities, believed to guide their people to prosperity through innovation and tradition.  Even in contemporary times, instances of governmental overreach and suppression of freedom persist.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 serve as a chilling reminder of the brutal consequences of dissent.  Students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered in Tiananmen Square to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Chinese government.  The true death toll from the ensuing crackdown remains shrouded in secrecy, with official figures drastically lower than estimates from independent sources.  Similarly, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s witnessed the systematic extermination of Tutsis and political moderates by Hutu militia groups backed by the Rwandan government.  And, of course, the horrors of Hitler's Third Reich, where Jewish people were systematically persecuted and murdered, stand as a stark testament to the depths of human cruelty when unchecked by compassion and justice.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz genre is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his talent for molding his orchestra. While his presence on the piano often remains understated within the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his ability to craft intricate and richly layered pieces that showcased the individual strengths of each band member. He expertly designed a framework that allowed for spontaneous improvisational flourishes from soloists, while simultaneously composing tightly structured passages and melodic motifs that drew upon the distinctive styles of his musicians to illuminate musical ideas. This meticulous approach extended to the orchestra's overall tone, shaping a cohesive and unique sonic identity for every piece. Through his mastery of each player's individual sound and their collective synergy as an ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most innovative and groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its exploration of Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative spirit, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his innovative use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early composition exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also demonstrates his ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his work. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and the reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions to a more raspy, expressive tone towards its conclusion.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that embellishes the primary melody, highlighting several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response pattern between the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: This chorus marks the climax of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by a rhythmic \"stop-time\" effect from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. This time, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique,  performing as an instrumental solo voice.\n\nTag: A brief concluding tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, unexpected ending provided by a trombone.\n\n\n\nEllington's utilization of voice to add a dimension of tonal color to this piece serves as a single example of a stylistic trait that pervades his entire body of work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his skill in tight orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing seamlessly integrates the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental facets of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sonic tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands on these concepts, as Ellington utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a cornerstone of Ellington's orchestra, to great effect by introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From the time she was fourteen, a persistent feeling of incompleteness had clung to her. This yearning, this void, refused to be ignored, a constant presence in her teenage years. By seventeen, she realized it wasn't a desire for material things, but for a connection with someone. However, she found herself uninterested in the romantic advances of the boys who were drawn to her. They made their awkward attempts, but none of them captured her attention. She often pondered this unusual circumstance, searching for an explanation for this disconnect. Years of introspection yielded theories, but none felt satisfying enough to hold onto. So she lived, navigating life while constantly questioning her own desires.\n\nHer home life was typically tranquil. Her parents were kind, composed individuals, rarely disagreeing with each other. Arguments with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their only clashes arose when she asserted her independence and vibrant personality. Though the offspring of a calm couple, she possessed a lively and engaging spirit that made her both appealing and likeable.\n\nHowever, today was far from peaceful. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice, laced with distress. Rushing into the room, panic rising within her, she cried out, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" She found her mother on the floor, clutching her side, her breathing shallow and pained.  \"Ow...sweetheart...need...hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words fragmented and strained. The urgency in her mother's voice was undeniable. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to get you.\"  Her mother pointed weakly, and the daughter, grateful for the strength training she had undertaken, lifted her mother and carried her to the car. She gently placed her mother in the back seat, lying down, and drove swiftly towards the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a symphony of sterile scents, a mixture of disinfectant and sickness, tinged with fear. But her own fear was overshadowed by her concern for her mother. She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical help. A group of worried faces gathered around, quickly maneuvering a gurney and laying her mother upon it. They whisked her away, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepladder while reaching for a vase on the top shelf.",
            "The purpose of this research was to investigate the connection between adhering to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and plant proteins (excluding potatoes). It also emphasizes monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and incorporates fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted within this dietary approach.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a correlation between adhering to the Med diet and a reduced risk of both total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also demonstrated the Med diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals who are obese, compared to a low-fat diet. However, these earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis observational study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses from 11 US states. Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each woman six times, based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) which assessed their dietary intake during the preceding year.  Over 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this period. The reliability of the FFQs was established through validation studies.\n\nReports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through a review of medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where these records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the study, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category.  For each FFQ, researchers calculated factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary intake, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. These averages combined scores from the previous two years. Adjustments were made for potential \"confounding\" factors (variables that could influence the results) by taking into account age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nThe findings revealed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a greater aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The American economy experienced a significant downturn in 2007, marked by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and the failure of numerous major corporations.  This economic instability persists to this day, prompting a critical examination of its origins and potential solutions.  A key contributing factor was a confluence of political decisions and financial practices that encouraged risky lending practices.  Banks and financial institutions were pressured to extend subprime loans, mortgages offered to borrowers with lower creditworthiness, into a financial system that was already inadequately equipped to handle such risks.  Simultaneously, government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were incentivized to securitize these mortgages, bundling them into complex investment products known as CDOs and CDSs.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.  With an eye toward re-election, the administration sought to boost its popularity by relaxing lending standards, a move that ultimately set the stage for the subprime mortgage crisis several years later.  News reports from that era, such as an article in the New York Times by Steven Holmes, warned of potential consequences, foreshadowing the government's future involvement in bailing out the financial sector.\n\nThe crisis was further exacerbated by the emergence of innovative, yet complex, mortgage products. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became increasingly prevalent, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market.  This interconnectedness led to excessive leverage, particularly among U.S. households and financial institutions, leaving them vulnerable to any downturn in the housing market.\n\nWhen the housing bubble inevitably burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered substantial losses.  Leading investment banks reported staggering amounts of mortgage debt in 2007, representing a significant portion of the U.S. GDP.  The crisis forced several major institutions, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, to collapse, while others, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were compelled to convert to commercial banks subject to stricter regulations.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with massive mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, a corner stone of storytelling, can be a writer's playground or a reader's purgatory. \n\nWhile the adage \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known, even seasoned authors like myself can fall prey to long, expository passages that bog down the narrative.  Imagine, if you will, a scene where a character delivers a torrent of information, akin to a verbal information dump, reminiscent of Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In essence, exposition is the tendency to narratively relay what happens, often in a straightforward manner.\n\nConsider this: a story might state that the protagonist met her soulmate in a specific location and time, followed by a grand wedding and a tragic murder witnessed by the heroine.\n\nNow, imagine this entire sequence unfolding across two pages, with minimal dialogue from both the husband and wife.  This approach would likely leave readers feeling disconnected and unengaged.  \n\nInstead, a more effective approach would delve into the husband's character, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions. We'd witness the heroine's transformation, demonstrating how his presence enriched her life, supporting the later claim that he was profoundly important to her.  \n\nA nuanced introduction to the husband would allow readers to empathize with his fate, and gain insight into the heroine's character: her attraction to him, the depth of their bond, her values and aspirations reflected through his eyes. Ultimately, the reader would grieve alongside the heroine, forging a stronger connection to her.\n\nIn essence, instead of simply outlining the bare bones of the plot (\"They met, they married, he died\"), a writer should provide depth and richness to the narrative.\n\n\nThis often means resisting the urge to rush past details, such as a new character's past experiences, aspirations, or everyday habits.   For instance, a character with an Air Force background, now a gas station night manager, married twice, childless, fishing enthusiast, harboring a secret dream of owning the station, and enjoying Eggs Benedict for breakfast, offers a wealth of material for exploration.",
            "My media consumption this morning centered around two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live report from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011, featured a story about a stabbing in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler, was identified and his mugshot displayed. The report, which lasted approximately two minutes, described the incident as a multiple stabbing and mentioned his subsequent arrest. I felt the coverage was appropriately concise given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second report delved into an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers sustained critical injuries, and at the time of the broadcast, no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was actively investigating the case. This story seemed relatively brief, and I speculated that this might be attributed to the victim's race or the neighborhood's demographics. This observation aligns with a pattern I've noticed over time: media attention often varies when it comes to crime victims based on their racial or ethnic background. For instance, high-profile cases involving white individuals tend to receive more extensive coverage compared to similar incidents involving minorities.\n\nSubsequent segments covered a gunshot hole discovered on a Med-Flight helicopter, a predicted weekend of rain and thunderstorms, and a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. The helicopter incident involved a .22 caliber bullet fired from a rifle, prompting Crime-Stoppers to offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension. The weather report was brief, likely intended as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned. The robbery report described the suspect as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found the emphasis on his race and skin tone to be somewhat noteworthy.\n\nThe final segment focused on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana to Ohio from Texas. Interestingly, instead of explicitly stating the sentence length as 25 years, the broadcast opted for the numerical \"300 months.\" The reason for this stylistic choice was unclear, but perhaps it was intended to convey a harsher tone. Rodriguez's ethnicity was also mentioned, which I felt might not have been essential to the story's core.",
            "The relationship between brothers is marked by a profound and enduring connection. Within this bond reside a complex tapestry of emotions: affection, admiration, envy, and even malice, to name but a few. Brothers possess a unique understanding of each other, surpassing that of any other relationship. They see themselves reflected in their brothers' eyes, not as others perceive them, but as their true selves.  It is in times of extreme hardship that the true nature of this bond comes to the forefront, revealing its  potential for both great good and profound darkness. These emotions, when unleashed, carry a heavy weight, demanding to be acknowledged and addressed. Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal tie involves confronting the consequences they inevitably bring. \n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this intricate theme, delving into the turbulent emotions that accompany it. Set against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered scenery, two young brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile. The narrative culminates in a scene where bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive.  The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother.  The narrator's perspective further illuminates the protagonist's complex feelings and his perception of the world around him, both of which exert a powerful influence on his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven primarily by a consuming emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle.  He yearns for a brother who can keep pace with his adventurous spirit, someone he can share his skills with, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desires a companion for his explorations, someone to race to Horsehead Landing and share moments of quiet companionship in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's physical limitations, stemming from a weak heart, make these aspirations impossible. The protagonist's dreams are shattered by the realization that his brother's frailty will forever prevent him from fully participating in the activities that define his own existence. This realization sparks anger within him, even leading him to contemplate the unthinkable – suffocating Doodle with a pillow. The mere thought reveals the depth of his frustration and the extent to which he feels burdened by his brother's dependence.  \n\nYet, Doodle's innocent smile offers a glimmer of hope, momentarily melting the protagonist's resentment. This simple act of affection suggests that his murderous intentions may not have been deeply rooted. Deep down, a primal bond of love for his brother persists.",
            "The human mind is a intricate system designed for handling information in a creative manner. As technological advancements progressed from rudimentary to sophisticated, the analogies used to describe the brain's functionality also evolved. Initially, comparisons were drawn to a wax tablet, then to a piece of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphorical representations, while helpful, have inherent limitations and can potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nThe initial stage of information processing involves sensory input, where organs like the eyes, ears, and skin transform external stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo a series of transformations within the brain, guided by complex algorithms that function in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. To illustrate, when viewing a picture of a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing analyzes basic elements like color, shape, and boundaries to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages prior knowledge and expectations to accelerate this recognition process. In this case, it might prompt the brain to interpret the shape as a box rather than a void within the white backdrop.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attentional filter determines its significance and directs it towards appropriate cognitive processes. For example, while the brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy attentional filter prevents you from consciously registering each individual blade. Conversely, your name stands out even in a noisy environment due to the filter's prioritization. This filtering mechanism operates across multiple stages of processing, continuously modulating the flow of information.\n\nFor the brain to effectively process information, it must first store it.  Memory systems encompass various categories, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. The initial step involves encoding, which involves transforming information into a format suitable for storage. The specific encoding type depends on the nature of the stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally (based on visual appearance), phonemically (based on sound), or semantically (based on meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on electrical signals circulating through a specific neuronal network for a short duration. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. These models draw upon insights from various fields, including human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" offers a chilling glimpse into a future where technological advancement and a pervasive capitalist system converge to create a dystopian society. The novel explores the dangers of prioritizing collective happiness over individual freedom, highlighting the manipulation and control exerted by a powerful governing authority. Through the lens of Marxist theory, one can discern Huxley's anxieties regarding the trajectory of these societal forces. Terms like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" often used in Marxist analysis, resonate throughout the narrative, suggesting that Huxley saw the emerging economic structures of his time as inherently flawed.\n\nHuxley employs the Marxist concept of \"false consciousness\" to critique capitalism. He portrays the working class, or \"proletariat,\" as being kept ignorant of their true economic position due to their preoccupation with immediate gratification.  This state of ignorance, Huxley argues, is a result of ideological manipulation, a point strikingly evident in the conditioning of the citizens of \"Brave New World.\" The lower social castes, designated as Delta, Gamma, and so on, lack genuine autonomy.  They are systematically conditioned through \"hypnopædia,\" a form of sleep learning, to crave consumption and material excess, ultimately serving the interests of the World Controller, the figurehead of this oppressive regime.\n\nThe novel illustrates the concept of \"hegemony,\" the dominance of a particular group over others, in a stark manner. The lower classes are kept oblivious to the machinations of those in power, essentially \"buying into\" an ideology that perpetuates the existing social and economic structures. Meanwhile, the upper classes, while aware of the system's inherent inequalities, remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions without challenge.\n\nThe absence of meaningful relationships in \"Brave New World\" further underscores Huxley's critique. Characters seem interchangeable, lacking depth and complexity. This superficiality, perhaps, reflects Huxley's belief that technological advancement and unchecked capitalism erode human connection and individuality. Love and genuine emotion are absent, replaced by superficial interactions driven by physical attraction and fleeting pleasure.\n\nThe citizens' unquestioning acceptance of their societal roles and the rigid hierarchy within \"Brave New World\" mirror Marxist theories about the proletariat's acceptance of their subjugation. They are reassured of their superiority as long as they remain compliant consumers, perpetuating the cycle of exploitation.",
            "My time as a student at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, or the equivalent of four and a half semesters.  Campus navigation poses a notable challenge for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at, arguably, the easternmost point of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.  Journeying from my East Halls home to classes located in more central areas, such as the Willard Building, could easily consume up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when contending with inclement weather, which is a frequent occurrence in State College.  Conversations with an alumnus, not much older than myself, revealed that a relatively recent past saw the East Halls dormitories separated from the main campus by vast tracts of undeveloped land. Today, this formerly vacant expanse has been transformed into a vibrant landscape of sports fields, expansive new structures including the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of residential apartments.  As our campus continues to expand, the task of traversing its sprawling grounds becomes increasingly complex.  What constitutes the most effective solution to this mobility dilemma?  In the context of a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer. However, the bicycle alone cannot provide a comprehensive solution; students must actively utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to cater to the needs of cyclists.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had recently returned to cycling after a multi-year hiatus prompted an intriguing observation.  He expressed surprise at his own lapse in cycling, stating, \"Bicycles are fantastic; for a period, it wasn't considered fashionable to ride one, but it's undoubtedly the most practical mode of transportation.\" Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling boasts remarkable efficiency as a means of travel. A modest meal of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel you a distance of 30 miles or more.  Similar to many undergraduates, I currently reside off campus, located a distance from the campus center comparable to that of some dormitories.  The most prudent decision I have made this year was acquiring a bicycle.  Daily, I attend classes in the Thomas Building, a location that entails a 25-minute walk from my residence.  Cycling can significantly reduce this travel time to a mere 5 minutes if I maintain a brisk pace. The primary obstacle lies in Pollock Road, which offers the most direct route to the Thomas Building from my home, but its condition can pose challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists alike.  While walking possesses its merits, my current schedule leaves little room for it.  Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole dependable option for reaching my classes.  Walking to Thomas daily would necessitate an additional 30-40 minutes per day, accumulating to over two and a half hours per week.  Factor in the time required for traversing to and from other classes, appointments, and various other commitments, and the total time commitment becomes unmanageable."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My aspiration to pursue a career in social work stems from a deep desire to contribute to the well-being of children who have endured abuse or neglect. I envision myself working within the Division of Family and Children Services, offering support to both vulnerable children and families grappling with challenges.  \n\nThe field of social work resonates deeply with my personal values: service, respect, ethical conduct, and a steadfast commitment to fostering positive relationships.  I believe these principles extend beyond the professional realm and are fundamental to living a meaningful life.\n\nMy journey toward this calling began with a lifelong inclination toward helping others.  During my academic years, I observed individuals grappling with adversity in various ways, some resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences fueled my initial pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009.  \n\nA pivotal moment occurred during a summer visit with a friend. I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment.  Witnessing his plight ignited a profound desire within me to make a tangible difference. Though the legal system was unable to intervene directly, I felt compelled to offer support. My background in psychology led me to engage with the boy's parents, attempting to understand their perspective and advocate for the child's well-being. This experience solidified my conviction that a career in social work would allow me to directly address the complex needs of children and families.\n\nAnother core value that drives my passion for social work is social justice.  I believe in the inherent worth of every individual and challenge societal norms that perpetuate inequality.  I have consistently advocated for social justice throughout my life, whether through personal expression, activism, or standing up against discrimination.  This commitment will continue to guide my work in social work.",
            "This exploration delves into the theoretical frameworks of biological and sociocultural models, examining their application to the complex sleep disorder, insomnia. The biological model zeroes in on the influence of inherited genetic predispositions and physiological health factors on sleep patterns. Conversely, the sociocultural model investigates the impact of environmental influences, considering variables such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic standing.  This analysis critically reviews pertinent research within each model, elucidating the strengths and limitations of each study's findings.\n\nSleep disorders can manifest in various forms: primary sleep disorders, those secondary to other mental health conditions, or those arising from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders are categorized as either Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass a range of conditions like insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias. These conditions primarily affect the initiation and maintenance of sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities or physiological events during sleep, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and unspecified parasomnias. Sleep disorders linked to mental health often stem from Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, providing a comparative analysis of its relationship to both the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model posits that genes, inherited traits, and physiological factors contribute to the development of sleep disorders. Notably, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness.  A study utilizing mice models demonstrated the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically implicated in sleep-wake cycles. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition reduces anxiety and induces sleep.  Administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) resulted in increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009).  These findings suggest that findings from animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  \n\nPotential dysfunction or absence of this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, possibly necessitating medication for adequate rest. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited variations in this receptor phenotype could influence sleep regulation.  Alterations in receptor function could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting various aspects of life such as academic performance, career success, and daily tasks requiring sustained attention and focus.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is elucidated, outlining common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the document concludes with strategies that educators in inclusive classroom settings can implement to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's effectiveness in utilizing auditory information. In essence, CAPD involves the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process sound input and the neurological activity underlying this process (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This signifies that individuals with CAPD may experience difficulties in accurately interpreting sounds despite possessing normal hearing abilities. The brain's region responsible for deciphering speech, distinguishing words, and segregating conversations from background noise may not function optimally.\n\nThe earliest documented instances of the condition, initially termed \"auditory imperception,\" emerged in the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers investigating children with communicative disorders were among the first to observe these auditory processing challenges. In 1954, an Italian research team composed of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of tests for children exhibiting these difficulties. Subsequently, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 further fueled research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways. Individuals with CAPD may struggle with sound localization, auditory discrimination, pattern recognition, and speech comprehension. They might have difficulty distinguishing between sounds, perceiving changes in speech intonation (e.g., sarcasm), or processing sequential auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves thorough observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and psychologists. These assessments may encompass questionnaires, behavioral observations, and specialized tests that evaluate various auditory-related skills. Notably, there is currently no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool, and the underlying cause of CAPD remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and require them to identify specific sounds or sequences. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and analyzing the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex nature of disguise and its implications for self-discovery and interpersonal relationships. While acknowledging the potential for deception to be effective in the short term, the play ultimately suggests that individuals must confront their assumed identities to avoid becoming lost in the act of pretense.  However, revealing the truth can lead to alienation and strained connections.\n\nThe play presents a compelling dilemma: choosing between preserving one's authentic self and safeguarding existing relationships. Some might react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, while others may harbor resentment and offense, further complicating matters.\n\nGender role reversal within the context of deception adds another layer of complexity.  A crucial question emerges: why would someone feel compelled to abandon their own identity and adopt the guise of the opposite gender?  In Viola's case, her decision stems from a need for self-preservation.  Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, she adopts the male persona of Cesario as a protective measure against potential threats: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nWhile her disguise proves effective, it simultaneously isolates her from the female community, depriving her of a vital support network.  Furthermore, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads Olivia to misidentify her as Sebastian and develop romantic feelings: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138).  Adding to the complexity, Viola grapples with suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nDespite its potentially progressive elements, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on how deception can illuminate hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's assumed identity. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario driven by his perceived masculinity, or does it reflect a deeper, perhaps unconscious, inclination towards women?  \n\nIt's plausible that Olivia's character serves as a satire of those in Shakespeare's era who judge individuals solely based on appearances, as evidenced by her swift transition of affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her subsequent shift in perception of Cesario/Viola to one of familial regard: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule across its various territories has been subject to criticism, particularly concerning its actions in German South West Africa, where the Ovaherero and Nama people suffered a horrific genocide. However, it would be reductive to solely define the German colonial enterprise through such a lens.  The empire displayed a remarkable diversity in its governing strategies and policies, mirroring the vast geographical spread of its possessions. \n\nEducational initiatives undertaken within the colonies also demonstrated this variability. When Britain assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanzania) in 1919, they encountered a populace with a significant number of educated and literate individuals.  German educational endeavors in other colonies, such as Kamerun, were lauded by contemporary writers.\n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government actively established state schools and played a central role in educating the native population, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  Despite this, the government did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing state schools and providing substantial backing and oversight for missionary educational institutions.  These contrasting educational policies had enduring consequences for South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by formal education, with the vast majority of the population remaining illiterate.\n\nVarious social, political, and economic factors converged to create this divergent experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native African population, drawing upon recent research in this area.\n\nExisting scholarship on education within the German colonial empire is extensive.  Most of these sources, primarily originating from the early twentieth century, were written in German and focus on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the colonies. Later works, predominantly in English, have expanded this discourse through comparative analyses of education across the various German colonies and in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies have highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies.\n\nThe seminal work directly addressing the subject of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and explores the factors contributing to their differences.  Cohen posits that the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining many of the unique characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, though much of its territory is characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has become incredibly intricate, encompassing a vast array of genres that are practically impossible to completely list. This complexity is further amplified by the fact that most, if not all, genres – encompassing styles like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk – have branched out into numerous subgenres and even sub-subgenres.\n\nWithin this expansive landscape, heavy metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the last forty years. Its expressiveness stems from its capacity to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though these often gravitate towards the darker end.  The genre's diversity is equally remarkable, as soon after its inception, artists began recognizing its inherent flexibility and began experimenting, giving rise to subgenres, which in turn spawned their own sub-subgenres, and so on, creating a continuous chain of evolution.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement finds itself at a point where its numerous niches make it challenging to definitively define what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from a multitude of other genres, yet, like any significant cultural phenomenon, it originated from a specific source. To truly comprehend the diverse tapestry of heavy metal music that permeates the contemporary scene, one must first delve into the origins of the movement itself, understanding its essence as a cultural force rather than merely a musical genre.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement deeply rooted in the exploration of darkness. It can be characterized as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. In contrast to earlier, more primitive forms, metal emphasizes technical proficiency; musicians in metal bands demonstrate exceptional skill and command over their instruments, a virtuosity that resonates throughout their music. Moreover, it's undeniable that metal has a strong connection to the influence of drugs. The psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s fueled a wave of experimentation, leading to the creation of unconventional and otherworldly music, often using drugs as a catalyst for artistic expression. \n\nIts dark, visceral qualities were groundbreaking in the music scene, as much of popular music at the time lacked a strong connection to the darker aspects of the human emotional experience. Later generations of metal musicians have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral aesthetics prevalent in the Romantic era. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this darkness: \n\n\"Helter Skelter\" showcases a darker side to the Beatles, with its chaotic and seemingly drug-induced imagery. This song is often cited as one of the earliest examples of heavy metal, serving as a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones track.  The Beatles sought to demonstrate their own capacity for intensity, including this song on their iconic \"The White Album.\"",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealism, a singular artist named Henri Rousseau was painstakingly constructing his own imaginative worlds, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\"  depicts not only a woman awestruck by the wonders of her dream-induced landscape but also reflects Rousseau's own aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts.  However, this ambition presented him with a profound internal conflict: should he conform to prevailing painting styles to gain acceptance within the art world he deeply revered, or should he embrace creative independence and forge his own unique path? \"The Dream\" stands as a powerful testament to this lifelong struggle, encapsulating Rousseau's internal battle between conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully comprehend the layered meaning of \"The Dream,\" one must first delve into Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau's upbringing was far removed from the world of artistic refinement. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, enjoyed a comfortable middle-class existence. Formal art training eluded Rousseau, who spent forty years working for the French government as a toll collector, despite being mistakenly labeled a customs inspector. The profound loss of his wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with a single daughter, Julia, and an overwhelming sense of grief.  In search of solace and renewal, Rousseau turned to painting as a means of finding comfort and embarking on a fresh chapter in his life. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the hopes and dreams of the ordinary working class.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for recognition within the art world can be understood in light of his unique circumstances.  He lacked formal training and began his artistic career relatively late in life, navigating a landscape dominated by established and celebrated artists.  While he had been painting for years, his work only gained significant attention around the time Matisse began making a name for himself. According to art historian Jan Gordon, despite being artistic competitors, Rousseau and Matisse differed not only in style and subject matter, but also in their motivations. Gordon states that while Matisse sought to avoid painting in a predictable or clichéd manner, Rousseau's ambition was to create such a conventional work that he would be admitted to the prestigious Artiste Français society (92).",
            "Throughout history, many influential thinkers have explored the profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental link between truth and beauty. This relationship resonates deeply, as poet John Keats eloquently expresses in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  While much of our understanding of the world stems from formal education or personal experiences, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics appears to transcend these conventional learning methods. Both disciplines, as Keats implies, function more as descriptions than prescriptive guides. Our investigations into morality and beauty primarily aim to decipher why a particular artwork or literary piece holds aesthetic value or why a certain action is deemed ethical, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral conduct.\n\nFurthermore, any critique of art or morality inevitably falls short of capturing the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty. For instance, a discussion about the merits of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might delve into elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context. However, these analytical tools ultimately fail to fully elucidate the reasons behind its artistic brilliance. When individuals are asked about their favorite works of art or literature, they often preface their explanations with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" highlighting an elusive quality that transcends mere description.\n\nI believe that both art and morality possess an inherent characteristic that cannot be entirely reduced to a catalog of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor aptly stated, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we dissect the components of a literary work, a transcendent element remains, a \"je ne sais quoi\" that defies complete articulation.\n\nThis intangible essence, I propose, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. It is this very quality that links them, as Wittgenstein suggests, stating: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"  \n\nI posit that this shared transcendental nature forms a crucial connection between ethics and aesthetics.\n\nMorality and art intertwine profoundly because we experience them most powerfully on a noumenal level, a concept borrowed from Kant's philosophy. They evoke an impact that can be felt but not fully comprehended through rational analysis. This connection becomes even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Contemporary Germany stands as a powerful nation, united and characterized by a distinct culture that stretches from the Bavarian Alps in München to the Baltic Sea port city of Kiel. This cultural tapestry is evident from Köln, situated along the Rhine River, to the heart of the country and the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled on the Elbe. Given this rich and varied cultural heritage, it is not surprising that modern Germany evolved from a confluence of diverse tribes and origins.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people is known as Germania. The etymology of this name remains a subject of debate among historians and scholars. The Roman historian Tacitus asserted that the name derived from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who, prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls, were known by a different name. (Tacitus, 98) Julius Caesar, in his writings on the Gallic Wars, was the first to employ the term \"Germanus.\" In his account of his campaigns against the Gauls and his encounters with Germanic tribes frequently crossing the Rhine, Caesar adopted the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those who remained unconquered. Some scholars suggest that the term \"Germanus\" originated from a neighboring people in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of the first book of his Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)  Alternatively, others propose that the name derives from the spear used in Germanic warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" which might allude to the perceived loud and boisterous nature of the Germans. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" which delves into the origins of the Germans, wrote: \"I should regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave the Roman heartland for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not at that time, at least. They ventured into the lands of Germania for trade and occasionally launched military campaigns, but ultimately, they primarily returned to their vast empire. Consequently, as Germanic tribes emerged in the middle of the first century AD, they resided on the periphery of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods derived from their lands and offering their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army. (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17)",
            "My gaze drifted downward, my thoughts a silent, unmoving sea. I observed the scene before me with a detached focus, analyzing each detail without allowing it to truly register. Ideas flickered in and out of my consciousness, fleeting and inconsequential. My mind operated with a mechanical precision, devoid of genuine emotion or reflection.\n\nYears ago, inspired by an artist I once collaborated with, I bought a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" The desire to draw had been with me since childhood, and this book promised to unlock the secrets of artistic perception. It delved into the intricate ways our brains interpret lines and shapes, even suggesting techniques like framing a picture within an imaginary square to simplify complex compositions.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at the object before me, I couldn't summon the artist's perspective. Overwhelmed by its presence, I could only stand and absorb its essence. Artistic giants like Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters had all found their signature styles: a blue phase, a love for greens, a riot of colors.  This, I thought, was my beginning, the genesis of my own artistic journey. I envisioned a piece titled \"Work in Brown,\" a testament to the raw, unfiltered experience before me.\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for my chosen tool, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, guided by an intangible internal force. This could be the dawn of creation, the birth of something truly unique. Water swirled serenely, a crystal-clear mirror reflecting the world around it. Fragments detached, carried away on the current.\n\nBut the moment shattered. My hand, now trembling with a nervous energy, slammed the toilet handle again. The stubborn object remained, stubbornly clinging to the porcelain.\n\nMy grip tightened on the mop, my feet planted firmly on the ground. A green tie felt like a noose around my neck. I frowned, my gaze fixed on the unwelcome deposit someone had left behind. A message, perhaps, for those who cleaned these public spaces. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand moved towards the wall, reaching for the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand, transforming it into a makeshift mitt.\n\nWith a final, decisive movement, I plunged my hand into the bowl, mimicking the gesture of a mother tending to a roast in the oven.",
            "Young individuals are facing a dangerous reality behind the wheel.  Several converging factors contribute to the alarming statistic of fatalities among the youngest drivers.  Research from the National Institutes of Health highlights that the adolescent brain is not fully developed for the complexities of driving.  Inexperience, a fundamental element in this issue, not only leads to a higher frequency of fatal accidents but also increases the likelihood of rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road.  \n\nFurthermore, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly amplifies these risks. Studies conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, for example, demonstrate a direct correlation between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.  \n\nIn an effort to mitigate these dangers, some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing programs for teenagers. These programs restrict driving hours and prohibit younger passengers. However, in my view, these measures are merely temporary solutions.  The core problem lies in the fact that, statistically, young drivers, as a group, lack the maturity and capabilities to adequately handle the inherent risks and responsibilities of operating a motor vehicle.  Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, a renowned psychologist, even argues that the age of 18 is too young for a full driver's license. His research suggests that individuals under the age of 19-20 possess a heightened inclination towards risk-taking behavior driven by a desire for thrills.  Therefore, delaying driving until this impulsive tendency diminishes seems prudent. \n\nFailure to address this issue will undoubtedly result in continued tragedies on our roads, with the potential for a catastrophic increase in fatalities in the coming years.  As the \"Millennials,\" the children of the Baby Boomer generation, reach driving age, millions of new young drivers will be entering the driving pool.  \n\nNational legislation aimed at this problem is feasible and, I believe, essential.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education, but no one under 18 should be permitted to operate a vehicle.  Provisional permits could still be issued prior to granting full licenses, and practical driving training hours, possibly based on the current requirements in most states (such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice), would remain a necessity.  Given that the alarming statistics involving teen drivers are consistent across the nation, uniform, nationwide legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard young people across the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not an unprecedented concept.",
            "During my exploration of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to analyze all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily rely on ingenious editing techniques to create visual illusions. My research centered around describing the stylistic elements common to most of these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics present in a select few later productions. \n\nThe typical trick film from this era tends to be confined to a static set within a frontal proscenium. It features a stationary camera, long and medium shots, and adheres strictly to the principle of one camera shot equating to one complete film. However, there are a handful of early twentieth-century films that challenge these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking characteristic shared by most trick films is their filming within an enclosed set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed in this position, never panning or tracking to follow characters or objects. This compositional approach, common in early cinema,  draws inspiration from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic performances.  One inherent limitation of this stage-bound approach is that characters in trick films primarily move side-to-side, lacking the ability to approach or recede from the camera.  Consider, for example, the action in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even when exiting the frame, the camera does not follow their movements.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots tend to be long shots, occasionally interspersed with medium shots. Close-up shots are entirely absent in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This stylistic choice mirrors the theatrical tradition where the audience views the entire performance at once, framed by the stage boundaries. As actors typically remain in the middle ground and do not advance towards the camera, close-up shots are rendered unnecessary.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow a pattern where one conceptual shot corresponds to an entire film. This limitation restricts the length of most trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic scope of these films; most focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and substitutions, with minimal storytelling. It's important to note that in a trick film, a conceptual shot perceived by the viewer may not necessarily equal a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might actually involve several segments spliced together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Examine \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals the precise moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, a prominent figure in the early Republican movement, emerged from the world of agriculture, a profession that, coupled with his brief foray into politics, shaped his enduring commitment to individual liberty and a limited government. His unwavering dedication to an agrarian society formed the bedrock of his political convictions, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system. \n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a unique opportunity to establish an ideal government, unburdened by the constraints of pre-existing traditions. He believed that the nation's founding presented a chance to craft a system of self-governance firmly rooted in the inherent rights of man. These rights, he argued, were interconnected, inseparable, and indispensable. He asserted that any infringement upon one right would jeopardize the entire fabric of individual liberty, diminishing the value of the remaining rights.  \n\nTo ensure the preservation of these rights, Taylor maintained that the government must remain strictly circumscribed. He envisioned a society where individuals could flourish, free from government overreach. He believed that history demonstrated a tendency for those with physical strength and cunning to exploit the weak in a \"state of nature.\" However, in a civilized society, this imbalance must be rectified through a system that protected the vulnerable.\n\nTaylor's vision of an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the inherent good and evil within humanity. He adhered to a strict dualistic morality, asserting that all actions of government, by their very nature, reflected the complexities of human character.  He defined \"good\" principles as those that safeguarded private property, promoted agricultural prosperity, and tempered the excesses of capitalism. In his view, a government founded on these principles would ensure equitable outcomes regardless of the individuals who held power, as human nature inevitably led to self-interest and ambition.\n\nWhile Taylor recognized the inevitability of human self-interest, he distinguished between its expression within the context of the common good and its potential to undermine it. He argued that self-interest, when channeled toward the betterment of society, was a force for progress. However, when it transcended the pursuit of the public good and led to the exploitation of others, it became a destructive force. A strong government, he believed, was essential to curb these negative tendencies, but even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the adoption of corrupting influences.\n\nLike many of his fellow Republicans, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a limited federal government, with powers explicitly enumerated within its text. He believed that an expansive federal government, burdened by its own complexity, was susceptible to tyranny. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, arguing that understanding the intent of the framers was crucial to prevent misinterpretations and abuses of power.\n\nTaylor held the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, emphasizing its articulation of the United States as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a single, unified nation.",
            "The analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This decline was unexpected and the contributing factors remain unclear.  \n\nSeveral potential explanations exist.  The onset of winter, particularly on a New England campus, could have reduced the number of individuals commuting by bicycle or foot. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity and final preparations for the holiday break.  During this time, completing a commuter log might have become less of a priority for many. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for both students and faculty, during which campus visits are often minimal.  The low number of submissions in January could be attributed to the post-holiday period and the adjustment back to the academic schedule. \n\nHowever, the continued low submission rate in February is more perplexing. One could speculate that any new initiative experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline in participation.  To counter this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a concentrated effort to revitalize the program.  This strategy proved successful, resulting in an increase in log submissions for that month. \n\nOne of the primary challenges encountered was maintaining project momentum, both in the face of anticipated engagement fluctuations and the unique scheduling constraints inherent in the higher education environment.  \n\nAnother challenge common to alternative commuting initiatives is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle autonomy.  To incentivize participation, we offered a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses and national retailers. While these incentives proved effective,  it is intriguing to consider the potential impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid, or electric vehicles.  The consistent prize structure throughout the project may have contributed to the observed decline in engagement.\n\nA dynamic prize system, with increasing value over time, could have potentially stimulated greater participation.  For instance, announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have encouraged a more sustained level of engagement.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, much like index funds.  However, ETFs offer greater flexibility as they trade on stock exchanges, similar to individual shares. This structure provides investors with the diversification benefits of index funds along with the advantages associated with owning individual stocks, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractional shares.\n\nWhile ETFs present enticing benefits, including lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds, it's crucial to be aware of potential drawbacks.  For instance, trading ETFs typically involves brokerage commissions, just like stock trades.  Furthermore, the wide range of available ETFs necessitates careful evaluation to determine if their advertised benefits, such as diversification, are truly realized and to what extent.\n\nThis analysis focuses on examining the IHF ETF and comparing its performance to its ten largest holdings.  The aim is to assess whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these ten individual stocks.  We will also explore the possibility of optimizing returns or risk (measured by the Sharpe ratio) through alternative configurations of these holdings.\n\nGiven the extensive number of holdings within the ETF, this investigation concentrates on the top ten holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  These holdings are listed below, along with their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how effectively these ten stocks represent the overall performance of the IHF ETF, we can leverage their current asset allocation percentages.  By normalizing these percentages to 100%, we can calculate the contribution of each stock to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were composed solely of these ten stocks, mirroring the ETF's holdings structure.  The calculated beta and return values are presented in the subsequent chart.\n\nThe data in the chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings could potentially generate a 6.11% higher return compared to the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer a higher return with lower risk.  However, it is essential to determine whether these differences between the two portfolios are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finest poems. Within this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines 6 and 56, a word traced back to Virgil by scholar H.L. Mencken. Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost boundary of the known world. While Virgil's use is undeniable, a more contemporary source deserves recognition. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nThis particular reference highlights Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe's work might be inspired by Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe's death in 1832.  A short poem within the second part of \"Faust\" is titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem centers on a king who, after his wife gifts him a goblet before her passing, becomes consumed by grief and excessive drinking.  Ultimately, he decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children, save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thulé and the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, potentially reflecting Poe's own experiences with loss and the solace he sought in alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thulé\" in his work \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe utilizes the term \"Thulé\" twice in his written works. While he references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the term \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thulé as dark and desolate, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color, mirroring the emotional state of the King of Thulé from Goethe's poem who, grieving his wife's loss, is consumed by loneliness and a loss of purpose.\n\nGoethe's significance would have made him a familiar figure to Poe, particularly through his admiration for another poet, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  Poe's regard for Tennyson was well-documented. Beyond this connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's works through numerous reproductions that circulated after the original publications.",
            "The legal question at hand concerns the potential for punitive damages in a slip-and-fall case under California law. Specifically, could a customer injured due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if evidence suggests the store manager acted with malice?\n\nA judge would likely not immediately dismiss a punitive damages claim in a situation like this. To justify such an award, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were not merely negligent, but rather exhibited a willful and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result.  Furthermore, the conduct must be deemed \"despicable,\" meaning it evinces a profound lack of moral decency.\n\nIn this instance, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, could argue that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have been aware of the potential danger posed by the uncleaned spill. Previous incidents of slip-and-falls within the store, including multiple instances in the months leading up to Palmer's accident, could be presented as evidence of a pattern of negligence. Despite this knowledge, Martin allegedly failed to address the spill, choosing instead to prioritize his dinner break.\n\nWhile the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less straightforward, it could still hold weight given the documented history of similar incidents. The plaintiff's case might be strengthened by highlighting the six slip-and-fall events that occurred in 2009 alone, suggesting a systemic disregard for customer safety.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows: On October 13, 2009, at approximately 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin reportedly dismissed the concern, stating he was on dinner break and had no time for \"customer complaints.\"  Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also alerted Martin to the spill, receiving the same dismissive response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the uncleaned spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to this incident, five other slip-and-falls had been reported at the store throughout 2009.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded in cases involving breaches of duty, even those not arising from contracts, if the defendant's actions demonstrate \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  The legal definition of malice in this context encompasses conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and involves a \"willful and conscious disregard\" for the rights or safety of others. \n\nCourts have interpreted \"malice\" as involving a conscious disregard for a plaintiff's rights when a defendant, aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions, deliberately chooses to ignore those risks.",
            "During my time at CBC, I delved into the complexities of Islam in a course that sparked fervent debate. A recurring theme was the nature of Islam itself – is it inherently hostile? This question resonates even more strongly today, given the evolving perceptions of Islam in the aftermath of 9/11.  I've witnessed a shift in media portrayals, transitioning from a largely adversarial stance towards Islam and its adherents to an atmosphere of amplified acceptance.  It's hard to imagine a scenario prior to 2001 where a presidential candidate with a background like Barack Obama's, with his evident Muslim lineage, could have even been considered.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents a fascinating paradox. My initial understanding, shaped by historical narratives, painted a picture of a forceful leader who subjugated tribes and compelled them to convert to Islam. However, the biography portrays Muhammad in a different light – as a figure of quiet resilience, misunderstood and even self-effacing. It suggests that individuals gradually embraced his teachings, drawn to the inherent truth they perceived.\n\nIntriguingly, parallels exist between the ministry of Jesus and the narratives surrounding Muhammad's miracles.  One striking example is the story of his provision of sustenance – multiplying meager offerings of mutton and milk to feed a multitude. This literary style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, one whose authenticity resided not in ostentatious displays but in his unwavering commitment to truth. This approach, however, risks minimizing the extraordinary nature of Jesus Christ's miracles. It feels, in a way, like an attempt to borrow from the legacy of Jesus and imbue Muhammad with a similar grandeur.\n\nFurthermore, many stories within the biography appear designed to bolster the notion of voluntary conversions to Islam. However, the reliance on third-party accounts, where information is relayed through a chain of intermediaries, weakens their impact. While the intention may have been to provide irrefutable proof, this reliance on hearsay casts a shadow of doubt, making the narratives appear less credible.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divinely inspired figure – humble, compassionate, wise, and gentle. This idealized portrayal clashes with historical accounts that depict a more complex and sometimes ruthless individual. It compels me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the historical realities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought after Jesus' lifetime diverged significantly from his original teachings.  Examining this trajectory reveals a gradual shift in Christianity, moving further from its roots.  Our contemporary world, marked by a heightened awareness and progressive inclination,  witnesses a growing divide between traditional viewpoints and evolving perspectives. While those clinging to established doctrines may resist change, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the broader Christian landscape. \n\nLooking ahead, a deeper historical understanding is likely to emerge within Christianity, fostering a desire to discern the doctrines that have accumulated over time from Jesus' core message. This process, though potentially spanning decades or even centuries, will inevitably lead to a reversal in the historical trend.  A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of accumulated doctrine, akin to rewinding a clock, ultimately revealing a purer conception of Jesus' original teachings.\n\nAs this movement gains traction in nations like the United States and Europe,  it will inspire widespread adherence to Jesus' original ideas, mirroring the era of his ministry.  While the institutional church will likely remain a powerful force, the theological landscape will experience a significant shift. The current diversity within Christendom will gradually converge towards greater uniformity in belief and practice.  Boundaries between regions, denominations, and factions will blur, leading to increasing similarities.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals.  The transition of the Roman Empire from persecutor of Christians to a predominantly Christian institution stands as a testament to this phenomenon. Similarly, the United States witnessed a profound shift from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The impending reversion within Christianity will likely follow a similar pattern, retracing its steps to its origins and diminishing existing diversity.\n\nA key factor enabling this transformation will be a reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal.  This raises the question: what transpired between Jesus' lifetime and the present day?  \n\nTracing back through history, we encounter Judaism, the theological foundation upon which Christianity was built.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established its core tenets: monotheism, divinely revealed scriptures, and the authority of the Hebrew Bible. However, this religious landscape was not monolithic.  Various factions, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace, coexisted within the Jewish community.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" offers a stark portrayal of human nature, revealing a tendency towards self-preservation and a disregard for those deemed less fortunate. The novel vividly depicts this through the actions of factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit above all else. They are depicted as relentless in their pursuit of expansion, indifferent to the human and environmental costs of their endeavors.  Sinclair utilizes powerful imagery to highlight the damage inflicted by these industrial giants. Describing the factories as \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" with \"great chimneys\" spewing smoke into the distance, he emphasizes the bleak and oppressive environment. This industrial landscape, fueled by the relentless pursuit of wealth, ignores the well-being of both workers and the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nThe novel further exposes the callous treatment of employees. Driven by greed, the owners exploit their workforce, subjecting them to grueling hours and unsafe conditions.  As Sinclair writes, the workplace is characterized by \"jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  The fragility of worker lives is underscored by the threat of sudden layoffs, leaving individuals without income or support.  The absence of labor protections during this era allows the owners to operate with impunity, further exacerbating the plight of the working class.  \n\nEven the unions, intended to provide a voice for the workers, are depicted as corrupt and ineffective, exacerbating the workers' vulnerability. The novel poignantly compares the workers' plight to slavery, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of their exploitation.  Sinclair argues that in this system, where survival hinges on the whims of uncaring employers, \"immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Certain literary techniques allow authors to guide the reader's emotional response to pivotal themes.  \n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald demonstrates mastery of these techniques in his novel, _The Great Gatsby_. He often juxtaposes adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to evoke a specific atmosphere. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning, strategically employing them to reinforce thematic resonance. Colors, in particular, serve as potent symbols in his work, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout _The Great Gatsby_, Fitzgerald carefully constructs meaning around these colors, ultimately using them to trigger specific emotional responses in the reader when encountering significant objects.\n\nWhite and gray, for instance, are imbued with the meaning of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated status, while gray connotes an aged and faded quality. Fitzgerald establishes this duality early in the novel with a pervasive presence of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually clad in \"white\" (8), and this sartorial choice extends to other characters as well: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only exception to this white-dominated color scheme occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). \n\nFitzgerald further solidifies the meaning associated with these colors by applying them to commonplace objects and locations. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). At Gatsby's parties, the names on Nick's timetable become \"gray names\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a visual representation of uniformity (28). Even ordinary people and places are rendered in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is described as \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established a clear connection between white/gray and a sense of unimportance or uniformity, Fitzgerald employs these colors to characterize certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After a prolonged absence, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74). This sudden reintroduction of these colors subtly shifts the reader's perception of Daisy, diminishing her individuality and transforming her into a more uniform object of desire, something Gatsby craves. Fitzgerald reinforces this notion throughout the narrative. We see a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and later, she is again depicted in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County thrives due to its pleasant, sunny climate, yielding a diverse range of crops. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers are among the common produce.  There's a noticeable demand for organically grown food, particularly through community supported agriculture (CSA) programs, with many local organizations experiencing extensive waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also popular choices in the area. Numerous organic farms offer engaging tours of their operations, along with opportunities for recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of farm model presents a unique opportunity for landowners to benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality. This can be achieved through sustainable farming practices that promote wildlife, offer educational programs, and create avenues for generating income. \n\nBeyond catering to a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in both plant and animal life. This is a result of the absence of chemical inputs in the soil and water. However, organic farming practices come with certain challenges. Labor-intensive methods are required for pest and weed control, soil fertilization, and overall management, often leading to higher costs and potentially greater crop losses compared to conventional farming. Additionally, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nPractices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also increase labor costs.  These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or open ground patches. Given these complexities, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profitability and habitat conservation.\n\nThe chosen land for this example is a 160-acre parcel located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  This property consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion designated in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, currently under review, identifies over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining. These include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, along with burrowing owls, which are also at risk.\n\nThis region has a rich history, inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This specific land parcel was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo illustrate the potential of sustainable farming practices on this land, I researched available government programs and their potential benefits for small farmers looking to mitigate costs while preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  For a real-world example, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The influence of cultural factors on negotiation processes cannot be understated.  Culture, a complex and multifaceted concept, is defined as much by its absences as its presences and symbolic meanings. It's crucial to recognize that culture is not monolithic; it lacks homogeneity and uniformity.  Overgeneralizations, such as claiming \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently reductive and fail to capture the nuances of diverse cultural expressions. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a more effective approach for negotiators involves delving deeper into the specific significance of a culture within the context of the negotiation. Understanding how a culture's values and perspectives might shape interactions at the bargaining table is paramount.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, individuals often draw comparisons based on their own cultural lenses.   comprehending another culture's mindset requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing the study of its historical context, social norms, and potential biases. Rather than imposing judgments or attempting to alter a culture, negotiators should strive for acceptance and adaptation.  Working within the established cultural boundaries, particularly when holding a weaker bargaining position, is essential. Similarly, demonstrating respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territories can facilitate smoother negotiations and bridge cultural divides.\n\nIt's important to note that cultural influences extend beyond national borders. Corporate entities often cultivate their own distinct cultures, shaping employee behaviors and interactions. This can manifest in aspects like work hours, dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), delegation practices, and even philanthropic initiatives.  The diversity of corporate cultures within a single nation, as exemplified by the variations within American companies, underscores the richness and complexity of cultural expression within a society. While some cultures may appear more cohesive from an outsider's perspective, this often masks underlying layers of diversity.\n\nValues serve as the bedrock of a culture, providing the rationale behind its beliefs and behaviors. For instance, in cultures where saving face or communal harmony is highly valued, negotiators are less likely to publicly criticize their company or superiors to achieve a favorable outcome. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that prioritize aggressive bargaining tactics may be less inclined to settle quickly. Understanding these cultural values beforehand can significantly inform negotiation strategies. However, personalizing the approach by learning about individual negotiators can further enhance effectiveness.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" is famously found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. This very quote serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief also appears to resonate with another prominent author we'll be examining, Thomas Aquinas.  \n\nGiven that both arguments aim to defend the same concept – the existence of God – and our task is to determine which is more compelling, we'll simplify our analysis by assuming, for the sake of brevity, that both Anselm and Aquinas believe in the God described within the Bible. To ensure a fair comparison, we'll focus on their arguments within the context of this specific God-figure, as any deviation from this framework would hinder a meaningful assessment.\n\nWhile both thinkers present valid points, neither, in my view, offers a truly comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nLet's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the pursuit of understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God lies within the individual's own introspection. He argues that because God exists within our comprehension, we cannot logically conceive of his nonexistence. While his articulation of this concept can be somewhat dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the evidence for God's existence resides within the very fabric of our minds. Anselm proposes that we needn't seek external validation; the truth about God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own consciousness. This reliance on internal conviction, lacking irrefutable empirical evidence, is often referred to as faith within Christian teachings.\n\nThis perspective starkly contrasts with that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas maintains that the existence of God can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, rendering faith superfluous. This approach would undoubtedly be advantageous for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the conversion of new believers without requiring them to accept something beyond empirical verification.\n\nAquinas elaborates on five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the logical necessity for God's existence is inherent in the universe. Imagine, for instance, you are assembling a puzzle and realize you are missing a piece. Even without seeing it, logic dictates that the missing piece must exist and possess specific characteristics based on the completed puzzle.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future leader, later known as Buddha, was born. His life journey involved forsaking worldly possessions and attaining enlightenment, ultimately leading to the establishment of Buddhism. The oldest branch of this faith, Theravada Buddhism, is approximately 2,500 years old. Over time, its practices and interpretations have evolved, as evidenced by the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning such a ritual, both monks and lay believers participate, signifying its religious importance. These changes extend beyond outward customs to the very heart of the faith's doctrines.  Both monastic and lay communities within Theravada Buddhism have adapted their core beliefs over centuries, influenced by a blend of internal and external factors, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently utilize specific terms to clarify its focus.  \"Internal forces\" refer to influences originating from individuals within the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. Conversely, \"external forces\" stem from non-Buddhists. \"Hostile forces\" are those aiming to harm or negatively impact the Buddhist community, driven by misconceptions or prejudice. \"Benign forces,\" while not necessarily intending to aid or hinder Buddhism, may inadvertently have both positive or negative consequences as a byproduct.  These terms will be recurring throughout the analysis.\n\nA fundamental understanding of Theravada Buddhism requires exploring its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these truths is essential for ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continuously perpetuates.  Simultaneously, relinquishing Sansara will alleviate lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes guidelines for conduct. Lay Buddhists adhere to five precepts:  abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Monks, in addition, follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the core of Buddhist thought lies the Four Noble Truths.  First, Dukkha: life involves suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The historical relationship between the United States and Mexico offers a compelling example of a longstanding rivalry.  This period of tension, which lasted approximately half a century, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145), reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.  In this conflict, the United States emerged victorious, annexing territories such as Texas and the American Southwest.  While the war marked a significant escalation, numerous smaller clashes punctuated their interactions over the years, ultimately subsiding prior to the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThis pattern of rivalry between neighboring nations is not unique.  Shared borders often lead to competitions over resources and conflicting interests, fostering strained relations.  The United States and Mexico exemplify this dynamic, mirroring other instances of enduring rivalries between geographically proximate countries.  As David M. Pletcher (1977) observes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations, situated in close proximity to the United States, have historically presented diplomatic challenges, contrasting with the generally amicable relations the United States has maintained with other Latin American countries.\n\nReligious differences also served as a catalyst for friction between the two nations, a recurring theme throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86).  Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which encompassed both ideological and pragmatic dimensions, the U.S.-Mexico dynamic involved a complex interplay of religious beliefs and perceived national interests. This distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, legacies that hampered the establishment of harmonious relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period.  The majority of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including cross-border banditry and frontier skirmishes (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). Border incursions by outlaws and bandits from American border towns posed a significant challenge, persisting until both nations deployed military forces along their shared frontier (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) suggests, the intensity of the rivalry diminished as Mexico's growing dependence on the United States became apparent (p. 109). Ultimately, the shift in American ambitions from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century marked the end of the rivalry (p.110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, my life took an unexpected turn. I was stricken by an illness, one I had never encountered before, leaving me disabled and unable to continue my work as a nurse. \n\nNursing hadn't been my initial aspiration. As a child, I craved stability and security, something my upbringing lacked. The constant reassurance that \"nursing is always in demand\" echoed in my ears, leading me to this profession despite my true passions for science and journalism. \n\nAt 46, unmarried, with limited savings, and facing a future of uncertainty, I found myself reliant on Social Security Disability. Fifteen years later, my resources are depleted, and every day presents a challenge to my well-being and sense of self.  \n\nDespite the hardships, I'm acutely aware that I wouldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. Their assistance has been invaluable, proving that even in the face of adversity, human connection is paramount.\n\nLife, as we know, is unpredictable. We can plan, we can prepare, but some challenges are simply too immense to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that reducing our dependence on government is essential, I believe fostering a sense of community and mutual support is equally crucial.  \n\nWe should focus on rebuilding trust and interconnectedness, helping each other navigate life's storms rather than isolating ourselves in self-reliance. \n\nAmerican history often emphasizes \"rugged individualism,\" but it was compassion, respect, and shared resources that truly sustained our nation's pioneers. The wagon trains traversing the Rockies didn't succeed by going it alone; they relied on collective strength and mutual aid.\n\nTherefore, while preparedness is wise, let's not forget the importance of human connection.  Besides stocking up on essentials like a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and canned goods, invest in your community. Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and create a network of support that will see you through life's inevitable challenges.",
            "The mechanisms driving the evolution of organisms and the factors that influence their developmental trajectories remain fascinating areas of inquiry.  Despite advancements in mathematical modeling,  fully comprehending the intricacies of organic forms remains a significant challenge, as aptly highlighted by D’Arcy Thompson in 1917.  Recent research has explored the application of mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletal development,  including its ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our current study investigates the potential of combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in the genus *Prunum* with experimental analyses to unravel the underlying mechanisms governing the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental transformations.\n\nUtilizing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantitative parameters that could be incorporated into a mathematical model to simulate both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then utilized in the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to generate models of potential shell forms,  allowing us to explore the boundaries of morphological variation within this group. The findings from these models are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to deepen our understanding of macroevolutionary processes within the *Prunum* lineage.\n\nThe structure of a shell can be conceptualized as a tube traversing a three-dimensional space over a 360-degree arc. These rotations or turns, known as whorls, encircle an imaginary central axis, termed the columella, which extends through the shell's central column. The rate of whorl enlargement can vary, with a continuous line separating each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the terminal whorl, also known as the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the opposite end designated as the base.  The animal emerges from the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views.  The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves initially viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the beginning of the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two sections.  Whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell can be visualized as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, a trajectory can be established.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically.  Once a mathematical formulation is developed, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The mortality rates for newborns and infants in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. Despite Indonesia's progress towards achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in areas like water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have unfortunately fallen short of the necessary targets to reach the 2015 goals.  A closer examination of the factors contributing to these shortcomings reveals a critical need to prioritize strengthening the overall health system rather than solely relying on isolated program-based interventions.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed improvements in the percentage of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications during pregnancy, which explains the significant number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage.  Therefore, while this indicator demonstrates some progress, it's crucial to recognize that it presents a somewhat skewed picture and significant work remains to be done.  Furthermore, there's been a concerning decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases among children under five years old that are treated by healthcare professionals. Although data regarding postnatal care is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires urgent attention, with low utilization rates observed across the nation.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than anticipated, hovering around 4%.  These rates also highlight another pressing issue: accessibility disparities within the healthcare system. While the cesarean-section rate stands at 7% in urban areas, it drops to a mere 2% in rural regions. This stark difference underscores the uneven distribution of healthcare services, with urban centers receiving a disproportionate share.  The issue of equitable access extends to vertical equity as well, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. This disparity strongly suggests that impoverished individuals face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, addressing Indonesia's neonatal and maternal care indicators requires a fundamental question: how to best address the existing service gaps. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or focus on bolstering the overall health system without singling out prenatal and postnatal care for mothers and children?  While program-specific solutions might appear appealing, offering more focused, manageable objectives and potentially faster results, they present certain drawbacks.  Concentrating resources on a single health sector often leads to neglect in other areas, diverting human resources towards programs with greater funding. The impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning programs serves as a prime example.  Furthermore, implementing multiple parallel programs for a single issue can result in duplication of services and a lack of coordination, ultimately increasing administrative burdens and hindering efficiency.",
            "Victorian novels are often known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocratic class during that era. However, there are some notable exceptions to this trend. Two such novels, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" while still classified as Victorian, diverge from this conventional path. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, characteristics less common in novels of the time. This unique approach enriches the character development, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\":\n“And now, a flood of bewildering and confusing ideas overwhelmed him. It felt as if he were still caught between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument; their words echoed in his ears.  When he finally managed to regain his focus, he found himself unexpectedly speaking to them. Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire.  Shouts and cries erupted, lights flashed before his eyes, and chaos engulfed him as an unseen force swiftly carried him away. Throughout these rapid visions, a persistent, unsettling awareness of pain gnawed at him, tormenting him relentlessly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels frequently utilize mystery, often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and content vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal glimpses into Oliver's inner world, exposing his vulnerabilities and his understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him.  When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the traumatic event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help (see left). The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire state of his health, which is evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him; his senses are numbed as he fails to notice the “unseen hand” that carries him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, now replaced by a constant and gnawing fear.  Oliver's overwhelming experience raises questions about the forces that have brought about his misfortune, as it is clearly not his own doing. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little agency in his life, unable to exert any control over the outcome of events, even when his life is in jeopardy. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this passage, as if Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own survival.\n\n“The day passed – day? It was gone as soon as it arrived – and night came again; a night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with young students at an after-school program. My primary focus was providing academic support, and I found myself particularly adept at assisting with English and reading comprehension.  One student, a young boy named Adrian, who I believe was in either third or fourth grade, presented a unique challenge. He struggled significantly with reading, exhibiting a peculiar pattern.  Some letters he pronounced flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him.  It was quite unusual.  While he clearly had a Latino background, his spoken English was impeccable.\n\nInitially, we faced considerable difficulties.  However, a turning point arrived when Adrian's mother came to the program.  With most of the other students on a field trip, I was essentially providing impromptu childcare for a few stragglers when she arrived.  She didn't speak a word of English, communicating solely in Spanish.  My own Spanish skills were rudimentary, as I was just beginning to learn the language, but we managed to establish a basic understanding. It was then that a significant realization struck me: Adrian wasn't necessarily struggling to read, but rather, he wasn't fully familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nWhether this revelation ultimately proved helpful, I can't say for certain, but I sincerely hope Adrian has made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the pervasive issue of language barriers within our schools, particularly in California. It also serves as a reminder that challenges can often be more nuanced than they initially appear. Even for a child who speaks fluent English, reading can present substantial obstacles. \n\nThe existence of this problem is undeniable, so the question becomes, what can we do to address it? For Adrian, a relatively straightforward solution was tutoring him in English reading, specifically focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who have limited English proficiency, the solutions are far more complex and multifaceted.\n\nThere is no single panacea. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes, each offer valuable approaches, but none are inherently superior.\n\nThe key lies in a comprehensive and integrated approach, combining these various methods strategically.\n\nDual language programs, for instance, offer tremendous potential not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research has consistently demonstrated that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their monolingual peers academically.  Despite this evidence, there are widespread misconceptions that such programs are a waste of resources and that they primarily benefit a select group of students.  This notion is simply false.\n\nIf we were to embrace these programs as the norm rather than the exception, the educational benefits would be realized across the board.\n\nHow can we achieve this?  Mandating bilingualism for all teachers would be impractical and unrealistic.  However,  I firmly believe that employing specialized bilingual aides or tutors, regardless of their title, is a highly feasible and beneficial strategy.",
            "From our earliest years, many of us are instilled with the idea of something larger than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some seek answers in organized religion, attending Sunday school or temple, while others delve within for their own truths.  Often, we inherit the beliefs of our families, accepting them as our own.  However, some reject these teachings entirely, embracing a purely personal worldview, convinced that their own experiences constitute the entirety of existence. Our values may shift and evolve over time, leading us on a quest to define our individual sense of spirituality.  We yearn for a guiding light, a beacon to navigate the darkness and illuminate our path.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, his voice soft as we sat on the porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop. We shared a cigarette, the air thick with smoke and the scent of petrichor. Water cascaded from the overflowing gutters, drenching the plants lining the porch edge.  He gazed out into the downpour, his eyes distant, as if lost in a world beyond the immediate.  His frame was thinner now, his clothes hanging loosely on his emaciated frame. His hair, once a full head, had thinned, leaving patches of bare scalp exposed. He avoided my gaze, his eyes fixed on the relentless rain. A wave of loneliness and fear washed over me, silencing my words.  How could I speak of the impending loss, the certainty of absence, when to do so would only make it more tangible, more real for both of us? I reached out, embracing him tightly, before settling back into my chair, drawing it closer to his. Together, we watched the rain fall, the world bathed in the dusky hues of the June twilight.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father died. The treatments, the chemo and radiation, had only prolonged his suffering, extending his lifespan beyond the doctors' predictions. But what purpose did this prolonged agony serve? I couldn't comprehend. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered into the silent night, my voice choked with grief. No prayers formed on my lips. If a God existed, I believed he had long since ceased to listen.\n\nThe thought of witnessing his final breaths, his life fading into the unknown, filled me with dread. I couldn't bear to watch the source of my existence slip away. I wanted to remember him as he had lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his own family. I was certain he wouldn't want me to be a mere observer at his deathbed.  I retreated to the sanctuary of my bed, curling into a tight ball, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nBut it never came. No one called.",
            "The concept of the \"Gothic Novel\" presents a fascinating paradox, as Ian Watt aptly points out in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" This literary mode has encountered a spectrum of critical responses, facing both dismissal and acclaim, accused of lacking depth while simultaneously lauded for its evocative \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).\n\nHorace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" widely considered the inaugural work of the Gothic genre, skillfully blends elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romance traditions. This fusion gives rise to a novel form of literary expression, as Walpole, in his preface, designates it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval theatrical conventions, architectural styles, and cultural practices. Notably, the term \"Gothic\" itself carried multifaceted connotations at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, often associated with archaism or perceived cultural inferiority in the face of what was deemed \"modern\" progress. However, the convergence of these \"Gothic\" theatrical elements with the nascent novel format, allowing for a more intimate exploration of characters' inner lives, contributes to the enduring appeal of the Gothic, enabling it to simultaneously feel both antiquated and refreshingly new to readers separated by time from its origins.\n\nA prominent thematic thread woven throughout Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of knighthood, encompassing rigorous training and the cultivation of virtues, is both preserved and reinterpreted in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers due to its symbolic representation of the archetype of the courageous, honorable, and competent knight, a figure which, according to these writers (particularly Walpole), had seemingly faded from contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric principles and conduct, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the genre's eventual evolution into Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a vehicle to critique and potentially ameliorate the perceived moral shortcomings of the present.\n\nWalpole, writing \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a period of political turmoil and personal distress, may have been grappling with anxieties about the future. Facing political challenges and accusations, he possibly reflected on the perceived decline of morality and innate goodness that characterized the \"Gothic era,\" contrasting it with the complexities of his own time. This notion is evident in the character of Frederic. Before his introduction, the reader is presented with descriptions that strongly suggest chivalric qualities:\n\n[Insert the original description of Frederic here]\n\nThe portrayal of Frederic evokes a heightened sense of traditional chivalry, employing exaggerated imagery to introduce the burgeoning Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the intricate network of processes involved in delivering goods from the initial customer order to the final product in the hands of the consumer. This concept, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, focuses on optimizing the entire chain of operations, from raw materials sourcing to production, distribution, and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  \n\nOliver highlighted the importance of a strategic approach, emphasizing the need to plan, implement, and monitor every stage of the supply chain to ensure efficient and timely fulfillment of customer needs.  \n\nSix key elements underpin the effectiveness of a robust supply chain: production, sourcing, inventory management, location strategy, transportation logistics, and information flow.  Businesses leverage these elements to provide exceptional customer service and maintain a competitive edge.\n\nProduction, the initial stage, lays the groundwork for the entire chain. It involves meticulously defining the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of production processes.  Understanding customer demand is paramount, and market analysis serves as a crucial guide in determining product specifications and production volumes. \n\nOnce market insights are gathered, managers must decide on the optimal production locations, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer demand.  Careful scheduling of workloads and equipment maintenance are essential to ensure smooth and efficient production. \n\nThe importance of meticulous planning cannot be overstated, as any oversight can result in significant time and financial losses.  For instance, my experience at retail giants like Walmart and Target revealed the critical role of standardized procedures. \n\nFrom employee uniforms to shipment receiving protocols, every aspect of the business has a well-defined process, minimizing confusion and ensuring seamless operations.",
            "A cardboard sign held aloft by actress Ellen Page, best known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" presents a perplexing message: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"  The sign, scrawled with a Sharpie, portrays a disconcerting juxtaposition against the backdrop of a bustling street corner.  \n\nBurma, more formally known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation currently under the control of a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of public demonstrations, the first in a decade, erupted across the country.  These protests, largely spearheaded by Buddhist monks, were dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" due to the saffron-colored robes worn by the monks.  \n\nInitially, the Burmese government showed a degree of tolerance, permitting peaceful gatherings. However, the situation quickly escalated, transforming into a violent clash with the junta.  Military forces engaged in raids on monasteries, further fueling the unrest.  Foreign journalists who dared to cover the protests faced immediate detention.  Tragically, Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, was killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for documenting the unfolding events.  While official figures cite a death toll of 13, Colonel Hla Win, who had defected from the army, provided a starkly different account, alleging thousands of fatalities that remained unreported. \n\nSadly, this pattern of oppression is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have consistently sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Ancient Roman emperors, for instance, proclaimed themselves divinely ordained rulers, wielding absolute authority over their subjects.  In Japan, emperors were revered as deities, believed to guide their people to prosperity through innovation and tradition.  Even in contemporary times, instances of governmental overreach and suppression of freedom persist.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 serve as a chilling reminder of the brutal consequences of dissent.  Students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered in Tiananmen Square to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Chinese government.  The true death toll from the ensuing crackdown remains shrouded in secrecy, with official figures drastically lower than estimates from independent sources.  Similarly, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s witnessed the systematic extermination of Tutsis and political moderates by Hutu militia groups backed by the Rwandan government.  And, of course, the horrors of Hitler's Third Reich, where Jewish people were systematically persecuted and murdered, stand as a stark testament to the depths of human cruelty when unchecked by compassion and justice.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz genre is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his talent for molding his orchestra. While his presence on the piano often remains understated within the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his ability to craft intricate and richly layered pieces that showcased the individual strengths of each band member. He expertly designed a framework that allowed for spontaneous improvisational flourishes from soloists, while simultaneously composing tightly structured passages and melodic motifs that drew upon the distinctive styles of his musicians to illuminate musical ideas. This meticulous approach extended to the orchestra's overall tone, shaping a cohesive and unique sonic identity for every piece. Through his mastery of each player's individual sound and their collective synergy as an ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most innovative and groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its exploration of Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative spirit, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his innovative use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early composition exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also demonstrates his ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his work. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and the reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions to a more raspy, expressive tone towards its conclusion.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that embellishes the primary melody, highlighting several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response pattern between the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: This chorus marks the climax of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by a rhythmic \"stop-time\" effect from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. This time, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique,  performing as an instrumental solo voice.\n\nTag: A brief concluding tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, unexpected ending provided by a trombone.\n\n\n\nEllington's utilization of voice to add a dimension of tonal color to this piece serves as a single example of a stylistic trait that pervades his entire body of work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his skill in tight orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing seamlessly integrates the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental facets of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sonic tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands on these concepts, as Ellington utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a cornerstone of Ellington's orchestra, to great effect by introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From the time she was fourteen, a persistent feeling of incompleteness had clung to her. This yearning, this void, refused to be ignored, a constant presence in her teenage years. By seventeen, she realized it wasn't a desire for material things, but for a connection with someone. However, she found herself uninterested in the romantic advances of the boys who were drawn to her. They made their awkward attempts, but none of them captured her attention. She often pondered this unusual circumstance, searching for an explanation for this disconnect. Years of introspection yielded theories, but none felt satisfying enough to hold onto. So she lived, navigating life while constantly questioning her own desires.\n\nHer home life was typically tranquil. Her parents were kind, composed individuals, rarely disagreeing with each other. Arguments with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their only clashes arose when she asserted her independence and vibrant personality. Though the offspring of a calm couple, she possessed a lively and engaging spirit that made her both appealing and likeable.\n\nHowever, today was far from peaceful. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice, laced with distress. Rushing into the room, panic rising within her, she cried out, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" She found her mother on the floor, clutching her side, her breathing shallow and pained.  \"Ow...sweetheart...need...hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words fragmented and strained. The urgency in her mother's voice was undeniable. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to get you.\"  Her mother pointed weakly, and the daughter, grateful for the strength training she had undertaken, lifted her mother and carried her to the car. She gently placed her mother in the back seat, lying down, and drove swiftly towards the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a symphony of sterile scents, a mixture of disinfectant and sickness, tinged with fear. But her own fear was overshadowed by her concern for her mother. She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical help. A group of worried faces gathered around, quickly maneuvering a gurney and laying her mother upon it. They whisked her away, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepladder while reaching for a vase on the top shelf.",
            "The purpose of this research was to investigate the connection between adhering to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and plant proteins (excluding potatoes). It also emphasizes monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and incorporates fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted within this dietary approach.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a correlation between adhering to the Med diet and a reduced risk of both total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also demonstrated the Med diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals who are obese, compared to a low-fat diet. However, these earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis observational study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses from 11 US states. Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each woman six times, based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) which assessed their dietary intake during the preceding year.  Over 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this period. The reliability of the FFQs was established through validation studies.\n\nReports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through a review of medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where these records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the study, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category.  For each FFQ, researchers calculated factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary intake, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. These averages combined scores from the previous two years. Adjustments were made for potential \"confounding\" factors (variables that could influence the results) by taking into account age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nThe findings revealed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a greater aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The American economy experienced a significant downturn in 2007, marked by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and the failure of numerous major corporations.  This economic instability persists to this day, prompting a critical examination of its origins and potential solutions.  A key contributing factor was a confluence of political decisions and financial practices that encouraged risky lending practices.  Banks and financial institutions were pressured to extend subprime loans, mortgages offered to borrowers with lower creditworthiness, into a financial system that was already inadequately equipped to handle such risks.  Simultaneously, government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were incentivized to securitize these mortgages, bundling them into complex investment products known as CDOs and CDSs.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.  With an eye toward re-election, the administration sought to boost its popularity by relaxing lending standards, a move that ultimately set the stage for the subprime mortgage crisis several years later.  News reports from that era, such as an article in the New York Times by Steven Holmes, warned of potential consequences, foreshadowing the government's future involvement in bailing out the financial sector.\n\nThe crisis was further exacerbated by the emergence of innovative, yet complex, mortgage products. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became increasingly prevalent, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market.  This interconnectedness led to excessive leverage, particularly among U.S. households and financial institutions, leaving them vulnerable to any downturn in the housing market.\n\nWhen the housing bubble inevitably burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered substantial losses.  Leading investment banks reported staggering amounts of mortgage debt in 2007, representing a significant portion of the U.S. GDP.  The crisis forced several major institutions, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, to collapse, while others, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were compelled to convert to commercial banks subject to stricter regulations.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with massive mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, a corner stone of storytelling, can be a writer's playground or a reader's purgatory. \n\nWhile the adage \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known, even seasoned authors like myself can fall prey to long, expository passages that bog down the narrative.  Imagine, if you will, a scene where a character delivers a torrent of information, akin to a verbal information dump, reminiscent of Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In essence, exposition is the tendency to narratively relay what happens, often in a straightforward manner.\n\nConsider this: a story might state that the protagonist met her soulmate in a specific location and time, followed by a grand wedding and a tragic murder witnessed by the heroine.\n\nNow, imagine this entire sequence unfolding across two pages, with minimal dialogue from both the husband and wife.  This approach would likely leave readers feeling disconnected and unengaged.  \n\nInstead, a more effective approach would delve into the husband's character, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions. We'd witness the heroine's transformation, demonstrating how his presence enriched her life, supporting the later claim that he was profoundly important to her.  \n\nA nuanced introduction to the husband would allow readers to empathize with his fate, and gain insight into the heroine's character: her attraction to him, the depth of their bond, her values and aspirations reflected through his eyes. Ultimately, the reader would grieve alongside the heroine, forging a stronger connection to her.\n\nIn essence, instead of simply outlining the bare bones of the plot (\"They met, they married, he died\"), a writer should provide depth and richness to the narrative.\n\n\nThis often means resisting the urge to rush past details, such as a new character's past experiences, aspirations, or everyday habits.   For instance, a character with an Air Force background, now a gas station night manager, married twice, childless, fishing enthusiast, harboring a secret dream of owning the station, and enjoying Eggs Benedict for breakfast, offers a wealth of material for exploration.",
            "My media consumption this morning centered around two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live report from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011, featured a story about a stabbing in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler, was identified and his mugshot displayed. The report, which lasted approximately two minutes, described the incident as a multiple stabbing and mentioned his subsequent arrest. I felt the coverage was appropriately concise given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second report delved into an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers sustained critical injuries, and at the time of the broadcast, no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was actively investigating the case. This story seemed relatively brief, and I speculated that this might be attributed to the victim's race or the neighborhood's demographics. This observation aligns with a pattern I've noticed over time: media attention often varies when it comes to crime victims based on their racial or ethnic background. For instance, high-profile cases involving white individuals tend to receive more extensive coverage compared to similar incidents involving minorities.\n\nSubsequent segments covered a gunshot hole discovered on a Med-Flight helicopter, a predicted weekend of rain and thunderstorms, and a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. The helicopter incident involved a .22 caliber bullet fired from a rifle, prompting Crime-Stoppers to offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension. The weather report was brief, likely intended as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned. The robbery report described the suspect as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found the emphasis on his race and skin tone to be somewhat noteworthy.\n\nThe final segment focused on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana to Ohio from Texas. Interestingly, instead of explicitly stating the sentence length as 25 years, the broadcast opted for the numerical \"300 months.\" The reason for this stylistic choice was unclear, but perhaps it was intended to convey a harsher tone. Rodriguez's ethnicity was also mentioned, which I felt might not have been essential to the story's core.",
            "The relationship between brothers is marked by a profound and enduring connection. Within this bond reside a complex tapestry of emotions: affection, admiration, envy, and even malice, to name but a few. Brothers possess a unique understanding of each other, surpassing that of any other relationship. They see themselves reflected in their brothers' eyes, not as others perceive them, but as their true selves.  It is in times of extreme hardship that the true nature of this bond comes to the forefront, revealing its  potential for both great good and profound darkness. These emotions, when unleashed, carry a heavy weight, demanding to be acknowledged and addressed. Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal tie involves confronting the consequences they inevitably bring. \n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this intricate theme, delving into the turbulent emotions that accompany it. Set against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered scenery, two young brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile. The narrative culminates in a scene where bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive.  The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother.  The narrator's perspective further illuminates the protagonist's complex feelings and his perception of the world around him, both of which exert a powerful influence on his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven primarily by a consuming emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle.  He yearns for a brother who can keep pace with his adventurous spirit, someone he can share his skills with, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desires a companion for his explorations, someone to race to Horsehead Landing and share moments of quiet companionship in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's physical limitations, stemming from a weak heart, make these aspirations impossible. The protagonist's dreams are shattered by the realization that his brother's frailty will forever prevent him from fully participating in the activities that define his own existence. This realization sparks anger within him, even leading him to contemplate the unthinkable – suffocating Doodle with a pillow. The mere thought reveals the depth of his frustration and the extent to which he feels burdened by his brother's dependence.  \n\nYet, Doodle's innocent smile offers a glimmer of hope, momentarily melting the protagonist's resentment. This simple act of affection suggests that his murderous intentions may not have been deeply rooted. Deep down, a primal bond of love for his brother persists.",
            "The human mind is a intricate system designed for handling information in a creative manner. As technological advancements progressed from rudimentary to sophisticated, the analogies used to describe the brain's functionality also evolved. Initially, comparisons were drawn to a wax tablet, then to a piece of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphorical representations, while helpful, have inherent limitations and can potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nThe initial stage of information processing involves sensory input, where organs like the eyes, ears, and skin transform external stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo a series of transformations within the brain, guided by complex algorithms that function in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. To illustrate, when viewing a picture of a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing analyzes basic elements like color, shape, and boundaries to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages prior knowledge and expectations to accelerate this recognition process. In this case, it might prompt the brain to interpret the shape as a box rather than a void within the white backdrop.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attentional filter determines its significance and directs it towards appropriate cognitive processes. For example, while the brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy attentional filter prevents you from consciously registering each individual blade. Conversely, your name stands out even in a noisy environment due to the filter's prioritization. This filtering mechanism operates across multiple stages of processing, continuously modulating the flow of information.\n\nFor the brain to effectively process information, it must first store it.  Memory systems encompass various categories, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. The initial step involves encoding, which involves transforming information into a format suitable for storage. The specific encoding type depends on the nature of the stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally (based on visual appearance), phonemically (based on sound), or semantically (based on meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on electrical signals circulating through a specific neuronal network for a short duration. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. These models draw upon insights from various fields, including human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" offers a chilling glimpse into a future where technological advancement and a pervasive capitalist system converge to create a dystopian society. The novel explores the dangers of prioritizing collective happiness over individual freedom, highlighting the manipulation and control exerted by a powerful governing authority. Through the lens of Marxist theory, one can discern Huxley's anxieties regarding the trajectory of these societal forces. Terms like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" often used in Marxist analysis, resonate throughout the narrative, suggesting that Huxley saw the emerging economic structures of his time as inherently flawed.\n\nHuxley employs the Marxist concept of \"false consciousness\" to critique capitalism. He portrays the working class, or \"proletariat,\" as being kept ignorant of their true economic position due to their preoccupation with immediate gratification.  This state of ignorance, Huxley argues, is a result of ideological manipulation, a point strikingly evident in the conditioning of the citizens of \"Brave New World.\" The lower social castes, designated as Delta, Gamma, and so on, lack genuine autonomy.  They are systematically conditioned through \"hypnopædia,\" a form of sleep learning, to crave consumption and material excess, ultimately serving the interests of the World Controller, the figurehead of this oppressive regime.\n\nThe novel illustrates the concept of \"hegemony,\" the dominance of a particular group over others, in a stark manner. The lower classes are kept oblivious to the machinations of those in power, essentially \"buying into\" an ideology that perpetuates the existing social and economic structures. Meanwhile, the upper classes, while aware of the system's inherent inequalities, remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions without challenge.\n\nThe absence of meaningful relationships in \"Brave New World\" further underscores Huxley's critique. Characters seem interchangeable, lacking depth and complexity. This superficiality, perhaps, reflects Huxley's belief that technological advancement and unchecked capitalism erode human connection and individuality. Love and genuine emotion are absent, replaced by superficial interactions driven by physical attraction and fleeting pleasure.\n\nThe citizens' unquestioning acceptance of their societal roles and the rigid hierarchy within \"Brave New World\" mirror Marxist theories about the proletariat's acceptance of their subjugation. They are reassured of their superiority as long as they remain compliant consumers, perpetuating the cycle of exploitation.",
            "My time as a student at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, or the equivalent of four and a half semesters.  Campus navigation poses a notable challenge for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at, arguably, the easternmost point of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.  Journeying from my East Halls home to classes located in more central areas, such as the Willard Building, could easily consume up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when contending with inclement weather, which is a frequent occurrence in State College.  Conversations with an alumnus, not much older than myself, revealed that a relatively recent past saw the East Halls dormitories separated from the main campus by vast tracts of undeveloped land. Today, this formerly vacant expanse has been transformed into a vibrant landscape of sports fields, expansive new structures including the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of residential apartments.  As our campus continues to expand, the task of traversing its sprawling grounds becomes increasingly complex.  What constitutes the most effective solution to this mobility dilemma?  In the context of a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer. However, the bicycle alone cannot provide a comprehensive solution; students must actively utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to cater to the needs of cyclists.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had recently returned to cycling after a multi-year hiatus prompted an intriguing observation.  He expressed surprise at his own lapse in cycling, stating, \"Bicycles are fantastic; for a period, it wasn't considered fashionable to ride one, but it's undoubtedly the most practical mode of transportation.\" Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling boasts remarkable efficiency as a means of travel. A modest meal of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel you a distance of 30 miles or more.  Similar to many undergraduates, I currently reside off campus, located a distance from the campus center comparable to that of some dormitories.  The most prudent decision I have made this year was acquiring a bicycle.  Daily, I attend classes in the Thomas Building, a location that entails a 25-minute walk from my residence.  Cycling can significantly reduce this travel time to a mere 5 minutes if I maintain a brisk pace. The primary obstacle lies in Pollock Road, which offers the most direct route to the Thomas Building from my home, but its condition can pose challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists alike.  While walking possesses its merits, my current schedule leaves little room for it.  Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole dependable option for reaching my classes.  Walking to Thomas daily would necessitate an additional 30-40 minutes per day, accumulating to over two and a half hours per week.  Factor in the time required for traversing to and from other classes, appointments, and various other commitments, and the total time commitment becomes unmanageable."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.

Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My aspiration to pursue a career in social work stems from a deep desire to contribute to the well-being of children who have endured abuse or neglect. I envision myself working within the Division of Family and Children Services, offering support to both vulnerable children and families grappling with challenges.  \n\nThe field of social work resonates deeply with my personal values: service, respect, ethical conduct, and a steadfast commitment to fostering positive relationships.  I believe these principles extend beyond the professional realm and are fundamental to living a meaningful life.\n\nMy journey toward this calling began with a lifelong inclination toward helping others.  During my academic years, I observed individuals grappling with adversity in various ways, some resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. These experiences fueled my initial pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009.  \n\nA pivotal moment occurred during a summer visit with a friend. I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment.  Witnessing his plight ignited a profound desire within me to make a tangible difference. Though the legal system was unable to intervene directly, I felt compelled to offer support. My background in psychology led me to engage with the boy's parents, attempting to understand their perspective and advocate for the child's well-being. This experience solidified my conviction that a career in social work would allow me to directly address the complex needs of children and families.\n\nAnother core value that drives my passion for social work is social justice.  I believe in the inherent worth of every individual and challenge societal norms that perpetuate inequality.  I have consistently advocated for social justice throughout my life, whether through personal expression, activism, or standing up against discrimination.

The biological model zeroes in on the influence of inherited genetic predispositions and physiological health factors on sleep patterns. Conversely, the sociocultural model investigates the impact of environmental influences, considering variables such as race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic standing.  This analysis critically reviews pertinent research within each model, elucidating the strengths and limitations of each study's findings.\n\nSleep disorders can manifest in various forms: primary sleep disorders, those secondary to other mental health conditions, or those arising from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders are categorized as either Dyssomnias or Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass a range of conditions like insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias. These conditions primarily affect the initiation and maintenance of sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities or physiological events during sleep, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and unspecified parasomnias. Sleep disorders linked to mental health often stem from Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, providing a comparative analysis of its relationship to both the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model posits that genes, inherited traits, and physiological factors contribute to the development of sleep disorders. Notably, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness.  A study utilizing mice models demonstrated the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically implicated in sleep-wake cycles. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition reduces anxiety and induces sleep.  Administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) resulted in increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009).  These findings suggest that findings from animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  \n\nPotential dysfunction or absence of this receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, possibly necessitating medication for adequate rest. From a sociocultural perspective, inherited variations in this receptor phenotype could influence sleep regulation.  Alterations in receptor function could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting various aspects of life such as academic performance, career success, and daily tasks requiring sustained attention and focus.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is elucidated, outlining common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the document concludes with strategies that educators in inclusive classroom settings can implement to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's effectiveness in utilizing auditory information. In essence, CAPD involves the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process sound input and the neurological activity underlying this process (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This signifies that individuals with CAPD may experience difficulties in accurately interpreting sounds despite possessing normal hearing abilities. The brain's region responsible for deciphering speech, distinguishing words, and segregating conversations from background noise may not function optimally.\n\nThe earliest documented instances of the condition, initially termed \"auditory imperception,\" emerged in the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers investigating children with communicative disorders were among the first to observe these auditory processing challenges. In 1954, an Italian research team composed of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of tests for children exhibiting these difficulties. Subsequently, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 further fueled research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways. Individuals with CAPD may struggle with sound localization, auditory discrimination, pattern recognition, and speech comprehension. They might have difficulty distinguishing between sounds, perceiving changes in speech intonation (e.g., sarcasm), or processing sequential auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves thorough observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and psychologists. These assessments may encompass questionnaires, behavioral observations, and specialized tests that evaluate various auditory-related skills. Notably, there is currently no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool, and the underlying cause of CAPD remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously and require them to identify specific sounds or sequences. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and analyzing the brain's responses to these signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex nature of disguise and its implications for self-discovery and interpersonal relationships. While acknowledging the potential for deception to be effective in the short term, the play ultimately suggests that individuals must confront their assumed identities to avoid becoming lost in the act of pretense.  However, revealing the truth can lead to alienation and strained connections.\n\nThe play presents a compelling dilemma: choosing between preserving one's authentic self and safeguarding existing relationships. Some might react neutrally to discovering they've been deceived, while others may harbor resentment and offense, further complicating matters.\n\nGender role reversal within the context of deception adds another layer of complexity.  A crucial question emerges: why would someone feel compelled to abandon their own identity and adopt the guise of the opposite gender?  In Viola's case, her decision stems from a need for self-preservation.  Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, she adopts the male persona of Cesario as a protective measure against potential threats: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nWhile her disguise proves effective, it simultaneously isolates her from the female community, depriving her of a vital support network.  Furthermore, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads Olivia to misidentify her as Sebastian and develop romantic feelings: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138).  Adding to the complexity, Viola grapples with suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nDespite its potentially progressive elements, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on how deception can illuminate hidden emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's assumed identity. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario driven by his perceived masculinity, or does it reflect a deeper, perhaps unconscious, inclination towards women?  \n\nIt's plausible that Olivia's character serves as a satire of those in Shakespeare's era who judge individuals solely based on appearances, as evidenced by her swift transition of affection from Cesario to Sebastian and her subsequent shift in perception of Cesario/Viola to one of familial regard: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule across its various territories has been subject to criticism, particularly concerning its actions in German South West Africa, where the Ovaherero and Nama people suffered a horrific genocide. However, it would be reductive to solely define the German colonial enterprise through such a lens.  The empire displayed a remarkable diversity in its governing strategies and policies, mirroring the vast geographical spread of its possessions. \n\nEducational initiatives undertaken within the colonies also demonstrated this variability. When Britain assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanzania) in 1919, they encountered a populace with a significant number of educated and literate individuals.  German educational endeavors in other colonies, such as Kamerun, were lauded by contemporary writers.\n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government actively established state schools and played a central role in educating the native population, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  Despite this, the government did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing state schools and providing substantial backing and oversight for missionary educational institutions.  These contrasting educational policies had enduring consequences for South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by formal education, with the vast majority of the population remaining illiterate.\n\nVarious social, political, and economic factors converged to create this divergent experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the native African population, drawing upon recent research in this area.\n\nExisting scholarship on education within the German colonial empire is extensive.  Most of these sources, primarily originating from the early twentieth century, were written in German and focus on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the colonies. Later works, predominantly in English, have expanded this discourse through comparative analyses of education across the various German colonies and in-depth examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies have highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies.\n\nThe seminal work directly addressing the subject of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and explores the factors contributing to their differences.  Cohen posits that the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining many of the unique characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, though much of its territory is characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has become incredibly intricate, encompassing a vast array of genres that are practically impossible to completely list. This complexity is further amplified by the fact that most, if not all, genres – encompassing styles like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk – have branched out into numerous subgenres and even sub-subgenres.\n\nWithin this expansive landscape, heavy metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the last forty years. Its expressiveness stems from its capacity to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though these often gravitate towards the darker end.  The genre's diversity is equally remarkable, as soon after its inception, artists began recognizing its inherent flexibility and began experimenting, giving rise to subgenres, which in turn spawned their own sub-subgenres, and so on, creating a continuous chain of evolution.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement finds itself at a point where its numerous niches make it challenging to definitively define what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from a multitude of other genres, yet, like any significant cultural phenomenon, it originated from a specific source. To truly comprehend the diverse tapestry of heavy metal music that permeates the contemporary scene, one must first delve into the origins of the movement itself, understanding its essence as a cultural force rather than merely a musical genre.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement deeply rooted in the exploration of darkness. It can be characterized as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. In contrast to earlier, more primitive forms, metal emphasizes technical proficiency; musicians in metal bands demonstrate exceptional skill and command over their instruments, a virtuosity that resonates throughout their music. Moreover, it's undeniable that metal has a strong connection to the influence of drugs. The psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s fueled a wave of experimentation, leading to the creation of unconventional and otherworldly music, often using drugs as a catalyst for artistic expression. \n\nIts dark, visceral qualities were groundbreaking in the music scene, as much of popular music at the time lacked a strong connection to the darker aspects of the human emotional experience. Later generations of metal musicians have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral aesthetics prevalent in the Romantic era. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this darkness: \n\n\"Helter Skelter\" showcases a darker side to the Beatles, with its chaotic and seemingly drug-induced imagery. This song is often cited as one of the earliest examples of heavy metal, serving as a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones track.  The Beatles sought to demonstrate their own capacity for intensity, including this song on their iconic \"The White Album.\"",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealism, a singular artist named Henri Rousseau was painstakingly constructing his own imaginative worlds, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\"  depicts not only a woman awestruck by the wonders of her dream-induced landscape but also reflects Rousseau's own aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and art enthusiasts.  However, this ambition presented him with a profound internal conflict: should he conform to prevailing painting styles to gain acceptance within the art world he deeply revered, or should he embrace creative independence and forge his own unique path? \"The Dream\" stands as a powerful testament to this lifelong struggle, encapsulating Rousseau's internal battle between conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully comprehend the layered meaning of \"The Dream,\" one must first delve into Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau's upbringing was far removed from the world of artistic refinement. His father, a tinsmith and hardware dealer, enjoyed a comfortable middle-class existence. Formal art training eluded Rousseau, who spent forty years working for the French government as a toll collector, despite being mistakenly labeled a customs inspector. The profound loss of his wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with a single daughter, Julia, and an overwhelming sense of grief.  In search of solace and renewal, Rousseau turned to painting as a means of finding comfort and embarking on a fresh chapter in his life. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the hopes and dreams of the ordinary working class.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for recognition within the art world can be understood in light of his unique circumstances.  He lacked formal training and began his artistic career relatively late in life, navigating a landscape dominated by established and celebrated artists.  While he had been painting for years, his work only gained significant attention around the time Matisse began making a name for himself. According to art historian Jan Gordon, despite being artistic competitors, Rousseau and Matisse differed not only in style and subject matter, but also in their motivations. Gordon states that while Matisse sought to avoid painting in a predictable or clichéd manner, Rousseau's ambition was to create such a conventional work that he would be admitted to the prestigious Artiste Français society (92).",
            "Throughout history, many influential thinkers have explored the profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental link between truth and beauty. This relationship resonates deeply, as poet John Keats eloquently expresses in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  While much of our understanding of the world stems from formal education or personal experiences, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics appears to transcend these conventional learning methods. Both disciplines, as Keats implies, function more as descriptions than prescriptive guides. Our investigations into morality and beauty primarily aim to decipher why a particular artwork or literary piece holds aesthetic value or why a certain action is deemed ethical, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral conduct.\n\nFurthermore, any critique of art or morality inevitably falls short of capturing the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty. For instance, a discussion about the merits of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might delve into elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context. However, these analytical tools ultimately fail to fully elucidate the reasons behind its artistic brilliance. When individuals are asked about their favorite works of art or literature, they often preface their explanations with phrases like \"There's just something about it,\" highlighting an elusive quality that transcends mere description.\n\nI believe that both art and morality possess an inherent characteristic that cannot be entirely reduced to a catalog of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor aptly stated, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how meticulously we dissect the components of a literary work, a transcendent element remains, a \"je ne sais quoi\" that defies complete articulation.\n\nThis intangible essence, I propose, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. It is this very quality that links them, as Wittgenstein suggests, stating: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"  \n\nI posit that this shared transcendental nature forms a crucial connection between ethics and aesthetics.\n\nMorality and art intertwine profoundly because we experience them most powerfully on a noumenal level, a concept borrowed from Kant's philosophy. They evoke an impact that can be felt but not fully comprehended through rational analysis. This connection becomes even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Contemporary Germany stands as a powerful nation, united and characterized by a distinct culture that stretches from the Bavarian Alps in München to the Baltic Sea port city of Kiel. This cultural tapestry is evident from Köln, situated along the Rhine River, to the heart of the country and the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled on the Elbe. Given this rich and varied cultural heritage, it is not surprising that modern Germany evolved from a confluence of diverse tribes and origins.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people is known as Germania. The etymology of this name remains a subject of debate among historians and scholars. The Roman historian Tacitus asserted that the name derived from a Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who, prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls, were known by a different name. (Tacitus, 98) Julius Caesar, in his writings on the Gallic Wars, was the first to employ the term \"Germanus.\" In his account of his campaigns against the Gauls and his encounters with Germanic tribes frequently crossing the Rhine, Caesar adopted the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those who remained unconquered. Some scholars suggest that the term \"Germanus\" originated from a neighboring people in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter of the first book of his Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (the Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC)  Alternatively, others propose that the name derives from the spear used in Germanic warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning \"to shout,\" which might allude to the perceived loud and boisterous nature of the Germans. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" which delves into the origins of the Germans, wrote: \"I should regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would leave the Roman heartland for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not at that time, at least. They ventured into the lands of Germania for trade and occasionally launched military campaigns, but ultimately, they primarily returned to their vast empire. Consequently, as Germanic tribes emerged in the middle of the first century AD, they resided on the periphery of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods derived from their lands and offering their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army.

            "My gaze drifted downward, my thoughts a silent, unmoving sea. I observed the scene before me with a detached focus, analyzing each detail without allowing it to truly register. Ideas flickered in and out of my consciousness, fleeting and inconsequential. My mind operated with a mechanical precision, devoid of genuine emotion or reflection.\n\nYears ago, inspired by an artist I once collaborated with, I bought a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" The desire to draw had been with me since childhood, and this book promised to unlock the secrets of artistic perception. It delved into the intricate ways our brains interpret lines and shapes, even suggesting techniques like framing a picture within an imaginary square to simplify complex compositions.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at the object before me, I couldn't summon the artist's perspective. Overwhelmed by its presence, I could only stand and absorb its essence. Artistic giants like Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters had all found their signature styles: a blue phase, a love for greens, a riot of colors.  This, I thought, was my beginning, the genesis of my own artistic journey. I envisioned a piece titled \"Work in Brown,\" a testament to the raw, unfiltered experience before me.\n\nMy fingers instinctively reached for my chosen tool, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, guided by an intangible internal force. This could be the dawn of creation, the birth of something truly unique. Water swirled serenely, a crystal-clear mirror reflecting the world around it. Fragments detached, carried away on the current.\n\nBut the moment shattered. My hand, now trembling with a nervous energy, slammed the toilet handle again. The stubborn object remained, stubbornly clinging to the porcelain.\n\nMy grip tightened on the mop, my feet planted firmly on the ground. A green tie felt like a noose around my neck. I frowned, my gaze fixed on the unwelcome deposit someone had left behind. A message, perhaps, for those who cleaned these public spaces. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand moved towards the wall, reaching for the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand, transforming it into a makeshift mitt.\n\nWith a final, decisive movement, I plunged my hand into the bowl, mimicking the gesture of a mother tending to a roast in the oven.",
            "Young individuals are facing a dangerous reality behind the wheel.  Several converging factors contribute to the alarming statistic of fatalities among the youngest drivers.  Research from the National Institutes of Health highlights that the adolescent brain is not fully developed for the complexities of driving.  Inexperience, a fundamental element in this issue, not only leads to a higher frequency of fatal accidents but also increases the likelihood of rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road.  \n\nFurthermore, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly amplifies these risks. Studies conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, for example, demonstrate a direct correlation between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.  \n\nIn an effort to mitigate these dangers, some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing programs for teenagers. These programs restrict driving hours and prohibit younger passengers. However, in my view, these measures are merely temporary solutions.  The core problem lies in the fact that, statistically, young drivers, as a group, lack the maturity and capabilities to adequately handle the inherent risks and responsibilities of operating a motor vehicle.  Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, a renowned psychologist, even argues that the age of 18 is too young for a full driver's license. His research suggests that individuals under the age of 19-20 possess a heightened inclination towards risk-taking behavior driven by a desire for thrills.  Therefore, delaying driving until this impulsive tendency diminishes seems prudent. \n\nFailure to address this issue will undoubtedly result in continued tragedies on our roads, with the potential for a catastrophic increase in fatalities in the coming years.  As the \"Millennials,\" the children of the Baby Boomer generation, reach driving age, millions of new young drivers will be entering the driving pool.  \n\nNational legislation aimed at this problem is feasible and, I believe, essential.  Schools could continue to provide driver's education, but no one under 18 should be permitted to operate a vehicle.  Provisional permits could still be issued prior to granting full licenses, and practical driving training hours, possibly based on the current requirements in most states (such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice), would remain a necessity.  Given that the alarming statistics involving teen drivers are consistent across the nation, uniform, nationwide legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to safeguard young people across the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not an unprecedented concept.",
            "During my exploration of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to analyze all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily rely on ingenious editing techniques to create visual illusions. My research centered around describing the stylistic elements common to most of these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics present in a select few later productions. \n\nThe typical trick film from this era tends to be confined to a static set within a frontal proscenium. It features a stationary camera, long and medium shots, and adheres strictly to the principle of one camera shot equating to one complete film. However, there are a handful of early twentieth-century films that challenge these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA striking characteristic shared by most trick films is their filming within an enclosed set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed in this position, never panning or tracking to follow characters or objects. This compositional approach, common in early cinema,  draws inspiration from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic performances.  One inherent limitation of this stage-bound approach is that characters in trick films primarily move side-to-side, lacking the ability to approach or recede from the camera.  Consider, for example, the action in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even when exiting the frame, the camera does not follow their movements.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots tend to be long shots, occasionally interspersed with medium shots. Close-up shots are entirely absent in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This stylistic choice mirrors the theatrical tradition where the audience views the entire performance at once, framed by the stage boundaries. As actors typically remain in the middle ground and do not advance towards the camera, close-up shots are rendered unnecessary.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films follow a pattern where one conceptual shot corresponds to an entire film. This limitation restricts the length of most trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic scope of these films; most focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and substitutions, with minimal storytelling. It's important to note that in a trick film, a conceptual shot perceived by the viewer may not necessarily equal a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might actually involve several segments spliced together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Examine \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals the precise moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, a prominent figure in the early Republican movement, emerged from the world of agriculture, a profession that, coupled with his brief foray into politics, shaped his enduring commitment to individual liberty and a limited government. His unwavering dedication to an agrarian society formed the bedrock of his political convictions, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system. \n\nTaylor saw in the nascent United States a unique opportunity to establish an ideal government, unburdened by the constraints of pre-existing traditions. He believed that the nation's founding presented a chance to craft a system of self-governance firmly rooted in the inherent rights of man. These rights, he argued, were interconnected, inseparable, and indispensable. He asserted that any infringement upon one right would jeopardize the entire fabric of individual liberty, diminishing the value of the remaining rights.  \n\nTo ensure the preservation of these rights, Taylor maintained that the government must remain strictly circumscribed. He envisioned a society where individuals could flourish, free from government overreach. He believed that history demonstrated a tendency for those with physical strength and cunning to exploit the weak in a \"state of nature.\" However, in a civilized society, this imbalance must be rectified through a system that protected the vulnerable.\n\nTaylor's vision of an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the inherent good and evil within humanity. He adhered to a strict dualistic morality, asserting that all actions of government, by their very nature, reflected the complexities of human character.  He defined \"good\" principles as those that safeguarded private property, promoted agricultural prosperity, and tempered the excesses of capitalism. In his view, a government founded on these principles would ensure equitable outcomes regardless of the individuals who held power, as human nature inevitably led to self-interest and ambition.\n\nWhile Taylor recognized the inevitability of human self-interest, he distinguished between its expression within the context of the common good and its potential to undermine it. He argued that self-interest, when channeled toward the betterment of society, was a force for progress. However, when it transcended the pursuit of the public good and led to the exploitation of others, it became a destructive force. A strong government, he believed, was essential to curb these negative tendencies, but even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the adoption of corrupting influences.\n\nLike many of his fellow Republicans, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a limited federal government, with powers explicitly enumerated within its text. He believed that an expansive federal government, burdened by its own complexity, was susceptible to tyranny. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, arguing that understanding the intent of the framers was crucial to prevent misinterpretations and abuses of power.\n\nTaylor held the Declaration of Independence as the nation's true founding document, emphasizing its articulation of the United States as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a single, unified nation.",
            "The analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This decline was unexpected and the contributing factors remain unclear.  \n\nSeveral potential explanations exist.  The onset of winter, particularly on a New England campus, could have reduced the number of individuals commuting by bicycle or foot. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity and final preparations for the holiday break.  During this time, completing a commuter log might have become less of a priority for many. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for both students and faculty, during which campus visits are often minimal.  The low number of submissions in January could be attributed to the post-holiday period and the adjustment back to the academic schedule. \n\nHowever, the continued low submission rate in February is more perplexing. One could speculate that any new initiative experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm followed by a natural decline in participation.  To counter this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a concentrated effort to revitalize the program.  This strategy proved successful, resulting in an increase in log submissions for that month. \n\nOne of the primary challenges encountered was maintaining project momentum, both in the face of anticipated engagement fluctuations and the unique scheduling constraints inherent in the higher education environment.  \n\nAnother challenge common to alternative commuting initiatives is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle autonomy.  To incentivize participation, we offered a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses and national retailers. While these incentives proved effective,  it is intriguing to consider the potential impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid, or electric vehicles.  The consistent prize structure throughout the project may have contributed to the observed decline in engagement.\n\nA dynamic prize system, with increasing value over time, could have potentially stimulated greater participation.  For instance, announcing the addition of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January might have encouraged a more sustained level of engagement.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, much like index funds.  However, ETFs offer greater flexibility as they trade on stock exchanges, similar to individual shares. This structure provides investors with the diversification benefits of index funds along with the advantages associated with owning individual stocks, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractional shares.\n\nWhile ETFs present enticing benefits, including lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds, it's crucial to be aware of potential drawbacks.  For instance, trading ETFs typically involves brokerage commissions, just like stock trades.  Furthermore, the wide range of available ETFs necessitates careful evaluation to determine if their advertised benefits, such as diversification, are truly realized and to what extent.\n\nThis analysis focuses on examining the IHF ETF and comparing its performance to its ten largest holdings.  The aim is to assess whether owning the ETF provides comparable benefits to owning a diversified portfolio of these ten individual stocks.  We will also explore the possibility of optimizing returns or risk (measured by the Sharpe ratio) through alternative configurations of these holdings.\n\nGiven the extensive number of holdings within the ETF, this investigation concentrates on the top ten holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  These holdings are listed below, along with their respective percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge how effectively these ten stocks represent the overall performance of the IHF ETF, we can leverage their current asset allocation percentages.  By normalizing these percentages to 100%, we can calculate the contribution of each stock to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were composed solely of these ten stocks, mirroring the ETF's holdings structure.  The calculated beta and return values are presented in the subsequent chart.\n\nThe data in the chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings could potentially generate a 6.11% higher return compared to the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer a higher return with lower risk.  However, it is essential to determine whether these differences between the two portfolios are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finest poems. Within this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines 6 and 56, a word traced back to Virgil by scholar H.L. Mencken. Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost boundary of the known world. While Virgil's use is undeniable, a more contemporary source deserves recognition. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nThis particular reference highlights Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe's work might be inspired by Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe's death in 1832.  A short poem within the second part of \"Faust\" is titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem centers on a king who, after his wife gifts him a goblet before her passing, becomes consumed by grief and excessive drinking.  Ultimately, he decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children, save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thulé and the portrayal of the king in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, potentially reflecting Poe's own experiences with loss and the solace he sought in alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe used the term \"Thulé\" in his work \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe utilizes the term \"Thulé\" twice in his written works. While he references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the term \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thulé as dark and desolate, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color, mirroring the emotional state of the King of Thulé from Goethe's poem who, grieving his wife's loss, is consumed by loneliness and a loss of purpose.\n\nGoethe's significance would have made him a familiar figure to Poe, particularly through his admiration for another poet, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.  Poe's regard for Tennyson was well-documented. Beyond this connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's works through numerous reproductions that circulated after the original publications.",
            "The legal question at hand concerns the potential for punitive damages in a slip-and-fall case under California law. Specifically, could a customer injured due to an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages if evidence suggests the store manager acted with malice?\n\nA judge would likely not immediately dismiss a punitive damages claim in a situation like this. To justify such an award, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were not merely negligent, but rather exhibited a willful and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result.  Furthermore, the conduct must be deemed \"despicable,\" meaning it evinces a profound lack of moral decency.\n\nIn this instance, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, could argue that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have been aware of the potential danger posed by the uncleaned spill. Previous incidents of slip-and-falls within the store, including multiple instances in the months leading up to Palmer's accident, could be presented as evidence of a pattern of negligence. Despite this knowledge, Martin allegedly failed to address the spill, choosing instead to prioritize his dinner break.\n\nWhile the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less straightforward, it could still hold weight given the documented history of similar incidents. The plaintiff's case might be strengthened by highlighting the six slip-and-fall events that occurred in 2009 alone, suggesting a systemic disregard for customer safety.\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows: On October 13, 2009, at approximately 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin reportedly dismissed the concern, stating he was on dinner break and had no time for \"customer complaints.\"  Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also alerted Martin to the spill, receiving the same dismissive response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the uncleaned spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to this incident, five other slip-and-falls had been reported at the store throughout 2009.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded in cases involving breaches of duty, even those not arising from contracts, if the defendant's actions demonstrate \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\"  The legal definition of malice in this context encompasses conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and involves a \"willful and conscious disregard\" for the rights or safety of others. \n\nCourts have interpreted \"malice\" as involving a conscious disregard for a plaintiff's rights when a defendant, aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions, deliberately chooses to ignore those risks.",
            "During my time at CBC, I delved into the complexities of Islam in a course that sparked fervent debate. A recurring theme was the nature of Islam itself – is it inherently hostile? This question resonates even more strongly today, given the evolving perceptions of Islam in the aftermath of 9/11.  I've witnessed a shift in media portrayals, transitioning from a largely adversarial stance towards Islam and its adherents to an atmosphere of amplified acceptance.  It's hard to imagine a scenario prior to 2001 where a presidential candidate with a background like Barack Obama's, with his evident Muslim lineage, could have even been considered.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography presents a fascinating paradox. My initial understanding, shaped by historical narratives, painted a picture of a forceful leader who subjugated tribes and compelled them to convert to Islam. However, the biography portrays Muhammad in a different light – as a figure of quiet resilience, misunderstood and even self-effacing. It suggests that individuals gradually embraced his teachings, drawn to the inherent truth they perceived.\n\nIntriguingly, parallels exist between the ministry of Jesus and the narratives surrounding Muhammad's miracles.  One striking example is the story of his provision of sustenance – multiplying meager offerings of mutton and milk to feed a multitude. This literary style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, one whose authenticity resided not in ostentatious displays but in his unwavering commitment to truth. This approach, however, risks minimizing the extraordinary nature of Jesus Christ's miracles. It feels, in a way, like an attempt to borrow from the legacy of Jesus and imbue Muhammad with a similar grandeur.\n\nFurthermore, many stories within the biography appear designed to bolster the notion of voluntary conversions to Islam. However, the reliance on third-party accounts, where information is relayed through a chain of intermediaries, weakens their impact. While the intention may have been to provide irrefutable proof, this reliance on hearsay casts a shadow of doubt, making the narratives appear less credible.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divinely inspired figure – humble, compassionate, wise, and gentle. This idealized portrayal clashes with historical accounts that depict a more complex and sometimes ruthless individual. It compels me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the historical realities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought after Jesus' lifetime diverged significantly from his original teachings.  Examining this trajectory reveals a gradual shift in Christianity, moving further from its roots.  Our contemporary world, marked by a heightened awareness and progressive inclination,  witnesses a growing divide between traditional viewpoints and evolving perspectives. While those clinging to established doctrines may resist change, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the broader Christian landscape. \n\nLooking ahead, a deeper historical understanding is likely to emerge within Christianity, fostering a desire to discern the doctrines that have accumulated over time from Jesus' core message. This process, though potentially spanning decades or even centuries, will inevitably lead to a reversal in the historical trend.  A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of accumulated doctrine, akin to rewinding a clock, ultimately revealing a purer conception of Jesus' original teachings.\n\nAs this movement gains traction in nations like the United States and Europe,  it will inspire widespread adherence to Jesus' original ideas, mirroring the era of his ministry.  While the institutional church will likely remain a powerful force, the theological landscape will experience a significant shift. The current diversity within Christendom will gradually converge towards greater uniformity in belief and practice.  Boundaries between regions, denominations, and factions will blur, leading to increasing similarities.\n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals.  The transition of the Roman Empire from persecutor of Christians to a predominantly Christian institution stands as a testament to this phenomenon. Similarly, the United States witnessed a profound shift from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The impending reversion within Christianity will likely follow a similar pattern, retracing its steps to its origins and diminishing existing diversity.\n\nA key factor enabling this transformation will be a reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal.  This raises the question: what transpired between Jesus' lifetime and the present day?  \n\nTracing back through history, we encounter Judaism, the theological foundation upon which Christianity was built.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established its core tenets: monotheism, divinely revealed scriptures, and the authority of the Hebrew Bible. However, this religious landscape was not monolithic.  Various factions, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace, coexisted within the Jewish community.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" offers a stark portrayal of human nature, revealing a tendency towards self-preservation and a disregard for those deemed less fortunate. The novel vividly depicts this through the actions of factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit above all else. They are depicted as relentless in their pursuit of expansion, indifferent to the human and environmental costs of their endeavors.  Sinclair utilizes powerful imagery to highlight the damage inflicted by these industrial giants. Describing the factories as \"clear-cut and black against the sky,\" with \"great chimneys\" spewing smoke into the distance, he emphasizes the bleak and oppressive environment. This industrial landscape, fueled by the relentless pursuit of wealth, ignores the well-being of both workers and the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nThe novel further exposes the callous treatment of employees. Driven by greed, the owners exploit their workforce, subjecting them to grueling hours and unsafe conditions.  As Sinclair writes, the workplace is characterized by \"jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  The fragility of worker lives is underscored by the threat of sudden layoffs, leaving individuals without income or support.  The absence of labor protections during this era allows the owners to operate with impunity, further exacerbating the plight of the working class.  \n\nEven the unions, intended to provide a voice for the workers, are depicted as corrupt and ineffective, exacerbating the workers' vulnerability. The novel poignantly compares the workers' plight to slavery, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of their exploitation.  Sinclair argues that in this system, where survival hinges on the whims of uncaring employers, \"immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Certain literary techniques allow authors to guide the reader's emotional response to pivotal themes.  \n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald demonstrates mastery of these techniques in his novel, _The Great Gatsby_. He often juxtaposes adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to evoke a specific atmosphere. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning, strategically employing them to reinforce thematic resonance. Colors, in particular, serve as potent symbols in his work, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout _The Great Gatsby_, Fitzgerald carefully constructs meaning around these colors, ultimately using them to trigger specific emotional responses in the reader when encountering significant objects.\n\nWhite and gray, for instance, are imbued with the meaning of uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated status, while gray connotes an aged and faded quality. Fitzgerald establishes this duality early in the novel with a pervasive presence of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually clad in \"white\" (8), and this sartorial choice extends to other characters as well: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only exception to this white-dominated color scheme occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). \n\nFitzgerald further solidifies the meaning associated with these colors by applying them to commonplace objects and locations. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). At Gatsby's parties, the names on Nick's timetable become \"gray names\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a visual representation of uniformity (28). Even ordinary people and places are rendered in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is described as \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established a clear connection between white/gray and a sense of unimportance or uniformity, Fitzgerald employs these colors to characterize certain subjects, beginning with Daisy. After a prolonged absence, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74). This sudden reintroduction of these colors subtly shifts the reader's perception of Daisy, diminishing her individuality and transforming her into a more uniform object of desire, something Gatsby craves. Fitzgerald reinforces this notion throughout the narrative. We see a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and later, she is again depicted in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County thrives due to its pleasant, sunny climate, yielding a diverse range of crops. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers are among the common produce.  There's a noticeable demand for organically grown food, particularly through community supported agriculture (CSA) programs, with many local organizations experiencing extensive waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also popular choices in the area. Numerous organic farms offer engaging tours of their operations, along with opportunities for recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of farm model presents a unique opportunity for landowners to benefit from government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality. This can be achieved through sustainable farming practices that promote wildlife, offer educational programs, and create avenues for generating income. \n\nBeyond catering to a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often promotes greater biodiversity in both plant and animal life. This is a result of the absence of chemical inputs in the soil and water. However, organic farming practices come with certain challenges. Labor-intensive methods are required for pest and weed control, soil fertilization, and overall management, often leading to higher costs and potentially greater crop losses compared to conventional farming. Additionally, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nPractices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also increase labor costs.  These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or open ground patches. Given these complexities, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profitability and habitat conservation.\n\nThe chosen land for this example is a 160-acre parcel located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  This property consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion designated in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This plan, currently under review, identifies over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining. These include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, along with burrowing owls, which are also at risk.\n\nThis region has a rich history, inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This specific land parcel was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo illustrate the potential of sustainable farming practices on this land, I researched available government programs and their potential benefits for small farmers looking to mitigate costs while preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  For a real-world example, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The influence of cultural factors on negotiation processes cannot be understated.  Culture, a complex and multifaceted concept, is defined as much by its absences as its presences and symbolic meanings. It's crucial to recognize that culture is not monolithic; it lacks homogeneity and uniformity.  Overgeneralizations, such as claiming \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently reductive and fail to capture the nuances of diverse cultural expressions. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a more effective approach for negotiators involves delving deeper into the specific significance of a culture within the context of the negotiation. Understanding how a culture's values and perspectives might shape interactions at the bargaining table is paramount.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, individuals often draw comparisons based on their own cultural lenses.   comprehending another culture's mindset requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing the study of its historical context, social norms, and potential biases. Rather than imposing judgments or attempting to alter a culture, negotiators should strive for acceptance and adaptation.  Working within the established cultural boundaries, particularly when holding a weaker bargaining position, is essential. Similarly, demonstrating respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territories can facilitate smoother negotiations and bridge cultural divides.\n\nIt's important to note that cultural influences extend beyond national borders. Corporate entities often cultivate their own distinct cultures, shaping employee behaviors and interactions. This can manifest in aspects like work hours, dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), delegation practices, and even philanthropic initiatives.  The diversity of corporate cultures within a single nation, as exemplified by the variations within American companies, underscores the richness and complexity of cultural expression within a society. While some cultures may appear more cohesive from an outsider's perspective, this often masks underlying layers of diversity.\n\nValues serve as the bedrock of a culture, providing the rationale behind its beliefs and behaviors. For instance, in cultures where saving face or communal harmony is highly valued, negotiators are less likely to publicly criticize their company or superiors to achieve a favorable outcome. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that prioritize aggressive bargaining tactics may be less inclined to settle quickly. Understanding these cultural values beforehand can significantly inform negotiation strategies. However, personalizing the approach by learning about individual negotiators can further enhance effectiveness.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" is famously found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. This very quote serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief also appears to resonate with another prominent author we'll be examining, Thomas Aquinas.  \n\nGiven that both arguments aim to defend the same concept – the existence of God – and our task is to determine which is more compelling, we'll simplify our analysis by assuming, for the sake of brevity, that both Anselm and Aquinas believe in the God described within the Bible. To ensure a fair comparison, we'll focus on their arguments within the context of this specific God-figure, as any deviation from this framework would hinder a meaningful assessment.\n\nWhile both thinkers present valid points, neither, in my view, offers a truly comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nLet's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the pursuit of understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God lies within the individual's own introspection. He argues that because God exists within our comprehension, we cannot logically conceive of his nonexistence. While his articulation of this concept can be somewhat dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the evidence for God's existence resides within the very fabric of our minds. Anselm proposes that we needn't seek external validation; the truth about God is found by examining what we inherently know to be true within our own consciousness. This reliance on internal conviction, lacking irrefutable empirical evidence, is often referred to as faith within Christian teachings.\n\nThis perspective starkly contrasts with that of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas maintains that the existence of God can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, rendering faith superfluous. This approach would undoubtedly be advantageous for evangelism, a crucial aspect of Christianity, as it would allow for the conversion of new believers without requiring them to accept something beyond empirical verification.\n\nAquinas elaborates on five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the logical necessity for God's existence is inherent in the universe. Imagine, for instance, you are assembling a puzzle and realize you are missing a piece. Even without seeing it, logic dictates that the missing piece must exist and possess specific characteristics based on the completed puzzle.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future leader, later known as Buddha, was born. His life journey involved forsaking worldly possessions and attaining enlightenment, ultimately leading to the establishment of Buddhism. The oldest branch of this faith, Theravada Buddhism, is approximately 2,500 years old. Over time, its practices and interpretations have evolved, as evidenced by the annual water-cutting ceremony in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning such a ritual, both monks and lay believers participate, signifying its religious importance. These changes extend beyond outward customs to the very heart of the faith's doctrines.  Both monastic and lay communities within Theravada Buddhism have adapted their core beliefs over centuries, influenced by a blend of internal and external factors, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently utilize specific terms to clarify its focus.  \"Internal forces\" refer to influences originating from individuals within the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. Conversely, \"external forces\" stem from non-Buddhists. \"Hostile forces\" are those aiming to harm or negatively impact the Buddhist community, driven by misconceptions or prejudice. \"Benign forces,\" while not necessarily intending to aid or hinder Buddhism, may inadvertently have both positive or negative consequences as a byproduct.  These terms will be recurring throughout the analysis.\n\nA fundamental understanding of Theravada Buddhism requires exploring its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these truths is essential for ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continuously perpetuates.  Simultaneously, relinquishing Sansara will alleviate lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes guidelines for conduct. Lay Buddhists adhere to five precepts:  abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Monks, in addition, follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the core of Buddhist thought lies the Four Noble Truths.  First, Dukkha: life involves suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The historical relationship between the United States and Mexico offers a compelling example of a longstanding rivalry.  This period of tension, which lasted approximately half a century, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145), reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.  In this conflict, the United States emerged victorious, annexing territories such as Texas and the American Southwest.  While the war marked a significant escalation, numerous smaller clashes punctuated their interactions over the years, ultimately subsiding prior to the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThis pattern of rivalry between neighboring nations is not unique.  Shared borders often lead to competitions over resources and conflicting interests, fostering strained relations.  The United States and Mexico exemplify this dynamic, mirroring other instances of enduring rivalries between geographically proximate countries.  As David M. Pletcher (1977) observes, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations, situated in close proximity to the United States, have historically presented diplomatic challenges, contrasting with the generally amicable relations the United States has maintained with other Latin American countries.\n\nReligious differences also served as a catalyst for friction between the two nations, a recurring theme throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86).  Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which encompassed both ideological and pragmatic dimensions, the U.S.-Mexico dynamic involved a complex interplay of religious beliefs and perceived national interests. This distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, legacies that hampered the establishment of harmonious relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period.  The majority of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including cross-border banditry and frontier skirmishes (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). Border incursions by outlaws and bandits from American border towns posed a significant challenge, persisting until both nations deployed military forces along their shared frontier (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) suggests, the intensity of the rivalry diminished as Mexico's growing dependence on the United States became apparent (p. 109). Ultimately, the shift in American ambitions from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico during the late 19th century marked the end of the rivalry (p.110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, my life took an unexpected turn. I was stricken by an illness, one I had never encountered before, leaving me disabled and unable to continue my work as a nurse. \n\nNursing hadn't been my initial aspiration. As a child, I craved stability and security, something my upbringing lacked. The constant reassurance that \"nursing is always in demand\" echoed in my ears, leading me to this profession despite my true passions for science and journalism. \n\nAt 46, unmarried, with limited savings, and facing a future of uncertainty, I found myself reliant on Social Security Disability. Fifteen years later, my resources are depleted, and every day presents a challenge to my well-being and sense of self.  \n\nDespite the hardships, I'm acutely aware that I wouldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. Their assistance has been invaluable, proving that even in the face of adversity, human connection is paramount.\n\nLife, as we know, is unpredictable. We can plan, we can prepare, but some challenges are simply too immense to overcome alone.\n\nWhile I agree that reducing our dependence on government is essential, I believe fostering a sense of community and mutual support is equally crucial.  \n\nWe should focus on rebuilding trust and interconnectedness, helping each other navigate life's storms rather than isolating ourselves in self-reliance. \n\nAmerican history often emphasizes \"rugged individualism,\" but it was compassion, respect, and shared resources that truly sustained our nation's pioneers. The wagon trains traversing the Rockies didn't succeed by going it alone; they relied on collective strength and mutual aid.\n\nTherefore, while preparedness is wise, let's not forget the importance of human connection.  Besides stocking up on essentials like a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and canned goods, invest in your community. Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and create a network of support that will see you through life's inevitable challenges.",
            "The mechanisms driving the evolution of organisms and the factors that influence their developmental trajectories remain fascinating areas of inquiry.  Despite advancements in mathematical modeling,  fully comprehending the intricacies of organic forms remains a significant challenge, as aptly highlighted by D’Arcy Thompson in 1917.  Recent research has explored the application of mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk skeletal development,  including its ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our current study investigates the potential of combining mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in the genus *Prunum* with experimental analyses to unravel the underlying mechanisms governing the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental transformations.\n\nUtilizing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantitative parameters that could be incorporated into a mathematical model to simulate both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then utilized in the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to generate models of potential shell forms,  allowing us to explore the boundaries of morphological variation within this group. The findings from these models are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to deepen our understanding of macroevolutionary processes within the *Prunum* lineage.\n\nThe structure of a shell can be conceptualized as a tube traversing a three-dimensional space over a 360-degree arc. These rotations or turns, known as whorls, encircle an imaginary central axis, termed the columella, which extends through the shell's central column. The rate of whorl enlargement can vary, with a continuous line separating each whorl, referred to as a suture. Typically, the largest whorl in a shell is the terminal whorl, also known as the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the opposite end designated as the base.  The animal emerges from the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views.  The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves initially viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the beginning of the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two sections.  Whorls are counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell can be visualized as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, a trajectory can be established.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically.  Once a mathematical formulation is developed, parameters can be adjusted to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The mortality rates for newborns and infants in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. Despite Indonesia's progress towards achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in areas like water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have unfortunately fallen short of the necessary targets to reach the 2015 goals.  A closer examination of the factors contributing to these shortcomings reveals a critical need to prioritize strengthening the overall health system rather than solely relying on isolated program-based interventions.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed improvements in the percentage of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications during pregnancy, which explains the significant number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage.  Therefore, while this indicator demonstrates some progress, it's crucial to recognize that it presents a somewhat skewed picture and significant work remains to be done.  Furthermore, there's been a concerning decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases among children under five years old that are treated by healthcare professionals. Although data regarding postnatal care is incomplete, it's evident that this area requires urgent attention, with low utilization rates observed across the nation.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than anticipated, hovering around 4%.  These rates also highlight another pressing issue: accessibility disparities within the healthcare system. While the cesarean-section rate stands at 7% in urban areas, it drops to a mere 2% in rural regions. This stark difference underscores the uneven distribution of healthcare services, with urban centers receiving a disproportionate share.  The issue of equitable access extends to vertical equity as well, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. This disparity strongly suggests that impoverished individuals face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, addressing Indonesia's neonatal and maternal care indicators requires a fundamental question: how to best address the existing service gaps. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or focus on bolstering the overall health system without singling out prenatal and postnatal care for mothers and children?  While program-specific solutions might appear appealing, offering more focused, manageable objectives and potentially faster results, they present certain drawbacks.  Concentrating resources on a single health sector often leads to neglect in other areas, diverting human resources towards programs with greater funding. The impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning programs serves as a prime example.  Furthermore, implementing multiple parallel programs for a single issue can result in duplication of services and a lack of coordination, ultimately increasing administrative burdens and hindering efficiency.",
            "Victorian novels are often known for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the lives of the aristocratic class during that era. However, there are some notable exceptions to this trend. Two such novels, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" while still classified as Victorian, diverge from this conventional path. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, characteristics less common in novels of the time. This unique approach enriches the character development, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\":\n“And now, a flood of bewildering and confusing ideas overwhelmed him. It felt as if he were still caught between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument; their words echoed in his ears.  When he finally managed to regain his focus, he found himself unexpectedly speaking to them. Suddenly, he jumped back at the sound of gunfire.  Shouts and cries erupted, lights flashed before his eyes, and chaos engulfed him as an unseen force swiftly carried him away. Throughout these rapid visions, a persistent, unsettling awareness of pain gnawed at him, tormenting him relentlessly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels frequently utilize mystery, often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and content vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal glimpses into Oliver's inner world, exposing his vulnerabilities and his understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him.  When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in Chapter 28, he relives the traumatic event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help (see left). The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire state of his health, which is evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him; his senses are numbed as he fails to notice the “unseen hand” that carries him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, now replaced by a constant and gnawing fear.  Oliver's overwhelming experience raises questions about the forces that have brought about his misfortune, as it is clearly not his own doing. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little agency in his life, unable to exert any control over the outcome of events, even when his life is in jeopardy. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this passage, as if Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own survival.\n\n“The day passed – day? It was gone as soon as it arrived – and night came again; a night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with young students at an after-school program. My primary focus was providing academic support, and I found myself particularly adept at assisting with English and reading comprehension.  One student, a young boy named Adrian, who I believe was in either third or fourth grade, presented a unique challenge. He struggled significantly with reading, exhibiting a peculiar pattern.  Some letters he pronounced flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him.  It was quite unusual.  While he clearly had a Latino background, his spoken English was impeccable.\n\nInitially, we faced considerable difficulties.  However, a turning point arrived when Adrian's mother came to the program.  With most of the other students on a field trip, I was essentially providing impromptu childcare for a few stragglers when she arrived.  She didn't speak a word of English, communicating solely in Spanish.  My own Spanish skills were rudimentary, as I was just beginning to learn the language, but we managed to establish a basic understanding. It was then that a significant realization struck me: Adrian wasn't necessarily struggling to read, but rather, he wasn't fully familiar with the English alphabet.\n\nWhether this revelation ultimately proved helpful, I can't say for certain, but I sincerely hope Adrian has made progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the pervasive issue of language barriers within our schools, particularly in California. It also serves as a reminder that challenges can often be more nuanced than they initially appear. Even for a child who speaks fluent English, reading can present substantial obstacles. \n\nThe existence of this problem is undeniable, so the question becomes, what can we do to address it? For Adrian, a relatively straightforward solution was tutoring him in English reading, specifically focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who have limited English proficiency, the solutions are far more complex and multifaceted.\n\nThere is no single panacea. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes, each offer valuable approaches, but none are inherently superior.\n\nThe key lies in a comprehensive and integrated approach, combining these various methods strategically.\n\nDual language programs, for instance, offer tremendous potential not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research has consistently demonstrated that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their monolingual peers academically.  Despite this evidence, there are widespread misconceptions that such programs are a waste of resources and that they primarily benefit a select group of students.  This notion is simply false.\n\nIf we were to embrace these programs as the norm rather than the exception, the educational benefits would be realized across the board.\n\nHow can we achieve this?  Mandating bilingualism for all teachers would be impractical and unrealistic.  However,  I firmly believe that employing specialized bilingual aides or tutors, regardless of their title, is a highly feasible and beneficial strategy.",
            "From our earliest years, many of us are instilled with the idea of something larger than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some seek answers in organized religion, attending Sunday school or temple, while others delve within for their own truths.  Often, we inherit the beliefs of our families, accepting them as our own.  However, some reject these teachings entirely, embracing a purely personal worldview, convinced that their own experiences constitute the entirety of existence. Our values may shift and evolve over time, leading us on a quest to define our individual sense of spirituality.  We yearn for a guiding light, a beacon to navigate the darkness and illuminate our path.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father said, his voice soft as we sat on the porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop. We shared a cigarette, the air thick with smoke and the scent of petrichor. Water cascaded from the overflowing gutters, drenching the plants lining the porch edge.  He gazed out into the downpour, his eyes distant, as if lost in a world beyond the immediate.  His frame was thinner now, his clothes hanging loosely on his emaciated frame. His hair, once a full head, had thinned, leaving patches of bare scalp exposed. He avoided my gaze, his eyes fixed on the relentless rain. A wave of loneliness and fear washed over me, silencing my words.  How could I speak of the impending loss, the certainty of absence, when to do so would only make it more tangible, more real for both of us? I reached out, embracing him tightly, before settling back into my chair, drawing it closer to his. Together, we watched the rain fall, the world bathed in the dusky hues of the June twilight.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father died. The treatments, the chemo and radiation, had only prolonged his suffering, extending his lifespan beyond the doctors' predictions. But what purpose did this prolonged agony serve? I couldn't comprehend. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered into the silent night, my voice choked with grief. No prayers formed on my lips. If a God existed, I believed he had long since ceased to listen.\n\nThe thought of witnessing his final breaths, his life fading into the unknown, filled me with dread. I couldn't bear to watch the source of my existence slip away. I wanted to remember him as he had lived, not as he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his own family. I was certain he wouldn't want me to be a mere observer at his deathbed.  I retreated to the sanctuary of my bed, curling into a tight ball, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nBut it never came. No one called.",
            "The concept of the \"Gothic Novel\" presents a fascinating paradox, as Ian Watt aptly points out in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" This literary mode has encountered a spectrum of critical responses, facing both dismissal and acclaim, accused of lacking depth while simultaneously lauded for its evocative \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).\n\nHorace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" widely considered the inaugural work of the Gothic genre, skillfully blends elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romance traditions. This fusion gives rise to a novel form of literary expression, as Walpole, in his preface, designates it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval theatrical conventions, architectural styles, and cultural practices. Notably, the term \"Gothic\" itself carried multifaceted connotations at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, often associated with archaism or perceived cultural inferiority in the face of what was deemed \"modern\" progress. However, the convergence of these \"Gothic\" theatrical elements with the nascent novel format, allowing for a more intimate exploration of characters' inner lives, contributes to the enduring appeal of the Gothic, enabling it to simultaneously feel both antiquated and refreshingly new to readers separated by time from its origins.\n\nA prominent thematic thread woven throughout Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of knighthood, encompassing rigorous training and the cultivation of virtues, is both preserved and reinterpreted in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers due to its symbolic representation of the archetype of the courageous, honorable, and competent knight, a figure which, according to these writers (particularly Walpole), had seemingly faded from contemporary society. By incorporating chivalric principles and conduct, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the genre's eventual evolution into Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a vehicle to critique and potentially ameliorate the perceived moral shortcomings of the present.\n\nWalpole, writing \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a period of political turmoil and personal distress, may have been grappling with anxieties about the future. Facing political challenges and accusations, he possibly reflected on the perceived decline of morality and innate goodness that characterized the \"Gothic era,\" contrasting it with the complexities of his own time. This notion is evident in the character of Frederic. Before his introduction, the reader is presented with descriptions that strongly suggest chivalric qualities:\n\n[Insert the original description of Frederic here]\n\nThe portrayal of Frederic evokes a heightened sense of traditional chivalry, employing exaggerated imagery to introduce the burgeoning Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the intricate network of processes involved in delivering goods from the initial customer order to the final product in the hands of the consumer. This concept, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, focuses on optimizing the entire chain of operations, from raw materials sourcing to production, distribution, and ultimately, customer satisfaction.  \n\nOliver highlighted the importance of a strategic approach, emphasizing the need to plan, implement, and monitor every stage of the supply chain to ensure efficient and timely fulfillment of customer needs.  \n\nSix key elements underpin the effectiveness of a robust supply chain: production, sourcing, inventory management, location strategy, transportation logistics, and information flow.  Businesses leverage these elements to provide exceptional customer service and maintain a competitive edge.\n\nProduction, the initial stage, lays the groundwork for the entire chain. It involves meticulously defining the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of production processes.  Understanding customer demand is paramount, and market analysis serves as a crucial guide in determining product specifications and production volumes. \n\nOnce market insights are gathered, managers must decide on the optimal production locations, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer demand.  Careful scheduling of workloads and equipment maintenance are essential to ensure smooth and efficient production. \n\nThe importance of meticulous planning cannot be overstated, as any oversight can result in significant time and financial losses.  For instance, my experience at retail giants like Walmart and Target revealed the critical role of standardized procedures. \n\nFrom employee uniforms to shipment receiving protocols, every aspect of the business has a well-defined process, minimizing confusion and ensuring seamless operations.",
            "A cardboard sign held aloft by actress Ellen Page, best known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" presents a perplexing message: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"  The sign, scrawled with a Sharpie, portrays a disconcerting juxtaposition against the backdrop of a bustling street corner.  \n\nBurma, more formally known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation currently under the control of a military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, a series of public demonstrations, the first in a decade, erupted across the country.  These protests, largely spearheaded by Buddhist monks, were dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" due to the saffron-colored robes worn by the monks.  \n\nInitially, the Burmese government showed a degree of tolerance, permitting peaceful gatherings. However, the situation quickly escalated, transforming into a violent clash with the junta.  Military forces engaged in raids on monasteries, further fueling the unrest.  Foreign journalists who dared to cover the protests faced immediate detention.  Tragically, Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, was killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for documenting the unfolding events.  While official figures cite a death toll of 13, Colonel Hla Win, who had defected from the army, provided a starkly different account, alleging thousands of fatalities that remained unreported. \n\nSadly, this pattern of oppression is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have consistently sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Ancient Roman emperors, for instance, proclaimed themselves divinely ordained rulers, wielding absolute authority over their subjects.  In Japan, emperors were revered as deities, believed to guide their people to prosperity through innovation and tradition.  Even in contemporary times, instances of governmental overreach and suppression of freedom persist.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 serve as a chilling reminder of the brutal consequences of dissent.  Students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered in Tiananmen Square to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Chinese government.  The true death toll from the ensuing crackdown remains shrouded in secrecy, with official figures drastically lower than estimates from independent sources.  Similarly, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s witnessed the systematic extermination of Tutsis and political moderates by Hutu militia groups backed by the Rwandan government.  And, of course, the horrors of Hitler's Third Reich, where Jewish people were systematically persecuted and murdered, stand as a stark testament to the depths of human cruelty when unchecked by compassion and justice.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz genre is largely due to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his talent for molding his orchestra. While his presence on the piano often remains understated within the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his ability to craft intricate and richly layered pieces that showcased the individual strengths of each band member. He expertly designed a framework that allowed for spontaneous improvisational flourishes from soloists, while simultaneously composing tightly structured passages and melodic motifs that drew upon the distinctive styles of his musicians to illuminate musical ideas. This meticulous approach extended to the orchestra's overall tone, shaping a cohesive and unique sonic identity for every piece. Through his mastery of each player's individual sound and their collective synergy as an ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most innovative and groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its exploration of Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative spirit, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his innovative use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early composition exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also demonstrates his ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his work. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and the reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions to a more raspy, expressive tone towards its conclusion.\n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that embellishes the primary melody, highlighting several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase.\n\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call-and-response pattern between the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: This chorus marks the climax of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by a rhythmic \"stop-time\" effect from the brass and rhythm sections.\n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. This time, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique,  performing as an instrumental solo voice.\n\nTag: A brief concluding tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, unexpected ending provided by a trombone.\n\n\n\nEllington's utilization of voice to add a dimension of tonal color to this piece serves as a single example of a stylistic trait that pervades his entire body of work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his skill in tight orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing seamlessly integrates the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental facets of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sonic tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands on these concepts, as Ellington utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a cornerstone of Ellington's orchestra, to great effect by introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From the time she was fourteen, a persistent feeling of incompleteness had clung to her. This yearning, this void, refused to be ignored, a constant presence in her teenage years. By seventeen, she realized it wasn't a desire for material things, but for a connection with someone. However, she found herself uninterested in the romantic advances of the boys who were drawn to her. They made their awkward attempts, but none of them captured her attention. She often pondered this unusual circumstance, searching for an explanation for this disconnect. Years of introspection yielded theories, but none felt satisfying enough to hold onto. So she lived, navigating life while constantly questioning her own desires.\n\nHer home life was typically tranquil. Her parents were kind, composed individuals, rarely disagreeing with each other. Arguments with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their only clashes arose when she asserted her independence and vibrant personality. Though the offspring of a calm couple, she possessed a lively and engaging spirit that made her both appealing and likeable.\n\nHowever, today was far from peaceful. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, a sharp cry pierced the air from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice, laced with distress. Rushing into the room, panic rising within her, she cried out, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" She found her mother on the floor, clutching her side, her breathing shallow and pained.  \"Ow...sweetheart...need...hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words fragmented and strained. The urgency in her mother's voice was undeniable. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to get you.\"  Her mother pointed weakly, and the daughter, grateful for the strength training she had undertaken, lifted her mother and carried her to the car. She gently placed her mother in the back seat, lying down, and drove swiftly towards the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a symphony of sterile scents, a mixture of disinfectant and sickness, tinged with fear. But her own fear was overshadowed by her concern for her mother. She rushed her mother inside, calling for medical help. A group of worried faces gathered around, quickly maneuvering a gurney and laying her mother upon it. They whisked her away, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a stepladder while reaching for a vase on the top shelf.",
            "The purpose of this research was to investigate the connection between adhering to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as measured by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, such as fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and plant proteins (excluding potatoes). It also emphasizes monounsaturated fats over saturated fats and incorporates fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted within this dietary approach.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a correlation between adhering to the Med diet and a reduced risk of both total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial also demonstrated the Med diet's effectiveness in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals who are obese, compared to a low-fat diet. However, these earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis observational study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses from 11 US states. Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each woman six times, based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) which assessed their dietary intake during the preceding year.  Over 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this period. The reliability of the FFQs was established through validation studies.\n\nReports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through a review of medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where these records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the study, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category.  For each FFQ, researchers calculated factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary intake, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. These averages combined scores from the previous two years. Adjustments were made for potential \"confounding\" factors (variables that could influence the results) by taking into account age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nThe findings revealed that a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a greater aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The American economy experienced a significant downturn in 2007, marked by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and the failure of numerous major corporations.  This economic instability persists to this day, prompting a critical examination of its origins and potential solutions.  A key contributing factor was a confluence of political decisions and financial practices that encouraged risky lending practices.  Banks and financial institutions were pressured to extend subprime loans, mortgages offered to borrowers with lower creditworthiness, into a financial system that was already inadequately equipped to handle such risks.  Simultaneously, government-sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were incentivized to securitize these mortgages, bundling them into complex investment products known as CDOs and CDSs.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.  With an eye toward re-election, the administration sought to boost its popularity by relaxing lending standards, a move that ultimately set the stage for the subprime mortgage crisis several years later.  News reports from that era, such as an article in the New York Times by Steven Holmes, warned of potential consequences, foreshadowing the government's future involvement in bailing out the financial sector.\n\nThe crisis was further exacerbated by the emergence of innovative, yet complex, mortgage products. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) became increasingly prevalent, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market.  This interconnectedness led to excessive leverage, particularly among U.S. households and financial institutions, leaving them vulnerable to any downturn in the housing market.\n\nWhen the housing bubble inevitably burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered substantial losses.  Leading investment banks reported staggering amounts of mortgage debt in 2007, representing a significant portion of the U.S. GDP.  The crisis forced several major institutions, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, to collapse, while others, such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, were compelled to convert to commercial banks subject to stricter regulations.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with massive mortgage debt, were placed under government control in 2008.",
            "Exposition, a corner stone of storytelling, can be a writer's playground or a reader's purgatory. \n\nWhile the adage \"Show, don't tell\" is well-known, even seasoned authors like myself can fall prey to long, expository passages that bog down the narrative.  Imagine, if you will, a scene where a character delivers a torrent of information, akin to a verbal information dump, reminiscent of Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In essence, exposition is the tendency to narratively relay what happens, often in a straightforward manner.\n\nConsider this: a story might state that the protagonist met her soulmate in a specific location and time, followed by a grand wedding and a tragic murder witnessed by the heroine.\n\nNow, imagine this entire sequence unfolding across two pages, with minimal dialogue from both the husband and wife.  This approach would likely leave readers feeling disconnected and unengaged.  \n\nInstead, a more effective approach would delve into the husband's character, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions. We'd witness the heroine's transformation, demonstrating how his presence enriched her life, supporting the later claim that he was profoundly important to her.  \n\nA nuanced introduction to the husband would allow readers to empathize with his fate, and gain insight into the heroine's character: her attraction to him, the depth of their bond, her values and aspirations reflected through his eyes. Ultimately, the reader would grieve alongside the heroine, forging a stronger connection to her.\n\nIn essence, instead of simply outlining the bare bones of the plot (\"They met, they married, he died\"), a writer should provide depth and richness to the narrative.\n\n\nThis often means resisting the urge to rush past details, such as a new character's past experiences, aspirations, or everyday habits.   For instance, a character with an Air Force background, now a gas station night manager, married twice, childless, fishing enthusiast, harboring a secret dream of owning the station, and enjoying Eggs Benedict for breakfast, offers a wealth of material for exploration.",
            "My media consumption this morning centered around two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live report from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011, featured a story about a stabbing in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the perpetrator, Shad Hostettler, was identified and his mugshot displayed. The report, which lasted approximately two minutes, described the incident as a multiple stabbing and mentioned his subsequent arrest. I felt the coverage was appropriately concise given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second report delved into an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers sustained critical injuries, and at the time of the broadcast, no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was actively investigating the case. This story seemed relatively brief, and I speculated that this might be attributed to the victim's race or the neighborhood's demographics. This observation aligns with a pattern I've noticed over time: media attention often varies when it comes to crime victims based on their racial or ethnic background. For instance, high-profile cases involving white individuals tend to receive more extensive coverage compared to similar incidents involving minorities.\n\nSubsequent segments covered a gunshot hole discovered on a Med-Flight helicopter, a predicted weekend of rain and thunderstorms, and a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. The helicopter incident involved a .22 caliber bullet fired from a rifle, prompting Crime-Stoppers to offer a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension. The weather report was brief, likely intended as a teaser to encourage viewers to stay tuned. The robbery report described the suspect as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, standing approximately six feet tall and weighing around 150 pounds. I found the emphasis on his race and skin tone to be somewhat noteworthy.\n\nThe final segment focused on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana to Ohio from Texas. Interestingly, instead of explicitly stating the sentence length as 25 years, the broadcast opted for the numerical \"300 months.\" The reason for this stylistic choice was unclear, but perhaps it was intended to convey a harsher tone. Rodriguez's ethnicity was also mentioned, which I felt might not have been essential to the story's core.",
            "The relationship between brothers is marked by a profound and enduring connection. Within this bond reside a complex tapestry of emotions: affection, admiration, envy, and even malice, to name but a few. Brothers possess a unique understanding of each other, surpassing that of any other relationship. They see themselves reflected in their brothers' eyes, not as others perceive them, but as their true selves.  It is in times of extreme hardship that the true nature of this bond comes to the forefront, revealing its  potential for both great good and profound darkness. These emotions, when unleashed, carry a heavy weight, demanding to be acknowledged and addressed. Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal tie involves confronting the consequences they inevitably bring. \n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this intricate theme, delving into the turbulent emotions that accompany it. Set against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered scenery, two young brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile. The narrative culminates in a scene where bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive.  The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother.  The narrator's perspective further illuminates the protagonist's complex feelings and his perception of the world around him, both of which exert a powerful influence on his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions are driven primarily by a consuming emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful expedition, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle.  He yearns for a brother who can keep pace with his adventurous spirit, someone he can share his skills with, such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He desires a companion for his explorations, someone to race to Horsehead Landing and share moments of quiet companionship in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's physical limitations, stemming from a weak heart, make these aspirations impossible. The protagonist's dreams are shattered by the realization that his brother's frailty will forever prevent him from fully participating in the activities that define his own existence. This realization sparks anger within him, even leading him to contemplate the unthinkable – suffocating Doodle with a pillow. The mere thought reveals the depth of his frustration and the extent to which he feels burdened by his brother's dependence.  \n\nYet, Doodle's innocent smile offers a glimmer of hope, momentarily melting the protagonist's resentment. This simple act of affection suggests that his murderous intentions may not have been deeply rooted. Deep down, a primal bond of love for his brother persists.",
            "The human mind is a intricate system designed for handling information in a creative manner. As technological advancements progressed from rudimentary to sophisticated, the analogies used to describe the brain's functionality also evolved. Initially, comparisons were drawn to a wax tablet, then to a piece of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphorical representations, while helpful, have inherent limitations and can potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.\n\nThe initial stage of information processing involves sensory input, where organs like the eyes, ears, and skin transform external stimuli, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo a series of transformations within the brain, guided by complex algorithms that function in both a bottom-up and top-down manner. To illustrate, when viewing a picture of a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing analyzes basic elements like color, shape, and boundaries to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages prior knowledge and expectations to accelerate this recognition process. In this case, it might prompt the brain to interpret the shape as a box rather than a void within the white backdrop.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attentional filter determines its significance and directs it towards appropriate cognitive processes. For example, while the brain processes every blade of grass when looking at your shoes, a healthy attentional filter prevents you from consciously registering each individual blade. Conversely, your name stands out even in a noisy environment due to the filter's prioritization. This filtering mechanism operates across multiple stages of processing, continuously modulating the flow of information.\n\nFor the brain to effectively process information, it must first store it.  Memory systems encompass various categories, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. The initial step involves encoding, which involves transforming information into a format suitable for storage. The specific encoding type depends on the nature of the stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally (based on visual appearance), phonemically (based on sound), or semantically (based on meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on electrical signals circulating through a specific neuronal network for a short duration. Long-term memory is believed to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. These models draw upon insights from various fields, including human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" offers a chilling glimpse into a future where technological advancement and a pervasive capitalist system converge to create a dystopian society. The novel explores the dangers of prioritizing collective happiness over individual freedom, highlighting the manipulation and control exerted by a powerful governing authority. Through the lens of Marxist theory, one can discern Huxley's anxieties regarding the trajectory of these societal forces. Terms like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" often used in Marxist analysis, resonate throughout the narrative, suggesting that Huxley saw the emerging economic structures of his time as inherently flawed.\n\nHuxley employs the Marxist concept of \"false consciousness\" to critique capitalism. He portrays the working class, or \"proletariat,\" as being kept ignorant of their true economic position due to their preoccupation with immediate gratification.  This state of ignorance, Huxley argues, is a result of ideological manipulation, a point strikingly evident in the conditioning of the citizens of \"Brave New World.\" The lower social castes, designated as Delta, Gamma, and so on, lack genuine autonomy.  They are systematically conditioned through \"hypnopædia,\" a form of sleep learning, to crave consumption and material excess, ultimately serving the interests of the World Controller, the figurehead of this oppressive regime.\n\nThe novel illustrates the concept of \"hegemony,\" the dominance of a particular group over others, in a stark manner. The lower classes are kept oblivious to the machinations of those in power, essentially \"buying into\" an ideology that perpetuates the existing social and economic structures. Meanwhile, the upper classes, while aware of the system's inherent inequalities, remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions without challenge.\n\nThe absence of meaningful relationships in \"Brave New World\" further underscores Huxley's critique. Characters seem interchangeable, lacking depth and complexity. This superficiality, perhaps, reflects Huxley's belief that technological advancement and unchecked capitalism erode human connection and individuality. Love and genuine emotion are absent, replaced by superficial interactions driven by physical attraction and fleeting pleasure.\n\nThe citizens' unquestioning acceptance of their societal roles and the rigid hierarchy within \"Brave New World\" mirror Marxist theories about the proletariat's acceptance of their subjugation. They are reassured of their superiority as long as they remain compliant consumers, perpetuating the cycle of exploitation.",
            "My time as a student at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, or the equivalent of four and a half semesters.  Campus navigation poses a notable challenge for many, myself included. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at, arguably, the easternmost point of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.  Journeying from my East Halls home to classes located in more central areas, such as the Willard Building, could easily consume up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when contending with inclement weather, which is a frequent occurrence in State College.  Conversations with an alumnus, not much older than myself, revealed that a relatively recent past saw the East Halls dormitories separated from the main campus by vast tracts of undeveloped land. Today, this formerly vacant expanse has been transformed into a vibrant landscape of sports fields, expansive new structures including the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of residential apartments.  As our campus continues to expand, the task of traversing its sprawling grounds becomes increasingly complex.  What constitutes the most effective solution to this mobility dilemma?  In the context of a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer. However, the bicycle alone cannot provide a comprehensive solution; students must actively utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to cater to the needs of cyclists.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had recently returned to cycling after a multi-year hiatus prompted an intriguing observation.  He expressed surprise at his own lapse in cycling, stating, \"Bicycles are fantastic; for a period, it wasn't considered fashionable to ride one, but it's undoubtedly the most practical mode of transportation.\" Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling boasts remarkable efficiency as a means of travel. A modest meal of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel you a distance of 30 miles or more.  Similar to many undergraduates, I currently reside off campus, located a distance from the campus center comparable to that of some dormitories.  The most prudent decision I have made this year was acquiring a bicycle.  Daily, I attend classes in the Thomas Building, a location that entails a 25-minute walk from my residence.  Cycling can significantly reduce this travel time to a mere 5 minutes if I maintain a brisk pace. The primary obstacle lies in Pollock Road, which offers the most direct route to the Thomas Building from my home, but its condition can pose challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists alike.  While walking possesses its merits, my current schedule leaves little room for it.  Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole dependable option for reaching my classes.  Walking to Thomas daily would necessitate an additional 30-40 minutes per day, accumulating to over two and a half hours per week.  Factor in the time required for traversing to and from other classes, appointments, and various other commitments, and the total time commitment becomes unmanageable."
