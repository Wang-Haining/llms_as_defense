            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In negotiations, culture is a key factor that must be understood. It is not a single, uniform entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it is. Simplistic statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" fail to capture this complexity. While cultural generalizations can be useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the specific relevance of culture to the negotiations and how cultural attitudes can influence the discussions. Encountering a foreign culture often leads to comparisons with one's own, which is a natural part of the process.\n\nGaining insight into a foreign culture or mindset might involve learning about its history or understanding its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, it is crucial to accept it and navigate within its parameters, especially during negotiations, and particularly when one has less bargaining power. When negotiating in a foreign environment, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also vital to understand that culture goes beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within the same country often have distinct corporate cultures. For example, some emphasize long work hours, while others prefer a more laid-back approach. Corporate culture can manifest in dress codes, communication styles (such as direct versus indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to specific charities. The diversity within American corporate culture, which varies from company to company and even from region to region, highlights the variety of thought within a single societal culture. Other cultures may seem more uniform, but this uniformity often invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is critical, as they explain why a culture behaves in certain ways. In cultures that value saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining might not rush to settle quickly. Considering these cultural tendencies is essential before negotiations begin. However, it is also advantageous for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening for St. Anselm's discourse on the existence of God. This perspective is shared by another thinker, Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments we will also explore. Since both philosophers support the same notion, our task is to decide which argument stands out as more compelling. To streamline our discussion, we'll assume they both agree on the existence of the God portrayed in the Bible. Broadening their concept of God beyond this specific depiction would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as both are based on defending this singular idea of God. It is important to note that while both philosophers present noteworthy points, neither offers a completely comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this assertion, let's delve into St. Anselm's central argument. Anselm proposes a pathway to understanding rooted in faith, suggesting that one can find evidence of God by introspection. He argues that since God exists within our comprehension, imagining His nonexistence is impossible. Although the language he uses can be complex and occasionally unclear, the main idea is that the evidence for God exists within our own minds. St. Anselm implies that we don't need to look beyond our own consciousness to discover the truth about God, as the existence of this deity is evident by reflecting on what we innately know to be true. External evidence is apparently unnecessary. This principle of accepting beliefs without incontrovertible empirical evidence is commonly referred to as faith within Christian literature.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a different approach. He claims that God's existence can be established solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This concept could be advantageous in evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by enabling the conversion of new believers through logic rather than relying on their acceptance of unproven beliefs. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments to support the existence of God: motion, causality, contingency, degrees of perfection, and order. In each case, he essentially illustrates that God's existence is a logical necessity. For instance, if you are aware that one piece of a puzzle is missing and you complete the rest of it, logic allows you to infer the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without physically seeing it.",
            "Writers often employ a variety of methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their audience regarding key themes. Some of these strategies prove to be more impactful than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs an array of such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald juxtaposes an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. At other times, he assigns symbolic significance to an object or concept and uses it to serve this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently utilizes this latter approach with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald constructs symbolic meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later leverages to remind readers of particular emotions associated with significant elements.\n\nThe symbolism Fitzgerald develops for white/gray revolves around the notion of uniformity; white is associated with elegance and a higher social class, while gray suggests something older and faded. He establishes this symbolic meaning early in the novel through repeated references. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted \"in white\" (p. 8)—in fact, white clothing is prevalent: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (p. 41) to Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (p. 36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (p. 30). The only notable absence of white is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (p. 40). Fitzgerald further clarifies the significance of these colors by applying them to ordinary, seemingly trivial subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (p. 56), the names on the guest list at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (p. 61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine’s apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—depicting uniformity (p. 28). He describes everyday people and places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy's past is described as a \"white girlhood\" (p. 19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (p. 23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" near the railroad is \"gray\" (p. 26), and a dog-seller is portrayed as \"a gray old man\" (p. 27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough symbolic weight, he uses them to convey themes of insignificance or conformity regarding specific subjects. This technique becomes apparent with Daisy. After a period with little emphasis on these colors, Fitzgerald presents Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view her as less of an individual character and more of a standardized aspiration for Gatsby (p. 74). Fitzgerald continues to use this method to portray Daisy as a uniform element, such as referencing the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (p. 18) and her wearing a \"white\" (p. 115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

There is a thriving demand for organic produce through community-supported agriculture in San Diego, leading to many local groups having extensive waiting lists. Organic dairy products such as eggs and milk are equally sought after. Numerous organic farms in the region offer tours of their facilities and provide opportunities for activities like hiking and birdwatching. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government initiatives while enhancing habitats, thus supporting recreational use and offering farm tours and educational programs as a source of income.\n\nIn addition to potentially tapping into a profitable niche market, organic farming is recognized for fostering greater biodiversity among plants and animals, attributed to the absence of chemical use in soils and water. Nonetheless, organic agriculture can entail higher expenses compared to conventional farming, as it demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses. Small-scale organic farms also lack the economies of scale found in larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife but not directly related to organic farming can also lead to increased labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats like edge areas or open patches. Therefore, there are multiple reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land for this scenario is a parcel near the town of Potrero, located in the unincorporated area of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This location is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently in review, which considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Several species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, certain butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others like burrowing owls are in decline and may soon be classified as endangered.\n\nHistorically, this area was home to Native Americans for countless generations before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 19th century. The land was included in an original homestead patent, suggesting its use for grazing or wood production over the years. To better understand what a small farmer might achieve on this land, I selected a property from a real estate website and explored available government programs to assess the options for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly practices. I also identified an organic farm nearby as a model of potential agricultural endeavors in this locale.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound and unyielding, encompassing a wide range of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other in ways unmatched by other relationships, seeing themselves in each other's eyes. It is during the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse, and these emotions come with significant consequences. Understanding these feelings involves confronting the outcomes they produce. When one gazes into a brother's eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves in their truest form, not as others see them. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship of two brothers, capturing the intense emotions tied to their bond. Amidst a richly depicted setting, the brothers embark on a journey that is doomed from the start. The story culminates in a scene where overwhelming disappointment collides with immense pride, with only one brother surviving. This theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reflect the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is largely driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From the first time he ventures out with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic outing, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a sibling to whom he could impart his skills, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He imagined a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or perch with him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, these aspirations are unattainable due to Doodle's frail heart, which made his survival uncertain and vigorous activities nearly impossible. This realization crushed the young protagonist's dreams filled with vivid fantasies. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle and briefly considers smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such a drastic act? Yet, his resolve softens when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that fills the protagonist with hope. This moment suggests that his previous intention was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he instinctively loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has developed from its early stages to the present day, the analogies used to understand the brain have also evolved. At first, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and most recently, a computer. While exploring the brain's functions, remember that these comparisons have their limitations and can sometimes lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins when sensory organs receive input and convert physical stimuli—like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons—into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory data through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when observing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the object's borders—where a sharp color change occurs—to conclude you're looking at a box. Top-down processing then uses these conclusions to help you quickly recognize the box. In this scenario, top-down processing may assist in identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its significance and determines the cognitive processes to which it should be directed. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. However, you might still hear your name in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention modulating the results repeatedly.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on the structure of the printed word, its sound, or its meaning. After being stored, information needs to be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a particular sequence of neurons briefly. It is hypothesized that long-term memory is maintained by the structure of specific protein types.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are based on how humans retrieve memories, others draw from computer science, and still others rely on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that nodes represent concepts, with links between them based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which might link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of major corporations. This recession lingers today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis was a result of imprudent and shortsighted political decisions that pushed banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans within a fragile financial system. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to underwrite and repurpose these loans into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, exacerbating the situation and affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to increase his popularity for re-election. To do so, the administration eased lending practices, inadvertently setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times noted in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the largest underwriter of home mortgages, faced growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend loans to low and moderate income individuals, while also dealing with shareholder expectations for continued profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"The government-backed corporation might encounter difficulties during an economic downturn, triggering a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending practices would inevitably lead to economic turmoil.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex mortgage structures that emerged. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used before the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This overexposure made U.S. households and financial markets susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities suffered greatly. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, amounting to about 30% of the country's GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transition into commercial banks with stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—a moment in storytelling where a writer might feel the urge to showcase their talent with captivating, even enchanting language. It can also be the section where readers might lose interest or feel the need to retreat, grumbling about the narrative. Dr. Merlin has been known to express frustration when faced with an overwhelming amount of detail, and not in a way that's enjoyable.\n\nExposition is not an ally to your storytelling.\n\nMany seasoned readers are familiar with the advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin occasionally finds herself mired in extensive sections where either nothing transpires or too much is conveyed. Exposition is like a mischievous imp whispering to the writer to get past the background information to reach the engaging parts (distinct from the imp on the other shoulder, which tempts the writer to divulge every aspect of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, generally through straightforward language. In films, this occurs when one character provides another with a significant amount of information, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nConsider an example: in a story, you learn that the heroine encountered her beloved at a specific place and time, they wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to unfold over two pages, with both characters receiving only a couple of dialogue lines each. You'd expect the author to dedicate time to developing the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions the depth of his love for his wife. Likewise, you'd expect the heroine to illustrate, in various ways, how his presence profoundly affected and enriched her life (especially if the narrative later explicitly states this). A well-rounded introduction to the husband's character would foster an emotional connection to his fate and offer insights into the heroine's character: what she cherished in him, the strength of their bond, hints of her thoughts, beliefs, and aspirations as seen through his eyes, and more. You would share in her grief over his death, deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance beyond the bare outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to provide that depth. (Glancing at the metaphor, sighs, and continues) It can be tempting to hurry through certain aspects. You might be introducing a new character, aware that he previously served in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, has been married twice with no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first broadcast was NBC 4, aired live on the morning of August 13, 2011. The leading story covered an incident involving a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. The coverage included his mug shot, portraying him in a negative light, and lasted for about two minutes as the situation was still unfolding. The report only mentioned that he had stabbed her multiple times and was subsequently arrested. The time allocated to this segment seemed fitting to me.\n\nThe second report involved an early morning shooting victim, Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests or suspects were reported, but a SWAT Team was investigating the crime. The coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might be related to the fact that the victim was a Black man or that the incident took place in a predominantly Black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white individuals.\n\nAnother story discussed a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, with details about the suspected location of the incident. It was determined that a .22 caliber rifle bullet had struck the helicopter, and Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter’s arrest.\n\nThe broadcast also included a weather update, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely intended as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAdditionally, there was a report about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on the suspect's race and skin color.\n\nThe final story involved Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who was sentenced for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, the report noted his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, which may have been an attempt to make the punishment seem harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, a detail I felt was unnecessary for the story.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund. However, it offers more flexibility as it can be traded on an exchange just like a stock. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share in a transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the typical mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs involves paying a commission, similar to stock transactions. One of the appealing aspects of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite the clearly outlined advantages, it's wise for astute financial investors to scrutinize whether these benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to assess if owning a single ETF is as beneficial as owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and if there might be better configurations of the same stocks for an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo analyze the ETF, including every holding would be cumbersome, so we've chosen to focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how accurately these ten stocks reflect the overall ETF IHF, we can normalize the current asset percentages to 100% and calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio solely comprises these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio solely containing the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, marking a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of these top ten holdings is .12 lower compared to the ETF as a whole. Preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio consisting only of these top 10 holdings might achieve a higher return with a lower beta. Nonetheless, there remains the possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically distinct from one another. To determine if these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100%, allowing us to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a noticeable decline in the submission of commuter logs during the third month of the project. This was somewhat disappointing, and it's unclear what exactly caused it. As winter set in on our New England campus, fewer people were likely commuting by bike or walking, which could partially explain the reduction. December is also the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with completing assignments and grading. It's possible that filling out the commuter logs simply became less of a priority. Furthermore, December is the start of the hectic holiday season, leading into a month-long break when many students and faculty are not required to be on campus. Classes pick back up in late January for the spring semester, which might also contribute to the lower number of logs submitted that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. Perhaps it's typical for a project like this to start with enthusiasm that gradually wanes. To address this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a campaign aimed at revitalizing interest, which successfully boosted log submissions that month. Thus, one of the obstacles we encountered was sustaining project momentum amidst both a natural dip in engagement and the specific challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks common in academic settings. Another challenge inherent in this project (or any initiative promoting alternative commuting) is that people value the autonomy and convenience of driving their own vehicles, a deeply ingrained cultural preference. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, including gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage services, an independent bookstore, and some national retail chains. It would have been intriguing to see how offering more substantial prizes, like a high-quality bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation—potentially alleviating the engagement drop we experienced. The prizes remained relatively constant throughout the project. If their value had escalated over time, it might have spurred increased participation. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing more significant prizes like a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially boosted engagement instead of seeing it decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I was particularly intrigued by the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly employ editing techniques to create visual illusions. My analysis mainly centered on detailing the stylistic features of most trick films and identifying the unique elements in some of the later ones. Typically, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to set environments, framed within a frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, and utilize long and medium shots, strictly adhering to the one shot equals one film principle. Nonetheless, some films from the early 1900s defy these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by trick films is their use of interior sets framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not following the subjects or objects. This setup, prevalent in early cinema, draws inspiration from theatre and, for trick films, from vaudeville and magic shows. A limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films usually move laterally and seldom approach or retreat from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays put.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots, with occasional medium shots. Close-ups are absent in any trick films from the Edison library. This approach mirrors theatre and vaudeville traditions, where audiences view the entire performance within the stage's confines. As in most early films, actors remain in the middle ground, precluding close-ups.\n\nGenerally, early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equating to a film, limiting their duration to about a minute or less, based on frames per second. This restricts the trick films' narrative or dramatic potential; they often focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot perceived by the viewer doesn't necessarily correspond to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might comprise several spliced together to create an illusion of appearance or disappearance. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a detailed examination reveals the transition point where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the viewer perceiving the entire film as one continuous shot.",
            "In The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its paradoxical nature. The Gothic style has faced a range of opinions—it's been criticized, celebrated, accused of lacking substance, and applauded for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as Burke notes. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blended elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances, establishing what would become the proto-Gothic genre and introducing a novel way of storytelling. Walpole integrated \"old\" theatrical aspects with 'new' realism found in 'modern' novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This genre often harks back to medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was released, \"gothic\" described a range of people, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary progressions. The Gothic's blend of theatrical elements and the novel's new ability to delve into characters' psyches is what has allowed Gothic literature to endure, appearing both outdated and fresh to readers far removed from its original context.\n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, or the training of an ideal knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. For Gothic writers, chivalry symbolized the noble, honorable, and skilled knight—qualities they felt were lacking in society, especially Walpole. By romanticizing the \"gothic past\" through chivalric ideals, a bridge to Romanticism is suggested, with an aim to better the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned about the future. Involved in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he may have believed that the moral integrity seen in the Gothic era was missing from contemporary society. This idea is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before encountering Frederic, readers learn he represents many chivalric qualities. He is portrayed as:\n\nFrederic is painted with numerous classic chivalric images; first and foremost, he is a prince who has endured hardships, been profoundly affected by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" character is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of activities involved in moving goods from the initial customer order through stages such as raw materials, supply, production, and finally to product distribution. The concept of supply chain management was coined by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He articulated the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and regulating the supply chain to effectively meet customer demands. This process hinges on six critical elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers employ these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nThe supply chain process begins with production, serving as its cornerstone. This phase determines the timing, rationale, location, and methodology for production. Managers must be attuned to customer preferences, which can be discerned by analyzing market trends—an invaluable indicator of consumer demand. Upon understanding market demands, managers decide which products to manufacture and in what quantities. It's then essential to choose an appropriate production facility that balances volume and quality, aligning with customer satisfaction goals. Once the production site is established, management shifts focus to scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. The meticulous planning of each detail in production is crucial to avoid significant time and financial losses. For instance, in my experience at Wal-Mart and Target, both retailers had systematic guidelines for every operational aspect, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes help maintain clarity and efficiency.\n\nThe next integral component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and develop outsourcing partnerships. A company might operate several production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, staff, and expertise. Managers must determine which division is best suited for specific product processes. Additionally, they might consider outsourcing to other companies to enhance velocity, which is the capacity to deliver quality and adaptability while minimizing or maintaining costs.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the period's aristocracy. However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are often regarded as Victorian yet deviate from this norm. These works incorporate elements of mystery and an unusual flair that are not typical of the era's novels. This approach enhances the depth of the characters, offering insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing thoughts flooded his mind. It seemed as if he were still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument: for the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he focused his attention, ... he realized he was speaking to them.... Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and all was chaos and commotion, as some invisible force hurriedly whisked him away. Through all these rapid visions, there persisted a vague, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him endlessly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the details and purposes differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these peculiar events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner struggles, his sources of pain, and his understanding of the true nature of the circumstances around him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while he seeks help. The passage highlights the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the severe state of his health, which is vividly depicted through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing his senses to the point where he is unaware of the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, as the pain is now an enduring presence linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises regarding whose intentions led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting underscores the idea that Oliver has little control over anything, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at risk. This passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as though old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of preserving his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it disappeared as soon as it arrived – and night descended once more; a night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I took on a role in an after-school program, where I tutored young students at the elementary level. My goal was to assist them in subjects where they faced challenges, though I was particularly strong in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a boy named Adrian, who I recall was in the third or fourth grade, because he was having significant reading difficulties. It soon became apparent that his issues were unusual; while he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, others were a complete miss. It was quite strange. Although Adrian was of Latino descent, he spoke perfect English, which initially puzzled me. Our progress was slow until I met his mother one day. While babysitting a handful of students who hadn't gone on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She couldn't speak English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills—I was still learning—we managed to communicate. At that moment, it struck me: Adrian's reading issues weren't due to a disability; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this realization made a significant difference for him, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's a reminder that these barriers aren't always as apparent as one might assume. Even for a child fluent in spoken English, reading can present a major hurdle. I believe we can all acknowledge this problem, but the question is, how do we address it? In Adrian's situation, the solution was straightforward: focused tutoring in English reading, especially on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who have limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is necessary to tackle this issue effectively.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is a valuable approach—not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual programs often surpass their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might be resource-intensive and not beneficial for the majority, this isn't true. If we implement these programs widely in classrooms, rather than treating them as exceptions, all students stand to gain. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Instead, it's feasible to have bilingual aides, tutors, or whatever title is suitable, to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, we're often introduced to the idea that something greater than ourselves exists, beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school to explore this concept, while others might go to Temple or search internally for answers. Many easily embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their parents. However, some of us outright reject these ideas, refusing to accept anything beyond our self-centered worlds. It's possible to adopt a belief system only to later shift to another. No matter the path, we strive to define ourselves through our personal views on spirituality. We seek guidance, hoping to move from darkness into light.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were on our porch, listening to rain drum on the tin roof while sharing cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain, flooding the plants around the porch. My father gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed both introspective and reminiscent. Over recent months, he had grown thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair thinning more than I recalled. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated and scared, unable to express how much I'd miss him, fearing that acknowledging it would make it more real. I hugged him, then sat closer, joining him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The treatments had not alleviated his pain but had extended his life a few months beyond doctors' predictions. I couldn't determine the value in prolonging his suffering. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I offered no prayers, convinced that if God existed, He had long stopped listening to me.\n\nI hadn't wanted to witness his transition from this life to another, so I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the end of the life that brought me into this world. I chose to remember my father by his life, not his death. I understood him more than others, even his family, and knew he wouldn't want me, his only child, to witness his passing. I isolated myself in my room for three days, awaiting the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an influential early advocate for Republicanism. Primarily an agriculturalist, his career in farming, coupled with a brief stint in politics, shaped his reputation for being vocal and committed to issues of personal liberty and governance. His belief in an agrarian society was central to his views on government. Taylor's efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to build an exemplary system, unencumbered by native traditions that might restrict the formation of self-governance. He was a fervent supporter of the natural rights of man, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one undermines them all, diminishing their collective value. Therefore, these rights should be beyond governmental reach. He argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and cunning, but that this should not be the case within a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor argued that government must recognize both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He was steadfast in his belief in a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He identified good principles as those safeguarding private property, enhancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. Taylor believed that a government founded on sound principles would function justly, despite being led by individuals driven by greed and self-interest. He saw self-interest as humanity's motivating force, deeming it harmful only when it led to the formation of sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others. A sound government was essential to curb man's natural flaws, requiring vigilant monitoring to prevent the introduction of detrimental principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He supported a highly limited Federal government, restricted to powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. Aware that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical, he also recognized the dangers of a simplistic, literal interpretation, which could become corrupt without considering the framers' intentions. Furthermore, Taylor viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind processing the scene in front of me without any particular emotion or connection. With a detached focus, I observed what lay before me, allowing thoughts to drift in and out of my consciousness almost as quickly as they appeared. It felt as though my mind was engaged in a fluid experience, absorbing the visuals without forming distinct, personal thoughts.\n\nInspired by an artist I once collaborated with, I invested in an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Ever since childhood, I had harbored a desire to draw, and this book offered insights ranging from the basics of using a pencil to the cognitive processes involved in interpreting lines. One of its techniques involved framing a picture with a square to simplify complex scenes, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen adjoining a dining room, into a more manageable image.\n\nIn that moment, as I looked down at the bowl before me, I found myself unable to apply that artistic frame mentally. Overwhelmed by the sight, I stood there in amazement. Just as Picasso explored his blue period and Monet had a penchant for greenery, I faced the origins of my own artistic journey, which I whimsically dubbed Work in Brown.\n\nWith my fingertips on the chosen tool, I felt muscles tense and relax as my hand moved purposefully, driven by creative intent. Water flowed smoothly, carrying away fragments to oblivion. My hand struck the toilet handle repeatedly, yet the stubborn brown package remained, clinging to the bottom like an unwelcome guest.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, standing with feet apart, and a green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I regarded the unpleasant bundle left behind in the Rite Aid restroom. After several more flushes and moments of quiet reflection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Straightening up, then bending over, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, reminiscent of a mother retrieving a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Young drivers face a significant risk on the roads, with multiple elements contributing to the high accident rates among teenagers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, a major issue is that the adolescent brain is not fully developed to deal with the complexities of driving. In addition to this, the lack of driving experience among teens leads to more fatal accidents, an increased likelihood of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road.  \n\nMoreover, teenagers are particularly vulnerable when they drive with friends—a common scenario. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. In response, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses, which limit the hours teens can drive and restrict them from carrying other minors as passengers. \n\nHowever, I view these provisional licenses as temporary fixes. The core problem lies in the fact that, statistically, the youngest drivers are not equipped to manage the responsibilities and dangers of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a standard driver’s license. According to USA Today, Zuckerman's research indicates that individuals under 19-20 years old often engage in risky behavior for excitement. It seems prudent to delay driving until this risk-taking behavior diminishes. If young teens continue to be licensed, we will see a rise in fatal accidents, with potentially alarming consequences in the coming years. By 2010, many children of the Baby Boomer generation will reach driving age, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.  \n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should drive. A provisional permit could still precede a full license, with a requisite number of driving hours, similar to current state requirements—such as California’s mandate of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given that teen driving statistics are concerning nationwide, a uniform national law could effectively safeguard teenagers across the country. The legislative solution I propose is not an unprecedented concept.",
            "This essay addresses three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the disorder is given. Then, the process of diagnosis is discussed, highlighting typical signs or \"red flags.\" The essay concludes by suggesting ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how well the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. It specifically refers to the perceptual handling of auditory data in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing, generating electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; the challenge lies in the brain’s ability to interpret sounds, such as distinguishing words or filtering conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing evaluations for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and created a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further encouraged research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various forms: affected individuals might struggle to pinpoint or hear sounds in space, have trouble distinguishing between multiple \"acoustic events,\" fail to recognize sound patterns, or find it difficult to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Sounds might be masked by subsequent noises, they may lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information, and they may not accurately perceive the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening the patient through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" performed by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using diverse measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may include questionnaires, observational assessments of auditory responses, and interactions with specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, consistently effective diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder. Many tests present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking patients to differentiate among items like words or numbers. Advanced evaluations involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the corresponding responses.",
            "I am committed to studying social work with the aim of building a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I hope to assist children facing abuse or neglect and lend support to families in distress. The values I bring to this field include service, respect, ethics, a dedication to fostering better relationships, and a personal commitment to ongoing professional development to ensure competence. These principles hold great significance not only within social work but also resonate deeply with me on a personal level.\n\nFrom a young age, I've felt a strong desire to help others, though I wasn't always sure which career would allow me to do so. During my time in high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems or resorting to ineffective coping strategies. These observations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Despite this, I remained uncertain about my career direction after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, so I took some time off. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained his situation: he was seeking refuge from abusive parents. The next day, he called the police to his home. Wanting to help, I went to his parents' house and shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent degree in Psychology. Since legal action wasn't an option, the police asked me to speak with the parents. They seemed anxious and provided excuses, labeling their son’s actions to involve outsiders as “manipulative” responses to minor family conflicts. This encounter pushed me to seriously consider a career in social work, focusing on helping children navigate family issues.\n\nSocial justice is another core value essential to social work. Society often emphasizes the importance of the individual and laments those who are lost, yet the societal notion of individuality often clings to outdated traditions rather than embracing true uniqueness. If society grieves for lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I value my individuality and resist conforming to societal norms. During my high school and college years, I stood against social injustice in various ways: expressing myself through unique hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting non-traditional ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and actively opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. Upholding social justice is a belief I am passionate about, and I remain committed to challenging social injustice.",
            "This essay explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks as they pertain to insomnia, a sleep disorder. The biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. In contrast, the Sociocultural perspective examines how environmental interactions relate to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. This analysis of insomnia delves into these models, discussing selected research that helps clarify and expand upon each framework. The research findings are then assessed to highlight their individual strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to other mental disorders, or those associated with other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those linked to other mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional sleep disorder categories may stem from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in falling or staying asleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy features symptoms like cataplexy and automatic REM. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are linked to behavioral or physiological irregularities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders associated with other mental disorders involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This review emphasizes insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological perspective on sleep disorders considers genetic, hereditary, and physiological elements. Neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wake states. A study involving mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are specifically involved in sleep/wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers sleep-promoting responses, and its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and enhanced sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was found to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that results from animal models can be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Issues or lack of this receptor could affect one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if this phenotype is inherited, receptor changes could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep, adversely affecting areas like education, career, and routine activities requiring sustained attention.",
            "I've been attending University Park for roughly two and a half years, which equates to about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is nearly at the eastern edge of campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building near the campus center could take up to 25 minutes, particularly when the weather was unfavorable, which is a frequent occurrence in State College. An alum who graduated not long before I did mentioned that East Halls dorms were once isolated by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been transformed into sports fields and large new buildings, such as the Creamery and a new health services facility, with apartments surrounding them. As campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What is the best solution for campus mobility? The answer lies in using bicycles. However, simply having bikes isn’t enough. Students need to utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nA friend of mine, who recently started cycling again after a break of several years, shared his thoughts. He questioned why he ever gave it up. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he remarked, \"although it wasn't trendy to ride one for a while, it's really the best way to get around.\" Besides being healthy, cycling is the most efficient travel method. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many students, I currently live off-campus, which is as far from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bicycle has been my smartest choice this year. Each day, I have a class in the Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I ride swiftly. The only challenge is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it can be a difficult road to navigate, whether on bike or on foot. While there are benefits to walking, my schedule is too packed to allow for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to reach class. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my time. That adds up to over two and a half hours weekly. Plus, there’s the additional time I'd spend walking to and from other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a dystopian future where technology and capitalism pose significant threats. The society depicted prioritizes the community over the individual, with citizens trained from birth to seek immediate happiness. People in this world are mere players in a grander scheme, bound by a single ideology established by the World Controller. Through a Marxist perspective, one can see Huxley's skepticism about the evolving economic systems of his era. Terms frequently used in Marxist theory, such as hegemony and reification, underscore the idea that Huxley's novel critiques emerging economic systems from his time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary people are unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, as they focus on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common workers, which is evident in the conditioning witnessed in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack true autonomy; through hypnopædia, their desire to consume and spend is prioritized above all. This is controlled by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that social classes are completely dominated by a separate group, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, quite literally buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes are aware but largely passive, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, meaningful relationships between individuals are absent. Major characters lack depth, suggesting that technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial. This is illustrated by men's comments about women focusing on their physical traits and women's open discussions about their encounters. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class with their hierarchical status reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete obedience to their societal roles aligns with Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A central topic of lively debate in the class was the question of whether Islam is a hostile religion. I find this question increasingly pertinent today. Reflecting on the events following 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the mass media's portrayal of Islam and extremists—from a hostile perspective to a more tolerant stance in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Borac Obama, hinting at a Muslim heritage, could have emerged.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me because it seems to contradict Muhammad's historical persona as I understood it. Previously, I was under the impression that Muhammad coerced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, who humbly engaged with others, leading people to recognize the 'truth' of his teachings and seek him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. A notable example is the episode where Muhammad supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to satisfy forty men. This narrative style suggests the writers sought to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, whose life was defined by truth and miracles, rather than needing validation. I find this portrayal problematic as it seems to undermine Jesus Christ's life and miracles, almost as if credit is being shifted from Jesus to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous anecdotes that appear to aim at demonstrating 'witness' or independent conversions to Islam. However, many of these stories are relayed from third-party perspectives, like a chain of hearsay. While intended to substantiate the authenticity of these accounts, I feel it instead casts doubt and makes the stories appear more questionable.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble leader. I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The original teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his life quickly became overshadowed as Christian thought evolved after his time. Observing this history broadly reveals a pattern of Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, we see an increasing awareness and an unprecedented push towards progressive thinking. While traditionalists persist and resist new ideas beyond their familiar teachings, they may not hold enough sway to shape the entire population. Among Christians, historical consciousness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to separate doctrines that were later added to Christianity from the original intentions of its founder. This process might take decades or even centuries, but it is seen as unavoidable: a significant shift in Christian history will occur, steering it back toward its foundational form. A movement will gain momentum, peeling away layers of added doctrine as if time were reversing, until what remains is the essence of what Jesus shared with humanity, before others claimed similar revelations. As this movement spreads across the United States and Europe, drawing people to worship as though they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will continue to guide the process. However, with this regression of theological development, the vast diversity within Christianity will gradually diminish, leading to more uniformity in beliefs and practices. Instead of highlighting differences across regions, denominations, and various divisions, growing similarities will emerge. Human history includes many examples of significant reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later embraced Christianity. Our nation has shifted from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming major reversion will unfold within the Christian religion, seeking its origins and reducing its diversity. This transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what transpired since Jesus' lifetime? Looking back, we see Judaism as the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. However, the Jewish population was not unified; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" illustrates the inherent tendency of humans to be greedy and self-serving. People are primarily concerned with improving their own circumstances without considering those less fortunate. This theme is exemplified throughout \"The Jungle,\" particularly in the portrayal of factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding and enhancing their enterprises, showing little to no concern for the consequences of their actions on others. Upton Sinclair's narrative conveys this indifference vividly: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair emphasizes the environmental devastation caused by pollution, highlighting the disregard owners have for the welfare of people and animals affected by it. They ignore the harmful smoke emissions and the animal waste runoff from the numerous pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe disregard extends to their workforce, whom they exploit to amass wealth. Their priority is maximizing profits, as depicted by Sinclair's observation: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure grueling hours only to be abruptly laid off, often without notice or severance. During the period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" labor laws safeguarding workers' rights were scarce, allowing management to impose harsh working conditions. Although the narrative does not explicitly state it, the residents of Packingtown were expected to endure these dire circumstances at work and in their communities. There were no supportive agencies or resources for laborers. Unions existed but frequently exploited workers, profiting from their plight. The workers, trapped in a system akin to slavery, had no escape: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finer poetic works. Within this poem, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in both lines 6 and 56, a reference that Mabbott links back to Virgil. In classical literature, Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island situated to the north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there exists a more contemporary source that deserves acknowledgment. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, which is significant in understanding his influences.\n\nThe importance of this reference lies in demonstrating Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his work \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes parallels between their poems, suggesting that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature highlights Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, with the first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who becomes despondent after his wife's passing, leading to heavy drinking and sorrow. Eventually, the king decides to die, bequeathing his possessions to his children except for a goblet, which he throws into the sea before closing his eyes and dying. The portrayal of the King of Thulé bears a striking resemblance to the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe’s own experiences with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's writings contain two references to Thule. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses this phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" effectively framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes a Thule landscape as dark, desolate, haunted by departed friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his desire to govern or live. The entirety of \"Dream-Land\" reads as if the narrator has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a pivotal literary figure Poe would have been acquainted with, if only due to his respect for Tennyson. Poe expressed his admiration for Tennyson, which suggests an exposure to Goethe’s works through the numerous versions produced following the original publication.",
            "In the context of California law, can a customer injured by slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages if it's shown that the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill and neglecting to address it for half an hour while having dinner? \n\nIt's unlikely that a judge will outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such an award, the plaintiff needs to demonstrate that the defendant's behavior was willfully and consciously indifferent to the likely harm it would cause, alongside proving the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have foreseen the potential harm from ignoring a spill, given that multiple customers at D&D had suffered injuries from slipping incidents in the months leading up to her accident. Despite this awareness, he failed to address the spill. Although the argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains plausible considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take adequate steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn the evening of October 13, 2009, at 5:00 p.m., Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin at 5:15 p.m., receiving the same response. By 5:30 p.m., Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Before Palmer's fall, five slip-and-fall incidents had already been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and the decision at hand is whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages for breaching a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice” as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as behavior intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, behavior that is “despicable” and executed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, particularly when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From a young age, she felt like something crucial was missing in her life. This yearning was persistent and unfulfilled, beginning around the age of 14 when she was navigating the early stages of adolescence. Even by 17, the feeling lingered. Over time, she realized it was not a thing she sought but a connection with someone. However, no boys caught her interest, despite several attempting to win her over in their awkward ways. She often pondered this peculiar situation, trying to understand why a teenage girl like herself felt this way. Years of reflection provided various theories, yet none seemed convincing enough. Thus, she continued her journey, always questioning her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents were peaceful individuals, rarely arguing with each other or with her, except when it came to her asserting her independence. She was the lively counterpart to her calm parents, her vibrant and engaging personality making her well-liked.\n\nYet today was far from calm. As she moved through the house, searching for fresh inspiration, a sudden scream from the kitchen pierced the air, her mother's voice. Panic set in as she rushed to the kitchen, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing in pain and repeating \"Ow\" with labored breaths. Instinctively, she rushed to help, placing a hand on her mother. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother managed to say, her voice strained. Recognizing her mother's distress, she asked where to lift her, grateful for her strength-training classes. Gently, she carried her mother to the car, settled her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the sterile scent of disinfectant and an undercurrent of anxiety. But she was too focused on her mother to notice. Swiftly, she carried her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Medical staff quickly surrounded them, placing her mother on a gurney and whisking her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to wait and worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a stepping stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf of their cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this research was to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and death from stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the traditional Med diet, emphasizing greater intake of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nEarlier prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total mortality and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, with one intervention trial indicating that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals with obesity. However, previous studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year duration. Validation studies were conducted on the FFQs. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through the review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were labeled \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was evaluated.\n\nTo minimize random variations for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from the previous two years. Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could introduce bias in results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was correlated with a decreased risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20 years of follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",

Burma, which is also called Myanmar, is located in Southeast Asia and has been under the control of a harsh military junta since they seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country experienced its first significant public protests in a decade, spearheaded by a large group of Burmese monks. These demonstrations became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the general public began to support the movement, and the government reluctantly permitted peaceful gatherings. However, the situation escalated into severe violence, with the military openly attacking and looting monasteries. Foreign journalists were detained, and Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, was killed during a protest on September 27, 2007. While official reports state 13 fatalities, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official report, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThese events are not isolated in history. The suppression of dissent by governments to maintain control has been a recurring theme throughout civilization. Roman emperors once declared divine authority over their societies. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, leading their people toward technological and cultural advancements. Meanwhile, in modern times, George W. Bush, the U.S. president at the time, held weekly discussions with Ted Haggard, leader of the group Stupid People Worldwide, an offshoot of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable historical parallels include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to oppose government authoritarianism. The death toll from that event varies, with Chinese government figures citing 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Additionally, the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militias, with government support, systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s 'Third Reich,' during which Jewish individuals were systematically exterminated across several countries, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz can be largely attributed to his enduring career and his remarkable talent in shaping his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence may be subtle in many of the pieces chosen for this assignment, his brilliance as a composer lies in his ability to craft intricate compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that drew on the distinctive styles of his musicians to emphasize musical concepts. This approach allowed him to focus on the overall tone of the orchestra, generating cohesive and innovative sounds for each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of each musician's sound and their role within the ensemble enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and ingenious works in the history of jazz.\n\nIn discussing Ellington's innovative sound, the Grove Music dictionary highlights \"Creole Love Call,\" an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" without the limitations of lyrics. This piece illustrates Ellington's skill in enhancing the style of his soloists, a quality evident throughout his career. The piece is a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition with six choruses:\n\n1. A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that becomes rougher towards the end.\n2. A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\n3. A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n4. The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n5. The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the original structure with a call and response between voice and reeds, featuring the voice utilizing the \"growl\" technique as an instrument.\n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending. Ellington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait prevalent in his work.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his expertise in orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color. A call and response sequence between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing merges the vocal quality of Miley's trumpet and the instrumental quality of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementing sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a cornerstone of Ellington’s orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone with great effect.",
            "What drives the evolutionary patterns we observe in living organisms? Are there particular limitations or factors that shape how these changes occur over time? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms was a task barely begun by zoologists, and this challenge remains today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been utilized to study the general process of mollusk shell formation across both individual development and evolutionary history, as demonstrated in works like those by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research is investigating the use of mathematical modeling on the developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum species. By integrating these models with experimental studies, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that guide the extent and direction of evolutionary changes. We employed X-ray images of Prunum species to extract quantitative parameters, which were then used to simulate both potential and actual shell structures. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program developed by Stone in 1995. Our models of hypothetical shell forms help us understand the limits of morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive research to enhance our comprehension of large-scale evolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that progresses through time, completing rotations in 360-degree space. The rotations of a coiled shell are termed whorls, spiraling around an imagined central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the core of the shell. The rate at which whorls expand differs, and a continuous line called a suture delineates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, referred to as the body whorl. All preceding whorls form the spire. The spire's tip is the apex, while the base is found at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Traditionally, the apertural view is most common, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex directed upwards.\n\nA technique for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apex and identifying the start of the first suture. A line is drawn to split the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to the nearest quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a succession of apertures moving through time and space as the organism builds its shell. One can trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center and the horizontal and vertical radii of each whorl's aperture.\n\nThis path can be depicted graphically and mathematically. With a mathematical model in place, it becomes feasible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Despite progress toward achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation improvements, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. This analysis will explore the various causes of these deficiencies and emphasize the importance of reinforcing the health system over implementing isolated program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers, now at 72%. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the ability to perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, which contributes to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage. Thus, the perceived progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, indicating much more work is needed. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional health treatment. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is another area of concern, with low coverage nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still below expected levels, around 4%, highlighting another issue. While urban areas have a 7% c-section rate, rural areas are at just 2%, indicating a disparity in healthcare coverage. Access to healthcare is concentrated in urban regions. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest, showing that socioeconomic status significantly impacts healthcare access, likely because of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering future strategies to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the primary question is how best to address service deficiencies. Should Indonesia focus on specific programmatic approaches or enhance the overall health system without targeting pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? Programmatic solutions are appealing due to their defined objectives and typically faster results. However, they have drawbacks, such as diverting resources from other health areas and concentrating human resources in more funded sectors, like the effect of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning. Additionally, running multiple separate programs for a single area can lead to redundant services and lack of coordination, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded to such an extent that it encompasses an overwhelming number of genres, making it challenging to catalog them all comprehensively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and further sub-categories within their realms. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most varied and expressive branches of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness is evident in its portrayal of a broad spectrum of emotions, often skewing toward the darker hues. Diversity in Heavy Metal emerged rapidly as people recognized its adaptability, leading them to innovate their own sub-genres, which then evolved into sub-sub-genres, continuing this trend to the present day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has fragmented into so many distinct niches that defining what constitutes heavy metal has become increasingly challenging. It has absorbed a multitude of influences from other genres, yet like all musical forms, it originated from a specific point. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends being merely a genre.\n\nIn several respects, metal is a movement characterized by its embrace of darkness. It can be described as music that embodies \"more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatrical elements. It shuns simplicity and highlights technical skill; musicians in metal bands are typically adept with their instruments, which is evident in their performances. Additionally, it may not come as a shock that metal is a movement significantly influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly wild and surreal records, with drugs often serving as a catalyst for such creativity. Metal music carries many dark, visceral attributes, which were relatively novel in the music scene, as much of popular music had previously avoided delving into the darker emotional territories. Furthermore, later iterations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent during the Romantic Era. The following lyrics exemplify the darkness integral to the movement:\n\nThese lines from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the Beatles' darker side, reflecting a tumultuous journey, often attributed to drug influence. This song is regarded by some as one of the pioneering Heavy Metal tracks. It was crafted in response to a Rolling Stones song that also explored heavier, darker themes. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their capability to match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include the song on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists and their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was ingeniously sculpting his own dreams, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. \"The Dream,\" a painting completed in 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist, not only illustrates a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal ambitions and aspirations as an artist. From the onset of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he encountered a significant internal conflict in his pursuit of these dreams. \"The Dream\" embodies Rousseau's lifelong internal battle: whether to adapt or emulate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished, or to remain creatively autonomous and distinct, forging his own path. \n\nTo understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, it is essential to be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class life (Shattuck 47). He had no formal artistic education; instead, he worked for the French government as a gabelou, a municipal toll employee, until he was forty years old, acquiring the misleading nickname douanier, meaning customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The passing of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left him with only one surviving child, a daughter named Julia, and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and renewal, he turned to painting as a refuge. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized the peasantry in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk artist with the hopes and aspirations typical of his social class.\n\nRousseau's fixation on gaining acceptance in the art community is understandable when considered in context: not only did he lack formal training and begin his artistic journey later in life, but he was also creating art alongside many other skilled and renowned modern artists. Despite years of effort, Rousseau did not receive significant recognition until around the same time that Matisse was establishing his own artistic reputation. In \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon argues that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art: \"Matisse aimed to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, whereas Rousseau sought to create works so conventional that he would gain admission to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Various eminent thinkers have often drawn parallels between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a deep link between truth and beauty. I feel there is a foundational basis for this idea. In his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" John Keats famously states, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from formal education or personal experiences. Yet, our grasp of ethics and aesthetics seems, as Keats hints, to come naturally rather than through conventional teaching methods. Ethics and aesthetics are more about describing than prescribing. When we delve into morality and beauty, we're generally trying to understand why a particular artwork or piece of literature is considered beautiful, or why certain actions are deemed moral, instead of creating a rigid framework for evaluating art or ethical conduct.\n\nImportantly, critiques of art or morality often fall short of fully encapsulating what makes something good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like composition, contrast, or its cultural significance, but these do not entirely explain why it is revered as great art. Often, when someone is asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, they might start with, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed analysis. I think that neither art nor morals can be wholly broken down into descriptions of their characteristics. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we attempt to characterize a literary work, there remains an ineffable quality. Similarly, I believe ethics shares this feature. Wittgenstein expresses this by saying, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This ineffable \"something,\" or je ne sais quoi, I propose, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality, and this transcendental quality is what links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI think the closeness between morality and art stems from our profound experience of both on a level that is intuitive, to borrow from Kant's terminology. They affect us in a way that is felt deeply but not easily articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in the literary arts. As McKean points out, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a robust and united nation, showcasing a diverse cultural heritage stretching from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This cultural tapestry extends from Cologne on the Rhine through Germany's heartland to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this rich cultural amalgamation, it's no wonder that contemporary Germany has roots in numerous sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans, Germania, is steeped in mystery regarding the origin of its name, a topic of much debate among historians and scholars. Tacitus suggested the name originated from a Germanic tribe once known as the Tungrians, who had been referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first documented the term “Germanus” in his account of the Gallic Wars, distinguishing between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes, who frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate the unconquered tribes. Some theories suggest the name signified a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar remarked: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Other interpretations link the name to the spear, or \"ger,\" used in warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly to the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning “to shout,” hinting at the Germans’ loud or boisterous nature (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, penned \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" in AD 98, exploring the origins of the Germans. He asserted that the Germans were likely indigenous, not intermingled with other races through immigration or contact. He wrote: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAs for departing Rome for Germania, the Romans seldom did so. Instead, they ventured into Germania for trade and occasional military campaigns, yet typically returned to their expansive empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they inhabited the Roman Empire's frontiers, exchanging land-derived goods and military service within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the play explores the notion that while disguises can be effective tools for deception over long periods, ultimately, one must discard these façades to avoid losing their true self. However, ceasing such deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Thus, an individual must choose between preserving their own identity and maintaining relationships with others. Some may react indifferently upon learning they were deceived, but others might not be as forgiving, feeling insulted by the entire ruse.\n\nThe issue of deception becomes particularly complex when it involves gender role reversal, raising significant questions, particularly: why? What drives a person to abandon their identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? For Viola, it serves as a means of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nViola, arriving in an unfamiliar place, chooses to disguise herself as a man to shield herself from potential threats. Although her plan is successful, it distances her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support network. Complicating matters further, she is so adept at her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might appear to illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. The text suggests that these characters might have latent desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario merely because he seems to be a man, or does she have unspoken feelings for women? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s portrayal of Olivia appears to satirize individuals of his era who judge others based solely on appearance.\n\nThis is further demonstrated by how easily Olivia transfers her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, subsequently viewing Cesario/Viola as part of her family rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "The harshness of German colonial rule has been highlighted by numerous commentators, particularly regarding the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nonetheless, it would be an oversimplification to characterize an entire colonial empire with a single description. The German colonial empire exhibited a wide range of policies and governance styles, reflecting its diverse geography. Educational opportunities varied significantly across the colonies as well. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British discovered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories received acclaim from writers of that era.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government took an active role in establishing state schools for the education of the indigenous population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies, which operated with minimal government assistance. The government, however, allocated considerable resources towards European education in the colony, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had enduring impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond the period of German colonial rule. While in other German colonies, there was a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a focus on recent research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere exists a considerable body of literature concerning education within the German colonial empire. Most of these early 20th-century sources, written during or shortly after the German colonial period, are in German. The primary objective of these early works was to describe the educational systems within these colonies. Subsequent writings in English broadened the discussion by conducting comparative studies of education across the different German colonies and providing more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work explicitly addressing the subject of this paper is Cohen’s analysis of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen examines the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining the unique characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of the area consisted of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected the relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide a historical example of two countries once embroiled in a prolonged rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The pinnacle of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other skirmishes occurred between the nations, gradually decreasing in intensity until just before World War I. This rivalry was fueled by fundamental disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31).\n\nThis situation mirrors many other instances where neighboring nations maintain longstanding rivalries. Countries that share borders often experience conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico, in this regard, are similar to other enduring rivalries between bordering nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American countries that have generally maintained favorable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences significantly contributed to the discord between the United States and Mexico, a challenge not unlike those faced by numerous nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that while Americans opposed fascism and communism in the twentieth century, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). Similar to the ideological and interest-based rivalry of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the conflict here was rooted in religious differences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, with both nations inheriting these sentiments from their colonial pasts, complicating the establishment of friendly relations between the two.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year period of rivalry, most of which involved territorial issues related to border raids and frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a significant issue until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). According to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually concluded when American interests shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "A decade and a half ago, I found myself confronting a sudden and unforeseen disability caused by an illness I had never heard of before.\n\nAt the time, I worked as a nurse. My decision to enter this profession was rooted in a deep-seated desire for the security and stability that were absent during my childhood. Growing up, I frequently heard the reassurance, \"You'll always find work; people will always need care.\" Despite aspiring to become a scientist or journalist—or perhaps a blend of both—I opted for nursing due to its perceived reliability.\n\nFast forward to the present, I am 46, single, with no savings to fall back on, and unable to continue working. Even now, after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I possess very little that I can truly call my own. I manage to get by, but each day presents a challenge to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. While many aspects of my life remain uncertain, one truth stands out: I would not have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. No matter how resilient you think you are, true crises can make you feel incredibly vulnerable.\n\nThe reality is that life will always present us with both major and minor emergencies. There are no absolute assurances, and regardless of how well-prepared one is, some obstacles are simply too large to handle alone.\n\nI strongly believe that in the U.S., we need to shift away from solely relying on government intervention, which, frankly, is showing signs of deterioration. Instead, I advocate for a revival of trust among Americans—encouraging us to help one another and not hesitate to seek assistance, rather than isolating ourselves to build metaphorical fortresses.\n\nWhile U.S. Conservatives often emphasize \"rugged individualism\" as the backbone of our nation, in reality, it was the empathy, mutual respect, and resource sharing that sustained our ancestors during tough times. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains reached the coast through collective effort, not solitary endeavors.\n\nTherefore, by all means, take precautions. I have done so myself, assembling a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. I have stockpiled flashlights, a variety of batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and means to cultivate a small farm and preserve your own food, it is a wise investment. Consider also a wood stove, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you prepare, take the time to connect with those around you.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly attachments and attained enlightenment, leading to the emergence of Buddhism. The most traditional school of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion has a history spanning around 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople partake in this event, which holds religious significance, even though Buddha never advocated such festivities. These variations extend from surface-level traditions to the core principles of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its doctrinal beliefs due to various influences, both from within and outside the religion, whether supportive or antagonistic.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use specific terms. Internal forces refer to influences originating from within the Buddhasasana, regardless of one's monastic status. External forces are those from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm Buddhism, stemming from negative perceptions. Benign forces are neutral, not aiming to harm or help, though they might inadvertently do one or the other. These concepts will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nTo begin, examining the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism is essential. Buddhists seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily includes the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka details disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka addresses Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life's inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is necessary to break free from Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to Sansara along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines life rules: laypeople follow five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks adhere to more extensive regulations. The central doctrinal element in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the truth of suffering in life; second, the attachment that causes suffering; and third, the possibility of overcoming suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In negotiations, culture is a key factor that must be understood. It is not a single, uniform entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it is. Simplistic statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" fail to capture this complexity. While cultural generalizations can be useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the specific relevance of culture to the negotiations and how cultural attitudes can influence the discussions. Encountering a foreign culture often leads to comparisons with one's own, which is a natural part of the process.\n\nGaining insight into a foreign culture or mindset might involve learning about its history or understanding its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, it is crucial to accept it and navigate within its parameters, especially during negotiations, and particularly when one has less bargaining power. When negotiating in a foreign environment, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also vital to understand that culture goes beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within the same country often have distinct corporate cultures. For example, some emphasize long work hours, while others prefer a more laid-back approach. Corporate culture can manifest in dress codes, communication styles (such as direct versus indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to specific charities. The diversity within American corporate culture, which varies from company to company and even from region to region, highlights the variety of thought within a single societal culture. Other cultures may seem more uniform, but this uniformity often invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is critical, as they explain why a culture behaves in certain ways. In cultures that value saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining might not rush to settle quickly. Considering these cultural tendencies is essential before negotiations begin. However, it is also advantageous for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening for St. Anselm's discourse on the existence of God. This perspective is shared by another thinker, Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments we will also explore. Since both philosophers support the same notion, our task is to decide which argument stands out as more compelling. To streamline our discussion, we'll assume they both agree on the existence of the God portrayed in the Bible. Broadening their concept of God beyond this specific depiction would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as both are based on defending this singular idea of God. It is important to note that while both philosophers present noteworthy points, neither offers a completely comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this assertion, let's delve into St. Anselm's central argument. Anselm proposes a pathway to understanding rooted in faith, suggesting that one can find evidence of God by introspection. He argues that since God exists within our comprehension, imagining His nonexistence is impossible. Although the language he uses can be complex and occasionally unclear, the main idea is that the evidence for God exists within our own minds. St. Anselm implies that we don't need to look beyond our own consciousness to discover the truth about God, as the existence of this deity is evident by reflecting on what we innately know to be true. External evidence is apparently unnecessary. This principle of accepting beliefs without incontrovertible empirical evidence is commonly referred to as faith within Christian literature.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a different approach. He claims that God's existence can be established solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This concept could be advantageous in evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by enabling the conversion of new believers through logic rather than relying on their acceptance of unproven beliefs. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments to support the existence of God: motion, causality, contingency, degrees of perfection, and order. In each case, he essentially illustrates that God's existence is a logical necessity. For instance, if you are aware that one piece of a puzzle is missing and you complete the rest of it, logic allows you to infer the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without physically seeing it.",
            "Writers often employ a variety of methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their audience regarding key themes. Some of these strategies prove to be more impactful than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs an array of such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald juxtaposes an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. At other times, he assigns symbolic significance to an object or concept and uses it to serve this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently utilizes this latter approach with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald constructs symbolic meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later leverages to remind readers of particular emotions associated with significant elements.\n\nThe symbolism Fitzgerald develops for white/gray revolves around the notion of uniformity; white is associated with elegance and a higher social class, while gray suggests something older and faded. He establishes this symbolic meaning early in the novel through repeated references. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted \"in white\" (p. 8)—in fact, white clothing is prevalent: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (p. 41) to Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (p. 36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (p. 30). The only notable absence of white is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (p. 40). Fitzgerald further clarifies the significance of these colors by applying them to ordinary, seemingly trivial subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (p. 56), the names on the guest list at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (p. 61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine’s apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—depicting uniformity (p. 28). He describes everyday people and places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy's past is described as a \"white girlhood\" (p. 19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (p. 23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" near the railroad is \"gray\" (p. 26), and a dog-seller is portrayed as \"a gray old man\" (p. 27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough symbolic weight, he uses them to convey themes of insignificance or conformity regarding specific subjects. This technique becomes apparent with Daisy. After a period with little emphasis on these colors, Fitzgerald presents Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view her as less of an individual character and more of a standardized aspiration for Gatsby (p. 74). Fitzgerald continues to use this method to portray Daisy as a uniform element, such as referencing the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (p. 18) and her wearing a \"white\" (p. 115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County stands out for its agricultural output, largely due to its favorable weather, characterized by mild temperatures and abundant sunshine. The area is known for growing a variety of crops, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a thriving demand for organic produce through community-supported agriculture in San Diego, leading to many local groups having extensive waiting lists. Organic dairy products such as eggs and milk are equally sought after. Numerous organic farms in the region offer tours of their facilities and provide opportunities for activities like hiking and birdwatching. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government initiatives while enhancing habitats, thus supporting recreational use and offering farm tours and educational programs as a source of income.\n\nIn addition to potentially tapping into a profitable niche market, organic farming is recognized for fostering greater biodiversity among plants and animals, attributed to the absence of chemical use in soils and water. Nonetheless, organic agriculture can entail higher expenses compared to conventional farming, as it demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses. Small-scale organic farms also lack the economies of scale found in larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife but not directly related to organic farming can also lead to increased labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats like edge areas or open patches. Therefore, there are multiple reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land for this scenario is a parcel near the town of Potrero, located in the unincorporated area of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This location is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently in review, which considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Several species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, certain butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others like burrowing owls are in decline and may soon be classified as endangered.\n\nHistorically, this area was home to Native Americans for countless generations before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 19th century. The land was included in an original homestead patent, suggesting its use for grazing or wood production over the years. To better understand what a small farmer might achieve on this land, I selected a property from a real estate website and explored available government programs to assess the options for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly practices. I also identified an organic farm nearby as a model of potential agricultural endeavors in this locale.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound and unyielding, encompassing a wide range of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other in ways unmatched by other relationships, seeing themselves in each other's eyes. It is during the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse, and these emotions come with significant consequences. Understanding these feelings involves confronting the outcomes they produce. When one gazes into a brother's eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves in their truest form, not as others see them. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship of two brothers, capturing the intense emotions tied to their bond. Amidst a richly depicted setting, the brothers embark on a journey that is doomed from the start. The story culminates in a scene where overwhelming disappointment collides with immense pride, with only one brother surviving. This theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reflect the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is largely driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From the first time he ventures out with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic outing, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a sibling to whom he could impart his skills, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He imagined a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or perch with him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, these aspirations are unattainable due to Doodle's frail heart, which made his survival uncertain and vigorous activities nearly impossible. This realization crushed the young protagonist's dreams filled with vivid fantasies. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle and briefly considers smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such a drastic act? Yet, his resolve softens when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that fills the protagonist with hope. This moment suggests that his previous intention was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he instinctively loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has developed from its early stages to the present day, the analogies used to understand the brain have also evolved. At first, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and most recently, a computer. While exploring the brain's functions, remember that these comparisons have their limitations and can sometimes lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins when sensory organs receive input and convert physical stimuli—like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons—into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory data through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when observing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the object's borders—where a sharp color change occurs—to conclude you're looking at a box. Top-down processing then uses these conclusions to help you quickly recognize the box. In this scenario, top-down processing may assist in identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its significance and determines the cognitive processes to which it should be directed. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. However, you might still hear your name in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention modulating the results repeatedly.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on the structure of the printed word, its sound, or its meaning. After being stored, information needs to be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a particular sequence of neurons briefly. It is hypothesized that long-term memory is maintained by the structure of specific protein types.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are based on how humans retrieve memories, others draw from computer science, and still others rely on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that nodes represent concepts, with links between them based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which might link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of major corporations. This recession lingers today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis was a result of imprudent and shortsighted political decisions that pushed banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans within a fragile financial system. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to underwrite and repurpose these loans into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, exacerbating the situation and affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to increase his popularity for re-election. To do so, the administration eased lending practices, inadvertently setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times noted in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the largest underwriter of home mortgages, faced growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend loans to low and moderate income individuals, while also dealing with shareholder expectations for continued profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"The government-backed corporation might encounter difficulties during an economic downturn, triggering a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending practices would inevitably lead to economic turmoil.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex mortgage structures that emerged. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used before the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This overexposure made U.S. households and financial markets susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities suffered greatly. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, amounting to about 30% of the country's GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transition into commercial banks with stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—a moment in storytelling where a writer might feel the urge to showcase their talent with captivating, even enchanting language. It can also be the section where readers might lose interest or feel the need to retreat, grumbling about the narrative. Dr. Merlin has been known to express frustration when faced with an overwhelming amount of detail, and not in a way that's enjoyable.\n\nExposition is not an ally to your storytelling.\n\nMany seasoned readers are familiar with the advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin occasionally finds herself mired in extensive sections where either nothing transpires or too much is conveyed. Exposition is like a mischievous imp whispering to the writer to get past the background information to reach the engaging parts (distinct from the imp on the other shoulder, which tempts the writer to divulge every aspect of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, generally through straightforward language. In films, this occurs when one character provides another with a significant amount of information, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nConsider an example: in a story, you learn that the heroine encountered her beloved at a specific place and time, they wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to unfold over two pages, with both characters receiving only a couple of dialogue lines each. You'd expect the author to dedicate time to developing the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions the depth of his love for his wife. Likewise, you'd expect the heroine to illustrate, in various ways, how his presence profoundly affected and enriched her life (especially if the narrative later explicitly states this). A well-rounded introduction to the husband's character would foster an emotional connection to his fate and offer insights into the heroine's character: what she cherished in him, the strength of their bond, hints of her thoughts, beliefs, and aspirations as seen through his eyes, and more. You would share in her grief over his death, deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance beyond the bare outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to provide that depth. (Glancing at the metaphor, sighs, and continues) It can be tempting to hurry through certain aspects. You might be introducing a new character, aware that he previously served in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, has been married twice with no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first broadcast was NBC 4, aired live on the morning of August 13, 2011. The leading story covered an incident involving a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. The coverage included his mug shot, portraying him in a negative light, and lasted for about two minutes as the situation was still unfolding. The report only mentioned that he had stabbed her multiple times and was subsequently arrested. The time allocated to this segment seemed fitting to me.\n\nThe second report involved an early morning shooting victim, Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests or suspects were reported, but a SWAT Team was investigating the crime. The coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might be related to the fact that the victim was a Black man or that the incident took place in a predominantly Black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white individuals.\n\nAnother story discussed a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, with details about the suspected location of the incident. It was determined that a .22 caliber rifle bullet had struck the helicopter, and Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter’s arrest.\n\nThe broadcast also included a weather update, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely intended as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAdditionally, there was a report about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on the suspect's race and skin color.\n\nThe final story involved Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who was sentenced for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, the report noted his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, which may have been an attempt to make the punishment seem harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, a detail I felt was unnecessary for the story.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund. However, it offers more flexibility as it can be traded on an exchange just like a stock. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share in a transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the typical mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs involves paying a commission, similar to stock transactions. One of the appealing aspects of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite the clearly outlined advantages, it's wise for astute financial investors to scrutinize whether these benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to assess if owning a single ETF is as beneficial as owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and if there might be better configurations of the same stocks for an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo analyze the ETF, including every holding would be cumbersome, so we've chosen to focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how accurately these ten stocks reflect the overall ETF IHF, we can normalize the current asset percentages to 100% and calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio solely comprises these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio solely containing the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, marking a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of these top ten holdings is .12 lower compared to the ETF as a whole. Preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio consisting only of these top 10 holdings might achieve a higher return with a lower beta. Nonetheless, there remains the possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically distinct from one another. To determine if these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100%, allowing us to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a noticeable decline in the submission of commuter logs during the third month of the project. This was somewhat disappointing, and it's unclear what exactly caused it. As winter set in on our New England campus, fewer people were likely commuting by bike or walking, which could partially explain the reduction. December is also the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with completing assignments and grading. It's possible that filling out the commuter logs simply became less of a priority. Furthermore, December is the start of the hectic holiday season, leading into a month-long break when many students and faculty are not required to be on campus. Classes pick back up in late January for the spring semester, which might also contribute to the lower number of logs submitted that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. Perhaps it's typical for a project like this to start with enthusiasm that gradually wanes. To address this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a campaign aimed at revitalizing interest, which successfully boosted log submissions that month. Thus, one of the obstacles we encountered was sustaining project momentum amidst both a natural dip in engagement and the specific challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks common in academic settings. Another challenge inherent in this project (or any initiative promoting alternative commuting) is that people value the autonomy and convenience of driving their own vehicles, a deeply ingrained cultural preference. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, including gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage services, an independent bookstore, and some national retail chains. It would have been intriguing to see how offering more substantial prizes, like a high-quality bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation—potentially alleviating the engagement drop we experienced. The prizes remained relatively constant throughout the project. If their value had escalated over time, it might have spurred increased participation. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing more significant prizes like a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially boosted engagement instead of seeing it decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I was particularly intrigued by the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly employ editing techniques to create visual illusions. My analysis mainly centered on detailing the stylistic features of most trick films and identifying the unique elements in some of the later ones. Typically, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to set environments, framed within a frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, and utilize long and medium shots, strictly adhering to the one shot equals one film principle. Nonetheless, some films from the early 1900s defy these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by trick films is their use of interior sets framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not following the subjects or objects. This setup, prevalent in early cinema, draws inspiration from theatre and, for trick films, from vaudeville and magic shows. A limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films usually move laterally and seldom approach or retreat from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays put.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots, with occasional medium shots. Close-ups are absent in any trick films from the Edison library. This approach mirrors theatre and vaudeville traditions, where audiences view the entire performance within the stage's confines. As in most early films, actors remain in the middle ground, precluding close-ups.\n\nGenerally, early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equating to a film, limiting their duration to about a minute or less, based on frames per second. This restricts the trick films' narrative or dramatic potential; they often focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot perceived by the viewer doesn't necessarily correspond to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might comprise several spliced together to create an illusion of appearance or disappearance. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a detailed examination reveals the transition point where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the viewer perceiving the entire film as one continuous shot.",
            "In The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its paradoxical nature. The Gothic style has faced a range of opinions—it's been criticized, celebrated, accused of lacking substance, and applauded for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as Burke notes. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blended elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances, establishing what would become the proto-Gothic genre and introducing a novel way of storytelling. Walpole integrated \"old\" theatrical aspects with 'new' realism found in 'modern' novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This genre often harks back to medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was released, \"gothic\" described a range of people, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary progressions. The Gothic's blend of theatrical elements and the novel's new ability to delve into characters' psyches is what has allowed Gothic literature to endure, appearing both outdated and fresh to readers far removed from its original context.\n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, or the training of an ideal knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. For Gothic writers, chivalry symbolized the noble, honorable, and skilled knight—qualities they felt were lacking in society, especially Walpole. By romanticizing the \"gothic past\" through chivalric ideals, a bridge to Romanticism is suggested, with an aim to better the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned about the future. Involved in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he may have believed that the moral integrity seen in the Gothic era was missing from contemporary society. This idea is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before encountering Frederic, readers learn he represents many chivalric qualities. He is portrayed as:\n\nFrederic is painted with numerous classic chivalric images; first and foremost, he is a prince who has endured hardships, been profoundly affected by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" character is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of activities involved in moving goods from the initial customer order through stages such as raw materials, supply, production, and finally to product distribution. The concept of supply chain management was coined by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He articulated the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and regulating the supply chain to effectively meet customer demands. This process hinges on six critical elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers employ these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nThe supply chain process begins with production, serving as its cornerstone. This phase determines the timing, rationale, location, and methodology for production. Managers must be attuned to customer preferences, which can be discerned by analyzing market trends—an invaluable indicator of consumer demand. Upon understanding market demands, managers decide which products to manufacture and in what quantities. It's then essential to choose an appropriate production facility that balances volume and quality, aligning with customer satisfaction goals. Once the production site is established, management shifts focus to scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. The meticulous planning of each detail in production is crucial to avoid significant time and financial losses. For instance, in my experience at Wal-Mart and Target, both retailers had systematic guidelines for every operational aspect, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes help maintain clarity and efficiency.\n\nThe next integral component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and develop outsourcing partnerships. A company might operate several production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, staff, and expertise. Managers must determine which division is best suited for specific product processes. Additionally, they might consider outsourcing to other companies to enhance velocity, which is the capacity to deliver quality and adaptability while minimizing or maintaining costs.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the period's aristocracy. However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are often regarded as Victorian yet deviate from this norm. These works incorporate elements of mystery and an unusual flair that are not typical of the era's novels. This approach enhances the depth of the characters, offering insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing thoughts flooded his mind. It seemed as if he were still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument: for the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he focused his attention, ... he realized he was speaking to them.... Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and all was chaos and commotion, as some invisible force hurriedly whisked him away. Through all these rapid visions, there persisted a vague, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him endlessly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the details and purposes differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these peculiar events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner struggles, his sources of pain, and his understanding of the true nature of the circumstances around him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while he seeks help. The passage highlights the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the severe state of his health, which is vividly depicted through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing his senses to the point where he is unaware of the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, as the pain is now an enduring presence linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises regarding whose intentions led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting underscores the idea that Oliver has little control over anything, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at risk. This passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as though old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of preserving his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it disappeared as soon as it arrived – and night descended once more; a night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I took on a role in an after-school program, where I tutored young students at the elementary level. My goal was to assist them in subjects where they faced challenges, though I was particularly strong in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a boy named Adrian, who I recall was in the third or fourth grade, because he was having significant reading difficulties. It soon became apparent that his issues were unusual; while he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, others were a complete miss. It was quite strange. Although Adrian was of Latino descent, he spoke perfect English, which initially puzzled me. Our progress was slow until I met his mother one day. While babysitting a handful of students who hadn't gone on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She couldn't speak English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills—I was still learning—we managed to communicate. At that moment, it struck me: Adrian's reading issues weren't due to a disability; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this realization made a significant difference for him, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's a reminder that these barriers aren't always as apparent as one might assume. Even for a child fluent in spoken English, reading can present a major hurdle. I believe we can all acknowledge this problem, but the question is, how do we address it? In Adrian's situation, the solution was straightforward: focused tutoring in English reading, especially on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who have limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is necessary to tackle this issue effectively.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is a valuable approach—not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual programs often surpass their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might be resource-intensive and not beneficial for the majority, this isn't true. If we implement these programs widely in classrooms, rather than treating them as exceptions, all students stand to gain. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Instead, it's feasible to have bilingual aides, tutors, or whatever title is suitable, to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, we're often introduced to the idea that something greater than ourselves exists, beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school to explore this concept, while others might go to Temple or search internally for answers. Many easily embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their parents. However, some of us outright reject these ideas, refusing to accept anything beyond our self-centered worlds. It's possible to adopt a belief system only to later shift to another. No matter the path, we strive to define ourselves through our personal views on spirituality. We seek guidance, hoping to move from darkness into light.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were on our porch, listening to rain drum on the tin roof while sharing cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain, flooding the plants around the porch. My father gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed both introspective and reminiscent. Over recent months, he had grown thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair thinning more than I recalled. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated and scared, unable to express how much I'd miss him, fearing that acknowledging it would make it more real. I hugged him, then sat closer, joining him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The treatments had not alleviated his pain but had extended his life a few months beyond doctors' predictions. I couldn't determine the value in prolonging his suffering. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I offered no prayers, convinced that if God existed, He had long stopped listening to me.\n\nI hadn't wanted to witness his transition from this life to another, so I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the end of the life that brought me into this world. I chose to remember my father by his life, not his death. I understood him more than others, even his family, and knew he wouldn't want me, his only child, to witness his passing. I isolated myself in my room for three days, awaiting the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an influential early advocate for Republicanism. Primarily an agriculturalist, his career in farming, coupled with a brief stint in politics, shaped his reputation for being vocal and committed to issues of personal liberty and governance. His belief in an agrarian society was central to his views on government. Taylor's efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to build an exemplary system, unencumbered by native traditions that might restrict the formation of self-governance. He was a fervent supporter of the natural rights of man, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one undermines them all, diminishing their collective value. Therefore, these rights should be beyond governmental reach. He argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and cunning, but that this should not be the case within a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor argued that government must recognize both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He was steadfast in his belief in a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He identified good principles as those safeguarding private property, enhancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. Taylor believed that a government founded on sound principles would function justly, despite being led by individuals driven by greed and self-interest. He saw self-interest as humanity's motivating force, deeming it harmful only when it led to the formation of sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others. A sound government was essential to curb man's natural flaws, requiring vigilant monitoring to prevent the introduction of detrimental principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He supported a highly limited Federal government, restricted to powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. Aware that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical, he also recognized the dangers of a simplistic, literal interpretation, which could become corrupt without considering the framers' intentions. Furthermore, Taylor viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind processing the scene in front of me without any particular emotion or connection. With a detached focus, I observed what lay before me, allowing thoughts to drift in and out of my consciousness almost as quickly as they appeared. It felt as though my mind was engaged in a fluid experience, absorbing the visuals without forming distinct, personal thoughts.\n\nInspired by an artist I once collaborated with, I invested in an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Ever since childhood, I had harbored a desire to draw, and this book offered insights ranging from the basics of using a pencil to the cognitive processes involved in interpreting lines. One of its techniques involved framing a picture with a square to simplify complex scenes, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen adjoining a dining room, into a more manageable image.\n\nIn that moment, as I looked down at the bowl before me, I found myself unable to apply that artistic frame mentally. Overwhelmed by the sight, I stood there in amazement. Just as Picasso explored his blue period and Monet had a penchant for greenery, I faced the origins of my own artistic journey, which I whimsically dubbed Work in Brown.\n\nWith my fingertips on the chosen tool, I felt muscles tense and relax as my hand moved purposefully, driven by creative intent. Water flowed smoothly, carrying away fragments to oblivion. My hand struck the toilet handle repeatedly, yet the stubborn brown package remained, clinging to the bottom like an unwelcome guest.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, standing with feet apart, and a green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I regarded the unpleasant bundle left behind in the Rite Aid restroom. After several more flushes and moments of quiet reflection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Straightening up, then bending over, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, reminiscent of a mother retrieving a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven.",
            "Young drivers face a significant risk on the roads, with multiple elements contributing to the high accident rates among teenagers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, a major issue is that the adolescent brain is not fully developed to deal with the complexities of driving. In addition to this, the lack of driving experience among teens leads to more fatal accidents, an increased likelihood of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road.  \n\nMoreover, teenagers are particularly vulnerable when they drive with friends—a common scenario. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. In response, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses, which limit the hours teens can drive and restrict them from carrying other minors as passengers. \n\nHowever, I view these provisional licenses as temporary fixes. The core problem lies in the fact that, statistically, the youngest drivers are not equipped to manage the responsibilities and dangers of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a standard driver’s license. According to USA Today, Zuckerman's research indicates that individuals under 19-20 years old often engage in risky behavior for excitement. It seems prudent to delay driving until this risk-taking behavior diminishes. If young teens continue to be licensed, we will see a rise in fatal accidents, with potentially alarming consequences in the coming years. By 2010, many children of the Baby Boomer generation will reach driving age, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.  \n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should drive. A provisional permit could still precede a full license, with a requisite number of driving hours, similar to current state requirements—such as California’s mandate of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given that teen driving statistics are concerning nationwide, a uniform national law could effectively safeguard teenagers across the country. The legislative solution I propose is not an unprecedented concept.",
            "This essay addresses three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the disorder is given. Then, the process of diagnosis is discussed, highlighting typical signs or \"red flags.\" The essay concludes by suggesting ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how well the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. It specifically refers to the perceptual handling of auditory data in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing, generating electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; the challenge lies in the brain’s ability to interpret sounds, such as distinguishing words or filtering conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing evaluations for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and created a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further encouraged research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various forms: affected individuals might struggle to pinpoint or hear sounds in space, have trouble distinguishing between multiple \"acoustic events,\" fail to recognize sound patterns, or find it difficult to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Sounds might be masked by subsequent noises, they may lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information, and they may not accurately perceive the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening the patient through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" performed by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using diverse measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may include questionnaires, observational assessments of auditory responses, and interactions with specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, consistently effective diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder. Many tests present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking patients to differentiate among items like words or numbers. Advanced evaluations involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the corresponding responses.",
            "I am committed to studying social work with the aim of building a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I hope to assist children facing abuse or neglect and lend support to families in distress. The values I bring to this field include service, respect, ethics, a dedication to fostering better relationships, and a personal commitment to ongoing professional development to ensure competence. These principles hold great significance not only within social work but also resonate deeply with me on a personal level.\n\nFrom a young age, I've felt a strong desire to help others, though I wasn't always sure which career would allow me to do so. During my time in high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems or resorting to ineffective coping strategies. These observations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Despite this, I remained uncertain about my career direction after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, so I took some time off. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained his situation: he was seeking refuge from abusive parents. The next day, he called the police to his home. Wanting to help, I went to his parents' house and shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent degree in Psychology. Since legal action wasn't an option, the police asked me to speak with the parents. They seemed anxious and provided excuses, labeling their son’s actions to involve outsiders as “manipulative” responses to minor family conflicts. This encounter pushed me to seriously consider a career in social work, focusing on helping children navigate family issues.\n\nSocial justice is another core value essential to social work. Society often emphasizes the importance of the individual and laments those who are lost, yet the societal notion of individuality often clings to outdated traditions rather than embracing true uniqueness. If society grieves for lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I value my individuality and resist conforming to societal norms. During my high school and college years, I stood against social injustice in various ways: expressing myself through unique hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting non-traditional ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and actively opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. Upholding social justice is a belief I am passionate about, and I remain committed to challenging social injustice.",
            "This essay explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks as they pertain to insomnia, a sleep disorder. The biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. In contrast, the Sociocultural perspective examines how environmental interactions relate to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. This analysis of insomnia delves into these models, discussing selected research that helps clarify and expand upon each framework. The research findings are then assessed to highlight their individual strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to other mental disorders, or those associated with other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those linked to other mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional sleep disorder categories may stem from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in falling or staying asleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy features symptoms like cataplexy and automatic REM. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are linked to behavioral or physiological irregularities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders associated with other mental disorders involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This review emphasizes insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological perspective on sleep disorders considers genetic, hereditary, and physiological elements. Neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wake states. A study involving mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are specifically involved in sleep/wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers sleep-promoting responses, and its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and enhanced sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was found to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that results from animal models can be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Issues or lack of this receptor could affect one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if this phenotype is inherited, receptor changes could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep, adversely affecting areas like education, career, and routine activities requiring sustained attention.",
            "I've been attending University Park for roughly two and a half years, which equates to about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is nearly at the eastern edge of campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building near the campus center could take up to 25 minutes, particularly when the weather was unfavorable, which is a frequent occurrence in State College. An alum who graduated not long before I did mentioned that East Halls dorms were once isolated by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been transformed into sports fields and large new buildings, such as the Creamery and a new health services facility, with apartments surrounding them. As campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What is the best solution for campus mobility? The answer lies in using bicycles. However, simply having bikes isn’t enough. Students need to utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nA friend of mine, who recently started cycling again after a break of several years, shared his thoughts. He questioned why he ever gave it up. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he remarked, \"although it wasn't trendy to ride one for a while, it's really the best way to get around.\" Besides being healthy, cycling is the most efficient travel method. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many students, I currently live off-campus, which is as far from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bicycle has been my smartest choice this year. Each day, I have a class in the Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I ride swiftly. The only challenge is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it can be a difficult road to navigate, whether on bike or on foot. While there are benefits to walking, my schedule is too packed to allow for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to reach class. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my time. That adds up to over two and a half hours weekly. Plus, there’s the additional time I'd spend walking to and from other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a dystopian future where technology and capitalism pose significant threats. The society depicted prioritizes the community over the individual, with citizens trained from birth to seek immediate happiness. People in this world are mere players in a grander scheme, bound by a single ideology established by the World Controller. Through a Marxist perspective, one can see Huxley's skepticism about the evolving economic systems of his era. Terms frequently used in Marxist theory, such as hegemony and reification, underscore the idea that Huxley's novel critiques emerging economic systems from his time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary people are unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, as they focus on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common workers, which is evident in the conditioning witnessed in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack true autonomy; through hypnopædia, their desire to consume and spend is prioritized above all. This is controlled by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that social classes are completely dominated by a separate group, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, quite literally buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes are aware but largely passive, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, meaningful relationships between individuals are absent. Major characters lack depth, suggesting that technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial. This is illustrated by men's comments about women focusing on their physical traits and women's open discussions about their encounters. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class with their hierarchical status reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete obedience to their societal roles aligns with Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A central topic of lively debate in the class was the question of whether Islam is a hostile religion. I find this question increasingly pertinent today. Reflecting on the events following 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the mass media's portrayal of Islam and extremists—from a hostile perspective to a more tolerant stance in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Borac Obama, hinting at a Muslim heritage, could have emerged.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me because it seems to contradict Muhammad's historical persona as I understood it. Previously, I was under the impression that Muhammad coerced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, who humbly engaged with others, leading people to recognize the 'truth' of his teachings and seek him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. A notable example is the episode where Muhammad supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to satisfy forty men. This narrative style suggests the writers sought to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, whose life was defined by truth and miracles, rather than needing validation. I find this portrayal problematic as it seems to undermine Jesus Christ's life and miracles, almost as if credit is being shifted from Jesus to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous anecdotes that appear to aim at demonstrating 'witness' or independent conversions to Islam. However, many of these stories are relayed from third-party perspectives, like a chain of hearsay. While intended to substantiate the authenticity of these accounts, I feel it instead casts doubt and makes the stories appear more questionable.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble leader. I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The original teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his life quickly became overshadowed as Christian thought evolved after his time. Observing this history broadly reveals a pattern of Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, we see an increasing awareness and an unprecedented push towards progressive thinking. While traditionalists persist and resist new ideas beyond their familiar teachings, they may not hold enough sway to shape the entire population. Among Christians, historical consciousness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to separate doctrines that were later added to Christianity from the original intentions of its founder. This process might take decades or even centuries, but it is seen as unavoidable: a significant shift in Christian history will occur, steering it back toward its foundational form. A movement will gain momentum, peeling away layers of added doctrine as if time were reversing, until what remains is the essence of what Jesus shared with humanity, before others claimed similar revelations. As this movement spreads across the United States and Europe, drawing people to worship as though they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will continue to guide the process. However, with this regression of theological development, the vast diversity within Christianity will gradually diminish, leading to more uniformity in beliefs and practices. Instead of highlighting differences across regions, denominations, and various divisions, growing similarities will emerge. Human history includes many examples of significant reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later embraced Christianity. Our nation has shifted from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming major reversion will unfold within the Christian religion, seeking its origins and reducing its diversity. This transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what transpired since Jesus' lifetime? Looking back, we see Judaism as the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. However, the Jewish population was not unified; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" illustrates the inherent tendency of humans to be greedy and self-serving. People are primarily concerned with improving their own circumstances without considering those less fortunate. This theme is exemplified throughout \"The Jungle,\" particularly in the portrayal of factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding and enhancing their enterprises, showing little to no concern for the consequences of their actions on others. Upton Sinclair's narrative conveys this indifference vividly: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair emphasizes the environmental devastation caused by pollution, highlighting the disregard owners have for the welfare of people and animals affected by it. They ignore the harmful smoke emissions and the animal waste runoff from the numerous pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe disregard extends to their workforce, whom they exploit to amass wealth. Their priority is maximizing profits, as depicted by Sinclair's observation: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure grueling hours only to be abruptly laid off, often without notice or severance. During the period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" labor laws safeguarding workers' rights were scarce, allowing management to impose harsh working conditions. Although the narrative does not explicitly state it, the residents of Packingtown were expected to endure these dire circumstances at work and in their communities. There were no supportive agencies or resources for laborers. Unions existed but frequently exploited workers, profiting from their plight. The workers, trapped in a system akin to slavery, had no escape: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finer poetic works. Within this poem, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in both lines 6 and 56, a reference that Mabbott links back to Virgil. In classical literature, Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island situated to the north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there exists a more contemporary source that deserves acknowledgment. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, which is significant in understanding his influences.\n\nThe importance of this reference lies in demonstrating Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his work \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes parallels between their poems, suggesting that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature highlights Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, with the first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who becomes despondent after his wife's passing, leading to heavy drinking and sorrow. Eventually, the king decides to die, bequeathing his possessions to his children except for a goblet, which he throws into the sea before closing his eyes and dying. The portrayal of the King of Thulé bears a striking resemblance to the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe’s own experiences with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's writings contain two references to Thule. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses this phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" effectively framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes a Thule landscape as dark, desolate, haunted by departed friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his desire to govern or live. The entirety of \"Dream-Land\" reads as if the narrator has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a pivotal literary figure Poe would have been acquainted with, if only due to his respect for Tennyson. Poe expressed his admiration for Tennyson, which suggests an exposure to Goethe’s works through the numerous versions produced following the original publication.",
            "In the context of California law, can a customer injured by slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages if it's shown that the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill and neglecting to address it for half an hour while having dinner? \n\nIt's unlikely that a judge will outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such an award, the plaintiff needs to demonstrate that the defendant's behavior was willfully and consciously indifferent to the likely harm it would cause, alongside proving the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have foreseen the potential harm from ignoring a spill, given that multiple customers at D&D had suffered injuries from slipping incidents in the months leading up to her accident. Despite this awareness, he failed to address the spill. Although the argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains plausible considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take adequate steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn the evening of October 13, 2009, at 5:00 p.m., Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin at 5:15 p.m., receiving the same response. By 5:30 p.m., Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Before Palmer's fall, five slip-and-fall incidents had already been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and the decision at hand is whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages for breaching a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice” as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as behavior intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, behavior that is “despicable” and executed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, particularly when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "From a young age, she felt like something crucial was missing in her life. This yearning was persistent and unfulfilled, beginning around the age of 14 when she was navigating the early stages of adolescence. Even by 17, the feeling lingered. Over time, she realized it was not a thing she sought but a connection with someone. However, no boys caught her interest, despite several attempting to win her over in their awkward ways. She often pondered this peculiar situation, trying to understand why a teenage girl like herself felt this way. Years of reflection provided various theories, yet none seemed convincing enough. Thus, she continued her journey, always questioning her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents were peaceful individuals, rarely arguing with each other or with her, except when it came to her asserting her independence. She was the lively counterpart to her calm parents, her vibrant and engaging personality making her well-liked.\n\nYet today was far from calm. As she moved through the house, searching for fresh inspiration, a sudden scream from the kitchen pierced the air, her mother's voice. Panic set in as she rushed to the kitchen, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing in pain and repeating \"Ow\" with labored breaths. Instinctively, she rushed to help, placing a hand on her mother. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother managed to say, her voice strained. Recognizing her mother's distress, she asked where to lift her, grateful for her strength-training classes. Gently, she carried her mother to the car, settled her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the sterile scent of disinfectant and an undercurrent of anxiety. But she was too focused on her mother to notice. Swiftly, she carried her mother inside, calling for medical assistance.

            "The purpose of this research was to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and death from stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the traditional Med diet, emphasizing greater intake of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nEarlier prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total mortality and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, with one intervention trial indicating that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals with obesity. However, previous studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year duration. Validation studies were conducted on the FFQs. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through the review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were labeled \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was evaluated.\n\nTo minimize random variations for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from the previous two years. Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could introduce bias in results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was correlated with a decreased risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20 years of follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "A sign claims Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, stands by herself at a street corner, holding a piece of cardboard above her head with the startling message scrawled on it in Sharpie. Burma, which is also called Myanmar, is located in Southeast Asia and has been under the control of a harsh military junta since they seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country experienced its first significant public protests in a decade, spearheaded by a large group of Burmese monks. These demonstrations became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the general public began to support the movement, and the government reluctantly permitted peaceful gatherings. However, the situation escalated into severe violence, with the military openly attacking and looting monasteries. Foreign journalists were detained, and Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, was killed during a protest on September 27, 2007. While official reports state 13 fatalities, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official report, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThese events are not isolated in history. The suppression of dissent by governments to maintain control has been a recurring theme throughout civilization. Roman emperors once declared divine authority over their societies. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, leading their people toward technological and cultural advancements. Meanwhile, in modern times, George W. Bush, the U.S. president at the time, held weekly discussions with Ted Haggard, leader of the group Stupid People Worldwide, an offshoot of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable historical parallels include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to oppose government authoritarianism. The death toll from that event varies, with Chinese government figures citing 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Additionally, the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militias, with government support, systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s 'Third Reich,' during which Jewish individuals were systematically exterminated across several countries, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz can be largely attributed to his enduring career and his remarkable talent in shaping his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence may be subtle in many of the pieces chosen for this assignment, his brilliance as a composer lies in his ability to craft intricate compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that drew on the distinctive styles of his musicians to emphasize musical concepts. This approach allowed him to focus on the overall tone of the orchestra, generating cohesive and innovative sounds for each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of each musician's sound and their role within the ensemble enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and ingenious works in the history of jazz.\n\nIn discussing Ellington's innovative sound, the Grove Music dictionary highlights \"Creole Love Call,\" an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" without the limitations of lyrics. This piece illustrates Ellington's skill in enhancing the style of his soloists, a quality evident throughout his career. The piece is a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition with six choruses:\n\n1. A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that becomes rougher towards the end.\n2. A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\n3. A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n4. The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n5. The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the original structure with a call and response between voice and reeds, featuring the voice utilizing the \"growl\" technique as an instrument.\n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending. Ellington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait prevalent in his work.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his expertise in orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color. A call and response sequence between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing merges the vocal quality of Miley's trumpet and the instrumental quality of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementing sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a cornerstone of Ellington’s orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone with great effect.",
            "What drives the evolutionary patterns we observe in living organisms? Are there particular limitations or factors that shape how these changes occur over time? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms was a task barely begun by zoologists, and this challenge remains today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been utilized to study the general process of mollusk shell formation across both individual development and evolutionary history, as demonstrated in works like those by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research is investigating the use of mathematical modeling on the developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum species. By integrating these models with experimental studies, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that guide the extent and direction of evolutionary changes. We employed X-ray images of Prunum species to extract quantitative parameters, which were then used to simulate both potential and actual shell structures. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program developed by Stone in 1995. Our models of hypothetical shell forms help us understand the limits of morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive research to enhance our comprehension of large-scale evolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that progresses through time, completing rotations in 360-degree space. The rotations of a coiled shell are termed whorls, spiraling around an imagined central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the core of the shell. The rate at which whorls expand differs, and a continuous line called a suture delineates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, referred to as the body whorl. All preceding whorls form the spire. The spire's tip is the apex, while the base is found at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Traditionally, the apertural view is most common, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex directed upwards.\n\nA technique for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apex and identifying the start of the first suture. A line is drawn to split the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to the nearest quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a succession of apertures moving through time and space as the organism builds its shell. One can trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center and the horizontal and vertical radii of each whorl's aperture.\n\nThis path can be depicted graphically and mathematically. With a mathematical model in place, it becomes feasible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Despite progress toward achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation improvements, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. This analysis will explore the various causes of these deficiencies and emphasize the importance of reinforcing the health system over implementing isolated program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers, now at 72%. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the ability to perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, which contributes to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage. Thus, the perceived progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, indicating much more work is needed. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional health treatment. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is another area of concern, with low coverage nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still below expected levels, around 4%, highlighting another issue. While urban areas have a 7% c-section rate, rural areas are at just 2%, indicating a disparity in healthcare coverage. Access to healthcare is concentrated in urban regions. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest, showing that socioeconomic status significantly impacts healthcare access, likely because of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering future strategies to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the primary question is how best to address service deficiencies. Should Indonesia focus on specific programmatic approaches or enhance the overall health system without targeting pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? Programmatic solutions are appealing due to their defined objectives and typically faster results. However, they have drawbacks, such as diverting resources from other health areas and concentrating human resources in more funded sectors, like the effect of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning. Additionally, running multiple separate programs for a single area can lead to redundant services and lack of coordination, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded to such an extent that it encompasses an overwhelming number of genres, making it challenging to catalog them all comprehensively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and further sub-categories within their realms. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most varied and expressive branches of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness is evident in its portrayal of a broad spectrum of emotions, often skewing toward the darker hues. Diversity in Heavy Metal emerged rapidly as people recognized its adaptability, leading them to innovate their own sub-genres, which then evolved into sub-sub-genres, continuing this trend to the present day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has fragmented into so many distinct niches that defining what constitutes heavy metal has become increasingly challenging. It has absorbed a multitude of influences from other genres, yet like all musical forms, it originated from a specific point. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends being merely a genre.\n\nIn several respects, metal is a movement characterized by its embrace of darkness. It can be described as music that embodies \"more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatrical elements. It shuns simplicity and highlights technical skill; musicians in metal bands are typically adept with their instruments, which is evident in their performances. Additionally, it may not come as a shock that metal is a movement significantly influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly wild and surreal records, with drugs often serving as a catalyst for such creativity. Metal music carries many dark, visceral attributes, which were relatively novel in the music scene, as much of popular music had previously avoided delving into the darker emotional territories. Furthermore, later iterations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent during the Romantic Era. The following lyrics exemplify the darkness integral to the movement:\n\nThese lines from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the Beatles' darker side, reflecting a tumultuous journey, often attributed to drug influence. This song is regarded by some as one of the pioneering Heavy Metal tracks. It was crafted in response to a Rolling Stones song that also explored heavier, darker themes. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their capability to match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include the song on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists and their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was ingeniously sculpting his own dreams, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. \"The Dream,\" a painting completed in 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist, not only illustrates a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal ambitions and aspirations as an artist. From the onset of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he encountered a significant internal conflict in his pursuit of these dreams. \"The Dream\" embodies Rousseau's lifelong internal battle: whether to adapt or emulate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished, or to remain creatively autonomous and distinct, forging his own path. \n\nTo understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, it is essential to be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class life (Shattuck 47). He had no formal artistic education; instead, he worked for the French government as a gabelou, a municipal toll employee, until he was forty years old, acquiring the misleading nickname douanier, meaning customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The passing of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left him with only one surviving child, a daughter named Julia, and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and renewal, he turned to painting as a refuge. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized the peasantry in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk artist with the hopes and aspirations typical of his social class.\n\nRousseau's fixation on gaining acceptance in the art community is understandable when considered in context: not only did he lack formal training and begin his artistic journey later in life, but he was also creating art alongside many other skilled and renowned modern artists. Despite years of effort, Rousseau did not receive significant recognition until around the same time that Matisse was establishing his own artistic reputation. In \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon argues that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art: \"Matisse aimed to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, whereas Rousseau sought to create works so conventional that he would gain admission to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Various eminent thinkers have often drawn parallels between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a deep link between truth and beauty. I feel there is a foundational basis for this idea. In his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" John Keats famously states, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from formal education or personal experiences. Yet, our grasp of ethics and aesthetics seems, as Keats hints, to come naturally rather than through conventional teaching methods. Ethics and aesthetics are more about describing than prescribing. When we delve into morality and beauty, we're generally trying to understand why a particular artwork or piece of literature is considered beautiful, or why certain actions are deemed moral, instead of creating a rigid framework for evaluating art or ethical conduct.\n\nImportantly, critiques of art or morality often fall short of fully encapsulating what makes something good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like composition, contrast, or its cultural significance, but these do not entirely explain why it is revered as great art. Often, when someone is asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, they might start with, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed analysis. I think that neither art nor morals can be wholly broken down into descriptions of their characteristics. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we attempt to characterize a literary work, there remains an ineffable quality. Similarly, I believe ethics shares this feature. Wittgenstein expresses this by saying, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This ineffable \"something,\" or je ne sais quoi, I propose, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality, and this transcendental quality is what links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI think the closeness between morality and art stems from our profound experience of both on a level that is intuitive, to borrow from Kant's terminology. They affect us in a way that is felt deeply but not easily articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in the literary arts. As McKean points out, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a robust and united nation, showcasing a diverse cultural heritage stretching from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This cultural tapestry extends from Cologne on the Rhine through Germany's heartland to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this rich cultural amalgamation, it's no wonder that contemporary Germany has roots in numerous sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans, Germania, is steeped in mystery regarding the origin of its name, a topic of much debate among historians and scholars. Tacitus suggested the name originated from a Germanic tribe once known as the Tungrians, who had been referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first documented the term “Germanus” in his account of the Gallic Wars, distinguishing between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes, who frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate the unconquered tribes. Some theories suggest the name signified a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar remarked: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Other interpretations link the name to the spear, or \"ger,\" used in warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly to the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning “to shout,” hinting at the Germans’ loud or boisterous nature (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, penned \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" in AD 98, exploring the origins of the Germans. He asserted that the Germans were likely indigenous, not intermingled with other races through immigration or contact. He wrote: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAs for departing Rome for Germania, the Romans seldom did so. Instead, they ventured into Germania for trade and occasional military campaigns, yet typically returned to their expansive empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they inhabited the Roman Empire's frontiers, exchanging land-derived goods and military service within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the play explores the notion that while disguises can be effective tools for deception over long periods, ultimately, one must discard these façades to avoid losing their true self. However, ceasing such deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Thus, an individual must choose between preserving their own identity and maintaining relationships with others. Some may react indifferently upon learning they were deceived, but others might not be as forgiving, feeling insulted by the entire ruse.\n\nThe issue of deception becomes particularly complex when it involves gender role reversal, raising significant questions, particularly: why? What drives a person to abandon their identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? For Viola, it serves as a means of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nViola, arriving in an unfamiliar place, chooses to disguise herself as a man to shield herself from potential threats. Although her plan is successful, it distances her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support network. Complicating matters further, she is so adept at her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might appear to illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. The text suggests that these characters might have latent desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario merely because he seems to be a man, or does she have unspoken feelings for women? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s portrayal of Olivia appears to satirize individuals of his era who judge others based solely on appearance.\n\nThis is further demonstrated by how easily Olivia transfers her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, subsequently viewing Cesario/Viola as part of her family rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "The harshness of German colonial rule has been highlighted by numerous commentators, particularly regarding the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nonetheless, it would be an oversimplification to characterize an entire colonial empire with a single description. The German colonial empire exhibited a wide range of policies and governance styles, reflecting its diverse geography. Educational opportunities varied significantly across the colonies as well. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British discovered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories received acclaim from writers of that era.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government took an active role in establishing state schools for the education of the indigenous population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies, which operated with minimal government assistance. The government, however, allocated considerable resources towards European education in the colony, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had enduring impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond the period of German colonial rule. While in other German colonies, there was a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a focus on recent research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere exists a considerable body of literature concerning education within the German colonial empire. Most of these early 20th-century sources, written during or shortly after the German colonial period, are in German. The primary objective of these early works was to describe the educational systems within these colonies. Subsequent writings in English broadened the discussion by conducting comparative studies of education across the different German colonies and providing more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work explicitly addressing the subject of this paper is Cohen’s analysis of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen examines the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining the unique characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of the area consisted of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected the relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide a historical example of two countries once embroiled in a prolonged rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The pinnacle of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other skirmishes occurred between the nations, gradually decreasing in intensity until just before World War I. This rivalry was fueled by fundamental disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31).\n\nThis situation mirrors many other instances where neighboring nations maintain longstanding rivalries. Countries that share borders often experience conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico, in this regard, are similar to other enduring rivalries between bordering nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American countries that have generally maintained favorable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences significantly contributed to the discord between the United States and Mexico, a challenge not unlike those faced by numerous nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that while Americans opposed fascism and communism in the twentieth century, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). Similar to the ideological and interest-based rivalry of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the conflict here was rooted in religious differences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, with both nations inheriting these sentiments from their colonial pasts, complicating the establishment of friendly relations between the two.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year period of rivalry, most of which involved territorial issues related to border raids and frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a significant issue until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). According to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually concluded when American interests shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "A decade and a half ago, I found myself confronting a sudden and unforeseen disability caused by an illness I had never heard of before.\n\nAt the time, I worked as a nurse. My decision to enter this profession was rooted in a deep-seated desire for the security and stability that were absent during my childhood. Growing up, I frequently heard the reassurance, \"You'll always find work; people will always need care.\" Despite aspiring to become a scientist or journalist—or perhaps a blend of both—I opted for nursing due to its perceived reliability.\n\nFast forward to the present, I am 46, single, with no savings to fall back on, and unable to continue working. Even now, after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I possess very little that I can truly call my own. I manage to get by, but each day presents a challenge to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. While many aspects of my life remain uncertain, one truth stands out: I would not have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. No matter how resilient you think you are, true crises can make you feel incredibly vulnerable.\n\nThe reality is that life will always present us with both major and minor emergencies. There are no absolute assurances, and regardless of how well-prepared one is, some obstacles are simply too large to handle alone.\n\nI strongly believe that in the U.S., we need to shift away from solely relying on government intervention, which, frankly, is showing signs of deterioration. Instead, I advocate for a revival of trust among Americans—encouraging us to help one another and not hesitate to seek assistance, rather than isolating ourselves to build metaphorical fortresses.\n\nWhile U.S. Conservatives often emphasize \"rugged individualism\" as the backbone of our nation, in reality, it was the empathy, mutual respect, and resource sharing that sustained our ancestors during tough times. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains reached the coast through collective effort, not solitary endeavors.\n\nTherefore, by all means, take precautions. I have done so myself, assembling a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. I have stockpiled flashlights, a variety of batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and means to cultivate a small farm and preserve your own food, it is a wise investment. Consider also a wood stove, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you prepare, take the time to connect with those around you.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly attachments and attained enlightenment, leading to the emergence of Buddhism. The most traditional school of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion has a history spanning around 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople partake in this event, which holds religious significance, even though Buddha never advocated such festivities. These variations extend from surface-level traditions to the core principles of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its doctrinal beliefs due to various influences, both from within and outside the religion, whether supportive or antagonistic.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use specific terms. Internal forces refer to influences originating from within the Buddhasasana, regardless of one's monastic status. External forces are those from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm Buddhism, stemming from negative perceptions. Benign forces are neutral, not aiming to harm or help, though they might inadvertently do one or the other. These concepts will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nTo begin, examining the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism is essential. Buddhists seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily includes the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka details disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka addresses Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life's inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is necessary to break free from Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to Sansara along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines life rules: laypeople follow five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks adhere to more extensive regulations. The central doctrinal element in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the truth of suffering in life; second, the attachment that causes suffering; and third, the possibility of overcoming suffering."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In negotiations, culture is a key factor that must be understood. It is not a single, uniform entity, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that can be defined as much by what it is not as by what it is. Simplistic statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" fail to capture this complexity. While cultural generalizations can be useful, it is more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the specific relevance of culture to the negotiations and how cultural attitudes can influence the discussions. Encountering a foreign culture often leads to comparisons with one's own, which is a natural part of the process.\n\nGaining insight into a foreign culture or mindset might involve learning about its history or understanding its biases. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, it is crucial to accept it and navigate within its parameters, especially during negotiations, and particularly when one has less bargaining power. When negotiating in a foreign environment, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance the negotiation.\n\nIt's also vital to understand that culture goes beyond national or international boundaries. Companies within the same country often have distinct corporate cultures. For example, some emphasize long work hours, while others prefer a more laid-back approach. Corporate culture can manifest in dress codes, communication styles (such as direct versus indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others limit it to specific charities. The diversity within American corporate culture, which varies from company to company and even from region to region, highlights the variety of thought within a single societal culture. Other cultures may seem more uniform, but this uniformity often invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is critical, as they explain why a culture behaves in certain ways. In cultures that value saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid publicly embarrassing their company or superior. Similarly, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining might not rush to settle quickly. Considering these cultural tendencies is essential before negotiations begin. However, it is also advantageous for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and serves as the opening for St. Anselm's discourse on the existence of God. This perspective is shared by another thinker, Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments we will also explore. Since both philosophers support the same notion, our task is to decide which argument stands out as more compelling. To streamline our discussion, we'll assume they both agree on the existence of the God portrayed in the Bible. Broadening their concept of God beyond this specific depiction would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as both are based on defending this singular idea of God. It is important to note that while both philosophers present noteworthy points, neither offers a completely comprehensive foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo clarify this assertion, let's delve into St. Anselm's central argument. Anselm proposes a pathway to understanding rooted in faith, suggesting that one can find evidence of God by introspection. He argues that since God exists within our comprehension, imagining His nonexistence is impossible. Although the language he uses can be complex and occasionally unclear, the main idea is that the evidence for God exists within our own minds. St. Anselm implies that we don't need to look beyond our own consciousness to discover the truth about God, as the existence of this deity is evident by reflecting on what we innately know to be true. External evidence is apparently unnecessary. This principle of accepting beliefs without incontrovertible empirical evidence is commonly referred to as faith within Christian literature.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a different approach. He claims that God's existence can be established solely through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This concept could be advantageous in evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by enabling the conversion of new believers through logic rather than relying on their acceptance of unproven beliefs. Aquinas outlines five logical arguments to support the existence of God: motion, causality, contingency, degrees of perfection, and order. In each case, he essentially illustrates that God's existence is a logical necessity. For instance, if you are aware that one piece of a puzzle is missing and you complete the rest of it, logic allows you to infer the characteristics and existence of the missing piece without physically seeing it.",
            "Writers often employ a variety of methods to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in their audience regarding key themes. Some of these strategies prove to be more impactful than others. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs an array of such techniques. Occasionally, Fitzgerald juxtaposes an adjective with a noun in an unconventional way to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. At other times, he assigns symbolic significance to an object or concept and uses it to serve this purpose. Fitzgerald frequently utilizes this latter approach with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald constructs symbolic meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later leverages to remind readers of particular emotions associated with significant elements.\n\nThe symbolism Fitzgerald develops for white/gray revolves around the notion of uniformity; white is associated with elegance and a higher social class, while gray suggests something older and faded. He establishes this symbolic meaning early in the novel through repeated references. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted \"in white\" (p. 8)—in fact, white clothing is prevalent: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (p. 41) to Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (p. 36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (p. 30). The only notable absence of white is during Nick's initial impressions of Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (p. 40). Fitzgerald further clarifies the significance of these colors by applying them to ordinary, seemingly trivial subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (p. 56), the names on the guest list at Gatsby's parties are now \"gray names\" (p. 61) on Nick’s timetable, and Catherine’s apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—depicting uniformity (p. 28). He describes everyday people and places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy's past is described as a \"white girlhood\" (p. 19), there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (p. 23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" near the railroad is \"gray\" (p. 26), and a dog-seller is portrayed as \"a gray old man\" (p. 27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has imbued white/gray with enough symbolic weight, he uses them to convey themes of insignificance or conformity regarding specific subjects. This technique becomes apparent with Daisy. After a period with little emphasis on these colors, Fitzgerald presents Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to view her as less of an individual character and more of a standardized aspiration for Gatsby (p. 74). Fitzgerald continues to use this method to portray Daisy as a uniform element, such as referencing the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (p. 18) and her wearing a \"white\" (p. 115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County stands out for its agricultural output, largely due to its favorable weather, characterized by mild temperatures and abundant sunshine. The area is known for growing a variety of crops, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a thriving demand for organic produce through community-supported agriculture in San Diego, leading to many local groups having extensive waiting lists. Organic dairy products such as eggs and milk are equally sought after. Numerous organic farms in the region offer tours of their facilities and provide opportunities for activities like hiking and birdwatching. Such operations enable landowners to benefit from government initiatives while enhancing habitats, thus supporting recreational use and offering farm tours and educational programs as a source of income.\n\nIn addition to potentially tapping into a profitable niche market, organic farming is recognized for fostering greater biodiversity among plants and animals, attributed to the absence of chemical use in soils and water. Nonetheless, organic agriculture can entail higher expenses compared to conventional farming, as it demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses. Small-scale organic farms also lack the economies of scale found in larger operations. Practices beneficial to wildlife but not directly related to organic farming can also lead to increased labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats like edge areas or open patches. Therefore, there are multiple reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert advice to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land for this scenario is a parcel near the town of Potrero, located in the unincorporated area of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This location is part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently in review, which considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Several species, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, certain butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher, are endangered, while others like burrowing owls are in decline and may soon be classified as endangered.\n\nHistorically, this area was home to Native Americans for countless generations before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 19th century. The land was included in an original homestead patent, suggesting its use for grazing or wood production over the years.

            "The connection between brothers is profound and unyielding, encompassing a wide range of emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other in ways unmatched by other relationships, seeing themselves in each other's eyes. It is during the most critical moments that the true essence of this bond is revealed, whether for better or worse, and these emotions come with significant consequences. Understanding these feelings involves confronting the outcomes they produce. When one gazes into a brother's eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves in their truest form, not as others see them. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the relationship of two brothers, capturing the intense emotions tied to their bond. Amidst a richly depicted setting, the brothers embark on a journey that is doomed from the start. The story culminates in a scene where overwhelming disappointment collides with immense pride, with only one brother surviving. This theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reflect the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of the world, both of which heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is largely driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From the first time he ventures out with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic outing, he harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a sibling to whom he could impart his skills, like \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He imagined a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or perch with him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, these aspirations are unattainable due to Doodle's frail heart, which made his survival uncertain and vigorous activities nearly impossible. This realization crushed the young protagonist's dreams filled with vivid fantasies. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle and briefly considers smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would contemplate such a drastic act? Yet, his resolve softens when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that fills the protagonist with hope. This moment suggests that his previous intention was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he instinctively loved his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has developed from its early stages to the present day, the analogies used to understand the brain have also evolved. At first, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and most recently, a computer. While exploring the brain's functions, remember that these comparisons have their limitations and can sometimes lead to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins when sensory organs receive input and convert physical stimuli—like touch, heat, sound waves, or light photons—into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory data through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when observing a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the object's borders—where a sharp color change occurs—to conclude you're looking at a box. Top-down processing then uses these conclusions to help you quickly recognize the box. In this scenario, top-down processing may assist in identifying the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter evaluates its significance and determines the cognitive processes to which it should be directed. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. However, you might still hear your name in a noisy room. Processing occurs in multiple stages, with attention modulating the results repeatedly.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding methods for each type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on the structure of the printed word, its sound, or its meaning. After being stored, information needs to be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through a particular sequence of neurons briefly. It is hypothesized that long-term memory is maintained by the structure of specific protein types.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are based on how humans retrieve memories, others draw from computer science, and still others rely on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that nodes represent concepts, with links between them based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which might link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial crisis, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of major corporations. This recession lingers today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis was a result of imprudent and shortsighted political decisions that pushed banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans within a fragile financial system. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to underwrite and repurpose these loans into complex financial instruments like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, exacerbating the situation and affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis trace back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to increase his popularity for re-election. To do so, the administration eased lending practices, inadvertently setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times noted in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the largest underwriter of home mortgages, faced growing pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend loans to low and moderate income individuals, while also dealing with shareholder expectations for continued profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"The government-backed corporation might encounter difficulties during an economic downturn, triggering a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier, and as Holmes anticipated, reckless lending practices would inevitably lead to economic turmoil.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex mortgage structures that emerged. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used before the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This overexposure made U.S. households and financial markets susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities suffered greatly. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, amounting to about 30% of the country's GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to transition into commercial banks with stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—a moment in storytelling where a writer might feel the urge to showcase their talent with captivating, even enchanting language. It can also be the section where readers might lose interest or feel the need to retreat, grumbling about the narrative. Dr. Merlin has been known to express frustration when faced with an overwhelming amount of detail, and not in a way that's enjoyable.\n\nExposition is not an ally to your storytelling.\n\nMany seasoned readers are familiar with the advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin occasionally finds herself mired in extensive sections where either nothing transpires or too much is conveyed. Exposition is like a mischievous imp whispering to the writer to get past the background information to reach the engaging parts (distinct from the imp on the other shoulder, which tempts the writer to divulge every aspect of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, generally through straightforward language. In films, this occurs when one character provides another with a significant amount of information, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nConsider an example: in a story, you learn that the heroine encountered her beloved at a specific place and time, they wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to unfold over two pages, with both characters receiving only a couple of dialogue lines each. You'd expect the author to dedicate time to developing the husband's character, demonstrating through his words and actions the depth of his love for his wife. Likewise, you'd expect the heroine to illustrate, in various ways, how his presence profoundly affected and enriched her life (especially if the narrative later explicitly states this). A well-rounded introduction to the husband's character would foster an emotional connection to his fate and offer insights into the heroine's character: what she cherished in him, the strength of their bond, hints of her thoughts, beliefs, and aspirations as seen through his eyes, and more. You would share in her grief over his death, deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance beyond the bare outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your responsibility to provide that depth. (Glancing at the metaphor, sighs, and continues) It can be tempting to hurry through certain aspects. You might be introducing a new character, aware that he previously served in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, has been married twice with no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first broadcast was NBC 4, aired live on the morning of August 13, 2011. The leading story covered an incident involving a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife, though her name was not mentioned. The coverage included his mug shot, portraying him in a negative light, and lasted for about two minutes as the situation was still unfolding. The report only mentioned that he had stabbed her multiple times and was subsequently arrested. The time allocated to this segment seemed fitting to me.\n\nThe second report involved an early morning shooting victim, Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, no arrests or suspects were reported, but a SWAT Team was investigating the crime. The coverage seemed brief, which I suspect might be related to the fact that the victim was a Black man or that the incident took place in a predominantly Black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention compared to similar incidents involving white individuals.\n\nAnother story discussed a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, with details about the suspected location of the incident. It was determined that a .22 caliber rifle bullet had struck the helicopter, and Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter’s arrest.\n\nThe broadcast also included a weather update, predicting rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. This segment was brief, likely intended as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nAdditionally, there was a report about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on the suspect's race and skin color.\n\nThe final story involved Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who was sentenced for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, the report noted his sentence as \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, which may have been an attempt to make the punishment seem harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, a detail I felt was unnecessary for the story.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund. However, it offers more flexibility as it can be traded on an exchange just like a stock. ETFs combine the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and even purchase a single share in a transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the typical mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs involves paying a commission, similar to stock transactions. One of the appealing aspects of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite the clearly outlined advantages, it's wise for astute financial investors to scrutinize whether these benefits, such as diversification, truly exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will look at the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to assess if owning a single ETF is as beneficial as owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and if there might be better configurations of the same stocks for an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo analyze the ETF, including every holding would be cumbersome, so we've chosen to focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Below are the top 10 holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how accurately these ten stocks reflect the overall ETF IHF, we can normalize the current asset percentages to 100% and calculate each stock's contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio solely comprises these 10 stocks in the proportions set by the ETF's holdings. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio solely containing the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF itself, marking a 16% increase in returns. It also shows that the Beta of these top ten holdings is .12 lower compared to the ETF as a whole. Preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio consisting only of these top 10 holdings might achieve a higher return with a lower beta. Nonetheless, there remains the possibility that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically distinct from one another. To determine if these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100%, allowing us to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, there was a noticeable decline in the submission of commuter logs during the third month of the project. This was somewhat disappointing, and it's unclear what exactly caused it. As winter set in on our New England campus, fewer people were likely commuting by bike or walking, which could partially explain the reduction. December is also the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with completing assignments and grading. It's possible that filling out the commuter logs simply became less of a priority. Furthermore, December is the start of the hectic holiday season, leading into a month-long break when many students and faculty are not required to be on campus. Classes pick back up in late January for the spring semester, which might also contribute to the lower number of logs submitted that month. However, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. Perhaps it's typical for a project like this to start with enthusiasm that gradually wanes. To address this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a campaign aimed at revitalizing interest, which successfully boosted log submissions that month. Thus, one of the obstacles we encountered was sustaining project momentum amidst both a natural dip in engagement and the specific challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks common in academic settings. Another challenge inherent in this project (or any initiative promoting alternative commuting) is that people value the autonomy and convenience of driving their own vehicles, a deeply ingrained cultural preference. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, including gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage services, an independent bookstore, and some national retail chains. It would have been intriguing to see how offering more substantial prizes, like a high-quality bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car, might have influenced participation—potentially alleviating the engagement drop we experienced. The prizes remained relatively constant throughout the project. If their value had escalated over time, it might have spurred increased participation. While the gift cards were sufficient at the project's start, announcing more significant prizes like a couple of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have potentially boosted engagement instead of seeing it decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I was particularly intrigued by the trick films, totaling fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly employ editing techniques to create visual illusions. My analysis mainly centered on detailing the stylistic features of most trick films and identifying the unique elements in some of the later ones. Typically, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to set environments, framed within a frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, and utilize long and medium shots, strictly adhering to the one shot equals one film principle. Nonetheless, some films from the early 1900s defy these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by trick films is their use of interior sets framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not following the subjects or objects. This setup, prevalent in early cinema, draws inspiration from theatre and, for trick films, from vaudeville and magic shows. A limitation of this stage-based approach is that characters in trick films usually move laterally and seldom approach or retreat from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays put.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also results in predominantly long shots, with occasional medium shots. Close-ups are absent in any trick films from the Edison library. This approach mirrors theatre and vaudeville traditions, where audiences view the entire performance within the stage's confines. As in most early films, actors remain in the middle ground, precluding close-ups.\n\nGenerally, early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equating to a film, limiting their duration to about a minute or less, based on frames per second. This restricts the trick films' narrative or dramatic potential; they often focus on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing acts, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot perceived by the viewer doesn't necessarily correspond to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might comprise several spliced together to create an illusion of appearance or disappearance. In The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a detailed examination reveals the transition point where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the viewer perceiving the entire film as one continuous shot.",
            "In The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its paradoxical nature. The Gothic style has faced a range of opinions—it's been criticized, celebrated, accused of lacking substance, and applauded for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as Burke notes. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blended elements from both \"ancient and modern\" romances, establishing what would become the proto-Gothic genre and introducing a novel way of storytelling. Walpole integrated \"old\" theatrical aspects with 'new' realism found in 'modern' novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This genre often harks back to medieval Gothic theater, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was released, \"gothic\" described a range of people, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary progressions. The Gothic's blend of theatrical elements and the novel's new ability to delve into characters' psyches is what has allowed Gothic literature to endure, appearing both outdated and fresh to readers far removed from its original context.\n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, or the training of an ideal knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. For Gothic writers, chivalry symbolized the noble, honorable, and skilled knight—qualities they felt were lacking in society, especially Walpole. By romanticizing the \"gothic past\" through chivalric ideals, a bridge to Romanticism is suggested, with an aim to better the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was amidst political turmoil and concerned about the future. Involved in politics and possibly facing unjust accusations, he may have believed that the moral integrity seen in the Gothic era was missing from contemporary society. This idea is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before encountering Frederic, readers learn he represents many chivalric qualities. He is portrayed as:\n\nFrederic is painted with numerous classic chivalric images; first and foremost, he is a prince who has endured hardships, been profoundly affected by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The \"gallant and courteous Knight\" character is exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses the series of activities involved in moving goods from the initial customer order through stages such as raw materials, supply, production, and finally to product distribution. The concept of supply chain management was coined by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He articulated the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and regulating the supply chain to effectively meet customer demands. This process hinges on six critical elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers employ these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nThe supply chain process begins with production, serving as its cornerstone. This phase determines the timing, rationale, location, and methodology for production. Managers must be attuned to customer preferences, which can be discerned by analyzing market trends—an invaluable indicator of consumer demand. Upon understanding market demands, managers decide which products to manufacture and in what quantities. It's then essential to choose an appropriate production facility that balances volume and quality, aligning with customer satisfaction goals. Once the production site is established, management shifts focus to scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. The meticulous planning of each detail in production is crucial to avoid significant time and financial losses. For instance, in my experience at Wal-Mart and Target, both retailers had systematic guidelines for every operational aspect, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes help maintain clarity and efficiency.\n\nThe next integral component of supply chain management is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and develop outsourcing partnerships. A company might operate several production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, staff, and expertise. Managers must determine which division is best suited for specific product processes. Additionally, they might consider outsourcing to other companies to enhance velocity, which is the capacity to deliver quality and adaptability while minimizing or maintaining costs.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the period's aristocracy. However, two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are often regarded as Victorian yet deviate from this norm. These works incorporate elements of mystery and an unusual flair that are not typical of the era's novels. This approach enhances the depth of the characters, offering insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing thoughts flooded his mind. It seemed as if he were still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument: for the very words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he focused his attention, ... he realized he was speaking to them.... Suddenly, he was startled by the sound of gunfire; loud cries and shouts filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and all was chaos and commotion, as some invisible force hurriedly whisked him away. Through all these rapid visions, there persisted a vague, uneasy awareness of pain, which wearied and tormented him endlessly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the details and purposes differ in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these peculiar events often reveal insights into Oliver's inner struggles, his sources of pain, and his understanding of the true nature of the circumstances around him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while he seeks help. The passage highlights the lack of control Oliver had over the unfolding events, as well as the severe state of his health, which is vividly depicted through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, numbing his senses to the point where he is unaware of the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, as the pain is now an enduring presence linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed, the question arises regarding whose intentions led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting underscores the idea that Oliver has little control over anything, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at risk. This passage also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as though old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of preserving his own life.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it disappeared as soon as it arrived – and night descended once more; a night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I took on a role in an after-school program, where I tutored young students at the elementary level. My goal was to assist them in subjects where they faced challenges, though I was particularly strong in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a boy named Adrian, who I recall was in the third or fourth grade, because he was having significant reading difficulties. It soon became apparent that his issues were unusual; while he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, others were a complete miss. It was quite strange. Although Adrian was of Latino descent, he spoke perfect English, which initially puzzled me. Our progress was slow until I met his mother one day. While babysitting a handful of students who hadn't gone on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She couldn't speak English, only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills—I was still learning—we managed to communicate. At that moment, it struck me: Adrian's reading issues weren't due to a disability; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this realization made a significant difference for him, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It's a reminder that these barriers aren't always as apparent as one might assume. Even for a child fluent in spoken English, reading can present a major hurdle. I believe we can all acknowledge this problem, but the question is, how do we address it? In Adrian's situation, the solution was straightforward: focused tutoring in English reading, especially on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who have limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no single answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is necessary to tackle this issue effectively.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is a valuable approach—not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual programs often surpass their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might be resource-intensive and not beneficial for the majority, this isn't true. If we implement these programs widely in classrooms, rather than treating them as exceptions, all students stand to gain. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Instead, it's feasible to have bilingual aides, tutors, or whatever title is suitable, to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, we're often introduced to the idea that something greater than ourselves exists, beyond our understanding. Some of us attend Sunday school to explore this concept, while others might go to Temple or search internally for answers. Many easily embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their parents. However, some of us outright reject these ideas, refusing to accept anything beyond our self-centered worlds. It's possible to adopt a belief system only to later shift to another. No matter the path, we strive to define ourselves through our personal views on spirituality. We seek guidance, hoping to move from darkness into light.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were on our porch, listening to rain drum on the tin roof while sharing cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain, flooding the plants around the porch. My father gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed both introspective and reminiscent. Over recent months, he had grown thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair thinning more than I recalled. He continued staring into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated and scared, unable to express how much I'd miss him, fearing that acknowledging it would make it more real. I hugged him, then sat closer, joining him in watching the June twilight rain.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The treatments had not alleviated his pain but had extended his life a few months beyond doctors' predictions. I couldn't determine the value in prolonging his suffering. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone at night, I offered no prayers, convinced that if God existed, He had long stopped listening to me.\n\nI hadn't wanted to witness his transition from this life to another, so I didn't. I couldn't bear to watch the end of the life that brought me into this world. I chose to remember my father by his life, not his death. I understood him more than others, even his family, and knew he wouldn't want me, his only child, to witness his passing. I isolated myself in my room for three days, awaiting the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an influential early advocate for Republicanism. Primarily an agriculturalist, his career in farming, coupled with a brief stint in politics, shaped his reputation for being vocal and committed to issues of personal liberty and governance. His belief in an agrarian society was central to his views on government. Taylor's efforts to preserve and promote what he deemed the most noble profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to build an exemplary system, unencumbered by native traditions that might restrict the formation of self-governance. He was a fervent supporter of the natural rights of man, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one undermines them all, diminishing their collective value. Therefore, these rights should be beyond governmental reach. He argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and cunning, but that this should not be the case within a civilized society.\n\nTo establish this ideal society, Taylor argued that government must recognize both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He was steadfast in his belief in a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He identified good principles as those safeguarding private property, enhancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. Taylor believed that a government founded on sound principles would function justly, despite being led by individuals driven by greed and self-interest. He saw self-interest as humanity's motivating force, deeming it harmful only when it led to the formation of sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others. A sound government was essential to curb man's natural flaws, requiring vigilant monitoring to prevent the introduction of detrimental principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He supported a highly limited Federal government, restricted to powers explicitly granted by the Constitution. Aware that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially tyrannical, he also recognized the dangers of a simplistic, literal interpretation, which could become corrupt without considering the framers' intentions. Furthermore, Taylor viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind processing the scene in front of me without any particular emotion or connection. With a detached focus, I observed what lay before me, allowing thoughts to drift in and out of my consciousness almost as quickly as they appeared. It felt as though my mind was engaged in a fluid experience, absorbing the visuals without forming distinct, personal thoughts.\n\nInspired by an artist I once collaborated with, I invested in an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Ever since childhood, I had harbored a desire to draw, and this book offered insights ranging from the basics of using a pencil to the cognitive processes involved in interpreting lines. One of its techniques involved framing a picture with a square to simplify complex scenes, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen adjoining a dining room, into a more manageable image.\n\nIn that moment, as I looked down at the bowl before me, I found myself unable to apply that artistic frame mentally. Overwhelmed by the sight, I stood there in amazement. Just as Picasso explored his blue period and Monet had a penchant for greenery, I faced the origins of my own artistic journey, which I whimsically dubbed Work in Brown.\n\nWith my fingertips on the chosen tool, I felt muscles tense and relax as my hand moved purposefully, driven by creative intent.

            "Young drivers face a significant risk on the roads, with multiple elements contributing to the high accident rates among teenagers in America. According to the National Institutes of Health, a major issue is that the adolescent brain is not fully developed to deal with the complexities of driving. In addition to this, the lack of driving experience among teens leads to more fatal accidents, an increased likelihood of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road.  \n\nMoreover, teenagers are particularly vulnerable when they drive with friends—a common scenario. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. In response, California and other states have implemented temporary provisional licenses, which limit the hours teens can drive and restrict them from carrying other minors as passengers. \n\nHowever, I view these provisional licenses as temporary fixes. The core problem lies in the fact that, statistically, the youngest drivers are not equipped to manage the responsibilities and dangers of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 is too young for a standard driver’s license. According to USA Today, Zuckerman's research indicates that individuals under 19-20 years old often engage in risky behavior for excitement. It seems prudent to delay driving until this risk-taking behavior diminishes. If young teens continue to be licensed, we will see a rise in fatal accidents, with potentially alarming consequences in the coming years. By 2010, many children of the Baby Boomer generation will reach driving age, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.  \n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should drive. A provisional permit could still precede a full license, with a requisite number of driving hours, similar to current state requirements—such as California’s mandate of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given that teen driving statistics are concerning nationwide, a uniform national law could effectively safeguard teenagers across the country. The legislative solution I propose is not an unprecedented concept.",
            "This essay addresses three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the disorder is given. Then, the process of diagnosis is discussed, highlighting typical signs or \"red flags.\" The essay concludes by suggesting ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how well the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. It specifically refers to the perceptual handling of auditory data in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing, generating electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally and are not classified as \"hearing impaired\"; the challenge lies in the brain’s ability to interpret sounds, such as distinguishing words or filtering conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers were studying children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing evaluations for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and created a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further encouraged research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various forms: affected individuals might struggle to pinpoint or hear sounds in space, have trouble distinguishing between multiple \"acoustic events,\" fail to recognize sound patterns, or find it difficult to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm. Sounds might be masked by subsequent noises, they may lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information, and they may not accurately perceive the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves screening the patient through \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" performed by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others using diverse measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process may include questionnaires, observational assessments of auditory responses, and interactions with specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, consistently effective diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder. Many tests present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking patients to differentiate among items like words or numbers. Advanced evaluations involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the corresponding responses.",
            "I am committed to studying social work with the aim of building a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I hope to assist children facing abuse or neglect and lend support to families in distress. The values I bring to this field include service, respect, ethics, a dedication to fostering better relationships, and a personal commitment to ongoing professional development to ensure competence. These principles hold great significance not only within social work but also resonate deeply with me on a personal level.\n\nFrom a young age, I've felt a strong desire to help others, though I wasn't always sure which career would allow me to do so. During my time in high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their problems or resorting to ineffective coping strategies. These observations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Despite this, I remained uncertain about my career direction after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, so I took some time off. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained his situation: he was seeking refuge from abusive parents. The next day, he called the police to his home. Wanting to help, I went to his parents' house and shared my concerns with the police, mentioning my recent degree in Psychology. Since legal action wasn't an option, the police asked me to speak with the parents. They seemed anxious and provided excuses, labeling their son’s actions to involve outsiders as “manipulative” responses to minor family conflicts. This encounter pushed me to seriously consider a career in social work, focusing on helping children navigate family issues.\n\nSocial justice is another core value essential to social work. Society often emphasizes the importance of the individual and laments those who are lost, yet the societal notion of individuality often clings to outdated traditions rather than embracing true uniqueness. If society grieves for lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I value my individuality and resist conforming to societal norms. During my high school and college years, I stood against social injustice in various ways: expressing myself through unique hair colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, getting non-traditional ear piercings, joining the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and actively opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. Upholding social justice is a belief I am passionate about, and I remain committed to challenging social injustice.",
            "This essay explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks as they pertain to insomnia, a sleep disorder. The biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. In contrast, the Sociocultural perspective examines how environmental interactions relate to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. This analysis of insomnia delves into these models, discussing selected research that helps clarify and expand upon each framework. The research findings are then assessed to highlight their individual strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to other mental disorders, or those associated with other factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those linked to other mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional sleep disorder categories may stem from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in falling or staying asleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by trouble staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy features symptoms like cataplexy and automatic REM. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are linked to behavioral or physiological irregularities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders associated with other mental disorders involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This review emphasizes insomnia and, to some extent, primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological perspective on sleep disorders considers genetic, hereditary, and physiological elements. Neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wake states. A study involving mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are specifically involved in sleep/wake regulation. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers sleep-promoting responses, and its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and enhanced sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was found to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that results from animal models can be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Issues or lack of this receptor could affect one's ability to sleep adequately without medication. The sociocultural implication is that if this phenotype is inherited, receptor changes could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep, adversely affecting areas like education, career, and routine activities requiring sustained attention.",
            "I've been attending University Park for roughly two and a half years, which equates to about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, which is nearly at the eastern edge of campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building near the campus center could take up to 25 minutes, particularly when the weather was unfavorable, which is a frequent occurrence in State College. An alum who graduated not long before I did mentioned that East Halls dorms were once isolated by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space has been transformed into sports fields and large new buildings, such as the Creamery and a new health services facility, with apartments surrounding them. As campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What is the best solution for campus mobility? The answer lies in using bicycles. However, simply having bikes isn’t enough. Students need to utilize them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nA friend of mine, who recently started cycling again after a break of several years, shared his thoughts. He questioned why he ever gave it up. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he remarked, \"although it wasn't trendy to ride one for a while, it's really the best way to get around.\" Besides being healthy, cycling is the most efficient travel method. With a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many students, I currently live off-campus, which is as far from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bicycle has been my smartest choice this year. Each day, I have a class in the Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my place. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I ride swiftly. The only challenge is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it can be a difficult road to navigate, whether on bike or on foot. While there are benefits to walking, my schedule is too packed to allow for it. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to reach class. Walking to Thomas daily would consume an extra 30-40 minutes of my time. That adds up to over two and a half hours weekly. Plus, there’s the additional time I'd spend walking to and from other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a dystopian future where technology and capitalism pose significant threats. The society depicted prioritizes the community over the individual, with citizens trained from birth to seek immediate happiness. People in this world are mere players in a grander scheme, bound by a single ideology established by the World Controller. Through a Marxist perspective, one can see Huxley's skepticism about the evolving economic systems of his era. Terms frequently used in Marxist theory, such as hegemony and reification, underscore the idea that Huxley's novel critiques emerging economic systems from his time.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary people are unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, as they focus on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control over the proletariat and common workers, which is evident in the conditioning witnessed in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack true autonomy; through hypnopædia, their desire to consume and spend is prioritized above all. This is controlled by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that social classes are completely dominated by a separate group, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to their manipulation, quite literally buying into an ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes are aware but largely passive, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between social classes highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, meaningful relationships between individuals are absent. Major characters lack depth, suggesting that technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial. This is illustrated by men's comments about women focusing on their physical traits and women's open discussions about their encounters. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class with their hierarchical status reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their complete obedience to their societal roles aligns with Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC. A central topic of lively debate in the class was the question of whether Islam is a hostile religion. I find this question increasingly pertinent today. Reflecting on the events following 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the mass media's portrayal of Islam and extremists—from a hostile perspective to a more tolerant stance in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Borac Obama, hinting at a Muslim heritage, could have emerged.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me because it seems to contradict Muhammad's historical persona as I understood it. Previously, I was under the impression that Muhammad coerced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, who humbly engaged with others, leading people to recognize the 'truth' of his teachings and seek him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. A notable example is the episode where Muhammad supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to satisfy forty men. This narrative style suggests the writers sought to present Muhammad as a humble prophet, whose life was defined by truth and miracles, rather than needing validation. I find this portrayal problematic as it seems to undermine Jesus Christ's life and miracles, almost as if credit is being shifted from Jesus to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous anecdotes that appear to aim at demonstrating 'witness' or independent conversions to Islam. However, many of these stories are relayed from third-party perspectives, like a chain of hearsay. While intended to substantiate the authenticity of these accounts, I feel it instead casts doubt and makes the stories appear more questionable.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble leader. I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The original teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his life quickly became overshadowed as Christian thought evolved after his time. Observing this history broadly reveals a pattern of Christianity drifting further from its roots. In today's world, we see an increasing awareness and an unprecedented push towards progressive thinking. While traditionalists persist and resist new ideas beyond their familiar teachings, they may not hold enough sway to shape the entire population. Among Christians, historical consciousness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to separate doctrines that were later added to Christianity from the original intentions of its founder. This process might take decades or even centuries, but it is seen as unavoidable: a significant shift in Christian history will occur, steering it back toward its foundational form. A movement will gain momentum, peeling away layers of added doctrine as if time were reversing, until what remains is the essence of what Jesus shared with humanity, before others claimed similar revelations. As this movement spreads across the United States and Europe, drawing people to worship as though they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will continue to guide the process. However, with this regression of theological development, the vast diversity within Christianity will gradually diminish, leading to more uniformity in beliefs and practices. Instead of highlighting differences across regions, denominations, and various divisions, growing similarities will emerge. Human history includes many examples of significant reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, which later embraced Christianity. Our nation has shifted from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming major reversion will unfold within the Christian religion, seeking its origins and reducing its diversity. This transformation will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what transpired since Jesus' lifetime? Looking back, we see Judaism as the theological foundation of Christianity. By the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. However, the Jewish population was not unified; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" illustrates the inherent tendency of humans to be greedy and self-serving. People are primarily concerned with improving their own circumstances without considering those less fortunate. This theme is exemplified throughout \"The Jungle,\" particularly in the portrayal of factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding and enhancing their enterprises, showing little to no concern for the consequences of their actions on others. Upton Sinclair's narrative conveys this indifference vividly: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair emphasizes the environmental devastation caused by pollution, highlighting the disregard owners have for the welfare of people and animals affected by it. They ignore the harmful smoke emissions and the animal waste runoff from the numerous pens in Packingtown.\n\nThe disregard extends to their workforce, whom they exploit to amass wealth. Their priority is maximizing profits, as depicted by Sinclair's observation: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure grueling hours only to be abruptly laid off, often without notice or severance. During the period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" labor laws safeguarding workers' rights were scarce, allowing management to impose harsh working conditions. Although the narrative does not explicitly state it, the residents of Packingtown were expected to endure these dire circumstances at work and in their communities. There were no supportive agencies or resources for laborers. Unions existed but frequently exploited workers, profiting from their plight. The workers, trapped in a system akin to slavery, had no escape: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finer poetic works. Within this poem, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in both lines 6 and 56, a reference that Mabbott links back to Virgil. In classical literature, Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island situated to the north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, there exists a more contemporary source that deserves acknowledgment. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, which is significant in understanding his influences.\n\nThe importance of this reference lies in demonstrating Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his work \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes parallels between their poems, suggesting that Poe was drawing inspiration from Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature highlights Goethe as a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, with the first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who becomes despondent after his wife's passing, leading to heavy drinking and sorrow. Eventually, the king decides to die, bequeathing his possessions to his children except for a goblet, which he throws into the sea before closing his eyes and dying. The portrayal of the King of Thulé bears a striking resemblance to the king in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe’s own experiences with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's writings contain two references to Thule. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses this phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" effectively framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes a Thule landscape as dark, desolate, haunted by departed friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his desire to govern or live. The entirety of \"Dream-Land\" reads as if the narrator has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a pivotal literary figure Poe would have been acquainted with, if only due to his respect for Tennyson. Poe expressed his admiration for Tennyson, which suggests an exposure to Goethe’s works through the numerous versions produced following the original publication.",
            "In the context of California law, can a customer injured by slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be granted punitive damages if it's shown that the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill and neglecting to address it for half an hour while having dinner? \n\nIt's unlikely that a judge will outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify such an award, the plaintiff needs to demonstrate that the defendant's behavior was willfully and consciously indifferent to the likely harm it would cause, alongside proving the conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have foreseen the potential harm from ignoring a spill, given that multiple customers at D&D had suffered injuries from slipping incidents in the months leading up to her accident. Despite this awareness, he failed to address the spill. Although the argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains plausible considering that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, yet Martin did not take adequate steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn the evening of October 13, 2009, at 5:00 p.m., Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin at 5:15 p.m., receiving the same response. By 5:30 p.m., Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Before Palmer's fall, five slip-and-fall incidents had already been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and the decision at hand is whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages for breaching a non-contractual obligation if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice” as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The law defines malice as behavior intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, behavior that is “despicable” and executed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff’s rights, particularly when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From a young age, she felt like something crucial was missing in her life. This yearning was persistent and unfulfilled, beginning around the age of 14 when she was navigating the early stages of adolescence. Even by 17, the feeling lingered. Over time, she realized it was not a thing she sought but a connection with someone. However, no boys caught her interest, despite several attempting to win her over in their awkward ways. She often pondered this peculiar situation, trying to understand why a teenage girl like herself felt this way. Years of reflection provided various theories, yet none seemed convincing enough. Thus, she continued her journey, always questioning her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents were peaceful individuals, rarely arguing with each other or with her, except when it came to her asserting her independence. She was the lively counterpart to her calm parents, her vibrant and engaging personality making her well-liked.\n\nYet today was far from calm. As she moved through the house, searching for fresh inspiration, a sudden scream from the kitchen pierced the air, her mother's voice. Panic set in as she rushed to the kitchen, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing in pain and repeating \"Ow\" with labored breaths. Instinctively, she rushed to help, placing a hand on her mother. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" her mother managed to say, her voice strained. Recognizing her mother's distress, she asked where to lift her, grateful for her strength-training classes. Gently, she carried her mother to the car, settled her in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the sterile scent of disinfectant and an undercurrent of anxiety. But she was too focused on her mother to notice. Swiftly, she carried her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Medical staff quickly surrounded them, placing her mother on a gurney and whisking her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to wait and worry.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a stepping stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf of their cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this research was to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and death from stroke. The aMed diet is a variation of the traditional Med diet, emphasizing greater intake of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (as opposed to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nEarlier prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of total mortality and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, with one intervention trial indicating that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals with obesity. However, previous studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times based on self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year duration. Validation studies were conducted on the FFQs. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through the review of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were labeled \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified this way. Factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was evaluated.\n\nTo minimize random variations for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from the previous two years. Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could introduce bias in results) by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was correlated with a decreased risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20 years of follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "A sign claims Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, stands by herself at a street corner, holding a piece of cardboard above her head with the startling message scrawled on it in Sharpie. Burma, which is also called Myanmar, is located in Southeast Asia and has been under the control of a harsh military junta since they seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country experienced its first significant public protests in a decade, spearheaded by a large group of Burmese monks. These demonstrations became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the general public began to support the movement, and the government reluctantly permitted peaceful gatherings. However, the situation escalated into severe violence, with the military openly attacking and looting monasteries. Foreign journalists were detained, and Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photojournalist, was killed during a protest on September 27, 2007. While official reports state 13 fatalities, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army shortly before the official report, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nThese events are not isolated in history. The suppression of dissent by governments to maintain control has been a recurring theme throughout civilization. Roman emperors once declared divine authority over their societies. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, leading their people toward technological and cultural advancements. Meanwhile, in modern times, George W. Bush, the U.S. president at the time, held weekly discussions with Ted Haggard, leader of the group Stupid People Worldwide, an offshoot of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable historical parallels include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to oppose government authoritarianism. The death toll from that event varies, with Chinese government figures citing 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Additionally, the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militias, with government support, systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s 'Third Reich,' during which Jewish individuals were systematically exterminated across several countries, stands as another extreme example.",
            "Duke Ellington's influence on jazz can be largely attributed to his enduring career and his remarkable talent in shaping his orchestra. While Ellington's piano presence may be subtle in many of the pieces chosen for this assignment, his brilliance as a composer lies in his ability to craft intricate compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. He designed frameworks that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while also composing tightly orchestrated sections that drew on the distinctive styles of his musicians to emphasize musical concepts. This approach allowed him to focus on the overall tone of the orchestra, generating cohesive and innovative sounds for each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of each musician's sound and their role within the ensemble enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and ingenious works in the history of jazz.\n\nIn discussing Ellington's innovative sound, the Grove Music dictionary highlights \"Creole Love Call,\" an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" without the limitations of lyrics. This piece illustrates Ellington's skill in enhancing the style of his soloists, a quality evident throughout his career. The piece is a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition with six choruses:\n\n1. A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that becomes rougher towards the end.\n2. A muted trumpet solo that expands on the basic melody, emphasizing extended blue notes.\n3. A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n4. The full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\n5. The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the original structure with a call and response between voice and reeds, featuring the voice utilizing the \"growl\" technique as an instrument.\n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending. Ellington's use of voice to add tonal color to this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait prevalent in his work.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his expertise in orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color. A call and response sequence between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing merges the vocal quality of Miley's trumpet and the instrumental quality of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementing sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a cornerstone of Ellington’s orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone with great effect.",
            "What drives the evolutionary patterns we observe in living organisms? Are there particular limitations or factors that shape how these changes occur over time? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that defining even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms was a task barely begun by zoologists, and this challenge remains today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been utilized to study the general process of mollusk shell formation across both individual development and evolutionary history, as demonstrated in works like those by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research is investigating the use of mathematical modeling on the developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum species. By integrating these models with experimental studies, we aim to uncover the mechanisms that guide the extent and direction of evolutionary changes. We employed X-ray images of Prunum species to extract quantitative parameters, which were then used to simulate both potential and actual shell structures. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software program developed by Stone in 1995. Our models of hypothetical shell forms help us understand the limits of morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being combined with experimental and descriptive research to enhance our comprehension of large-scale evolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that progresses through time, completing rotations in 360-degree space. The rotations of a coiled shell are termed whorls, spiraling around an imagined central axis, known as the columella, which runs through the core of the shell. The rate at which whorls expand differs, and a continuous line called a suture delineates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, referred to as the body whorl. All preceding whorls form the spire. The spire's tip is the apex, while the base is found at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Traditionally, the apertural view is most common, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex directed upwards.\n\nA technique for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apex and identifying the start of the first suture. A line is drawn to split the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to the nearest quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a succession of apertures moving through time and space as the organism builds its shell. One can trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center and the horizontal and vertical radii of each whorl's aperture.\n\nThis path can be depicted graphically and mathematically. With a mathematical model in place, it becomes feasible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little change. Despite progress toward achieving many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation improvements, the advancements in child and maternal health fall significantly short of the targets set for 2015. This analysis will explore the various causes of these deficiencies and emphasize the importance of reinforcing the health system over implementing isolated program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen progress in the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers, now at 72%. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who lack the ability to perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, which contributes to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage. Thus, the perceived progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, indicating much more work is needed. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving professional health treatment. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is another area of concern, with low coverage nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still below expected levels, around 4%, highlighting another issue. While urban areas have a 7% c-section rate, rural areas are at just 2%, indicating a disparity in healthcare coverage. Access to healthcare is concentrated in urban regions. Moreover, there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest, showing that socioeconomic status significantly impacts healthcare access, likely because of out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering future strategies to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the primary question is how best to address service deficiencies. Should Indonesia focus on specific programmatic approaches or enhance the overall health system without targeting pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children? Programmatic solutions are appealing due to their defined objectives and typically faster results. However, they have drawbacks, such as diverting resources from other health areas and concentrating human resources in more funded sectors, like the effect of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning. Additionally, running multiple separate programs for a single area can lead to redundant services and lack of coordination, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the classification of Popular Music has expanded to such an extent that it encompasses an overwhelming number of genres, making it challenging to catalog them all comprehensively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and further sub-categories within their realms. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most varied and expressive branches of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness is evident in its portrayal of a broad spectrum of emotions, often skewing toward the darker hues. Diversity in Heavy Metal emerged rapidly as people recognized its adaptability, leading them to innovate their own sub-genres, which then evolved into sub-sub-genres, continuing this trend to the present day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has fragmented into so many distinct niches that defining what constitutes heavy metal has become increasingly challenging. It has absorbed a multitude of influences from other genres, yet like all musical forms, it originated from a specific point. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends being merely a genre.\n\nIn several respects, metal is a movement characterized by its embrace of darkness. It can be described as music that embodies \"more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatrical elements. It shuns simplicity and highlights technical skill; musicians in metal bands are typically adept with their instruments, which is evident in their performances. Additionally, it may not come as a shock that metal is a movement significantly influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly wild and surreal records, with drugs often serving as a catalyst for such creativity. Metal music carries many dark, visceral attributes, which were relatively novel in the music scene, as much of popular music had previously avoided delving into the darker emotional territories. Furthermore, later iterations of metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent during the Romantic Era. The following lyrics exemplify the darkness integral to the movement:\n\nThese lines from \"Helter Skelter\" reveal the Beatles' darker side, reflecting a tumultuous journey, often attributed to drug influence. This song is regarded by some as one of the pioneering Heavy Metal tracks. It was crafted in response to a Rolling Stones song that also explored heavier, darker themes. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their capability to match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include the song on \"The White Album.\"",
            "Several decades prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists and their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was ingeniously sculpting his own dreams, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. \"The Dream,\" a painting completed in 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist, not only illustrates a woman marveling at the wonders of a dreamland but also symbolizes Rousseau's personal ambitions and aspirations as an artist. From the onset of his career, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet he encountered a significant internal conflict in his pursuit of these dreams. \"The Dream\" embodies Rousseau's lifelong internal battle: whether to adapt or emulate certain artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished, or to remain creatively autonomous and distinct, forging his own path. \n\nTo understand \"The Dream\" from this perspective, it is essential to be acquainted with Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwestern France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class life (Shattuck 47). He had no formal artistic education; instead, he worked for the French government as a gabelou, a municipal toll employee, until he was forty years old, acquiring the misleading nickname douanier, meaning customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The passing of his first wife, Clémence, following the deaths of eight infant children, left him with only one surviving child, a daughter named Julia, and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and renewal, he turned to painting as a refuge. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized the peasantry in their art, Rousseau was fundamentally a folk artist with the hopes and aspirations typical of his social class.\n\nRousseau's fixation on gaining acceptance in the art community is understandable when considered in context: not only did he lack formal training and begin his artistic journey later in life, but he was also creating art alongside many other skilled and renowned modern artists. Despite years of effort, Rousseau did not receive significant recognition until around the same time that Matisse was establishing his own artistic reputation. In \"Modern French Painters,\" Jan Gordon argues that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art: \"Matisse aimed to avoid painting in a clichéd manner, whereas Rousseau sought to create works so conventional that he would gain admission to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Various eminent thinkers have often drawn parallels between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a deep link between truth and beauty. I feel there is a foundational basis for this idea. In his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" John Keats famously states, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from formal education or personal experiences. Yet, our grasp of ethics and aesthetics seems, as Keats hints, to come naturally rather than through conventional teaching methods. Ethics and aesthetics are more about describing than prescribing. When we delve into morality and beauty, we're generally trying to understand why a particular artwork or piece of literature is considered beautiful, or why certain actions are deemed moral, instead of creating a rigid framework for evaluating art or ethical conduct.\n\nImportantly, critiques of art or morality often fall short of fully encapsulating what makes something good or beautiful. For instance, discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on elements like composition, contrast, or its cultural significance, but these do not entirely explain why it is revered as great art. Often, when someone is asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, they might start with, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed analysis. I think that neither art nor morals can be wholly broken down into descriptions of their characteristics. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we attempt to characterize a literary work, there remains an ineffable quality. Similarly, I believe ethics shares this feature. Wittgenstein expresses this by saying, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” This ineffable \"something,\" or je ne sais quoi, I propose, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality, and this transcendental quality is what links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI think the closeness between morality and art stems from our profound experience of both on a level that is intuitive, to borrow from Kant's terminology. They affect us in a way that is felt deeply but not easily articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in the literary arts. As McKean points out, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a robust and united nation, showcasing a diverse cultural heritage stretching from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This cultural tapestry extends from Cologne on the Rhine through Germany's heartland to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given this rich cultural amalgamation, it's no wonder that contemporary Germany has roots in numerous sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans, Germania, is steeped in mystery regarding the origin of its name, a topic of much debate among historians and scholars. Tacitus suggested the name originated from a Germanic tribe once known as the Tungrians, who had been referred to as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first documented the term “Germanus” in his account of the Gallic Wars, distinguishing between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes, who frequently crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls themselves to differentiate the unconquered tribes. Some theories suggest the name signified a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar remarked: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Other interpretations link the name to the spear, or \"ger,\" used in warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly to the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning “to shout,” hinting at the Germans’ loud or boisterous nature (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, an early Roman historian, penned \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" in AD 98, exploring the origins of the Germans. He asserted that the Germans were likely indigenous, not intermingled with other races through immigration or contact. He wrote: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nAs for departing Rome for Germania, the Romans seldom did so. Instead, they ventured into Germania for trade and occasional military campaigns, yet typically returned to their expansive empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they inhabited the Roman Empire's frontiers, exchanging land-derived goods and military service within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the play explores the notion that while disguises can be effective tools for deception over long periods, ultimately, one must discard these façades to avoid losing their true self. However, ceasing such deception can lead to feelings of alienation. Thus, an individual must choose between preserving their own identity and maintaining relationships with others. Some may react indifferently upon learning they were deceived, but others might not be as forgiving, feeling insulted by the entire ruse.\n\nThe issue of deception becomes particularly complex when it involves gender role reversal, raising significant questions, particularly: why? What drives a person to abandon their identity and adopt a disguise as the opposite gender? For Viola, it serves as a means of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249).\n\nViola, arriving in an unfamiliar place, chooses to disguise herself as a man to shield herself from potential threats. Although her plan is successful, it distances her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support network. Complicating matters further, she is so adept at her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary audiences, Twelfth Night might appear to illustrate how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. The text suggests that these characters might have latent desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario merely because he seems to be a man, or does she have unspoken feelings for women? It seems unlikely, as Shakespeare’s portrayal of Olivia appears to satirize individuals of his era who judge others based solely on appearance.\n\nThis is further demonstrated by how easily Olivia transfers her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, subsequently viewing Cesario/Viola as part of her family rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "The harshness of German colonial rule has been highlighted by numerous commentators, particularly regarding the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. Nonetheless, it would be an oversimplification to characterize an entire colonial empire with a single description. The German colonial empire exhibited a wide range of policies and governance styles, reflecting its diverse geography. Educational opportunities varied significantly across the colonies as well. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British discovered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories received acclaim from writers of that era.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government took an active role in establishing state schools for the education of the indigenous population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies, which operated with minimal government assistance. The government, however, allocated considerable resources towards European education in the colony, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies had enduring impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond the period of German colonial rule. While in other German colonies, there was a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a focus on recent research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere exists a considerable body of literature concerning education within the German colonial empire. Most of these early 20th-century sources, written during or shortly after the German colonial period, are in German. The primary objective of these early works was to describe the educational systems within these colonies. Subsequent writings in English broadened the discussion by conducting comparative studies of education across the different German colonies and providing more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work explicitly addressing the subject of this paper is Cohen’s analysis of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen examines the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors accounting for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining the unique characteristics of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively temperate climate, although much of the area consisted of arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected the relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide a historical example of two countries once embroiled in a prolonged rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The pinnacle of this conflict was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, during which the United States emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other skirmishes occurred between the nations, gradually decreasing in intensity until just before World War I. This rivalry was fueled by fundamental disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31).\n\nThis situation mirrors many other instances where neighboring nations maintain longstanding rivalries. Countries that share borders often experience conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico, in this regard, are similar to other enduring rivalries between bordering nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American countries that have generally maintained favorable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences significantly contributed to the discord between the United States and Mexico, a challenge not unlike those faced by numerous nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that while Americans opposed fascism and communism in the twentieth century, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they opposed Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). Similar to the ideological and interest-based rivalry of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, the conflict here was rooted in religious differences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, with both nations inheriting these sentiments from their colonial pasts, complicating the establishment of friendly relations between the two.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year period of rivalry, most of which involved territorial issues related to border raids and frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a significant issue until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). According to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually concluded when American interests shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "A decade and a half ago, I found myself confronting a sudden and unforeseen disability caused by an illness I had never heard of before.\n\nAt the time, I worked as a nurse. My decision to enter this profession was rooted in a deep-seated desire for the security and stability that were absent during my childhood. Growing up, I frequently heard the reassurance, \"You'll always find work; people will always need care.\" Despite aspiring to become a scientist or journalist—or perhaps a blend of both—I opted for nursing due to its perceived reliability.\n\nFast forward to the present, I am 46, single, with no savings to fall back on, and unable to continue working. Even now, after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I possess very little that I can truly call my own. I manage to get by, but each day presents a challenge to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. While many aspects of my life remain uncertain, one truth stands out: I would not have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. No matter how resilient you think you are, true crises can make you feel incredibly vulnerable.\n\nThe reality is that life will always present us with both major and minor emergencies. There are no absolute assurances, and regardless of how well-prepared one is, some obstacles are simply too large to handle alone.\n\nI strongly believe that in the U.S., we need to shift away from solely relying on government intervention, which, frankly, is showing signs of deterioration. Instead, I advocate for a revival of trust among Americans—encouraging us to help one another and not hesitate to seek assistance, rather than isolating ourselves to build metaphorical fortresses.\n\nWhile U.S. Conservatives often emphasize \"rugged individualism\" as the backbone of our nation, in reality, it was the empathy, mutual respect, and resource sharing that sustained our ancestors during tough times. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains reached the coast through collective effort, not solitary endeavors.\n\nTherefore, by all means, take precautions. I have done so myself, assembling a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. I have stockpiled flashlights, a variety of batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and means to cultivate a small farm and preserve your own food, it is a wise investment. Consider also a wood stove, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you prepare, take the time to connect with those around you.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he gave up worldly attachments and attained enlightenment, leading to the emergence of Buddhism. The most traditional school of Buddhism is Theravada Buddhism. This religion has a history spanning around 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople partake in this event, which holds religious significance, even though Buddha never advocated such festivities. These variations extend from surface-level traditions to the core principles of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its doctrinal beliefs due to various influences, both from within and outside the religion, whether supportive or antagonistic.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use specific terms. Internal forces refer to influences originating from within the Buddhasasana, regardless of one's monastic status. External forces are those from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm Buddhism, stemming from negative perceptions. Benign forces are neutral, not aiming to harm or help, though they might inadvertently do one or the other. These concepts will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nTo begin, examining the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism is essential. Buddhists seek solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma primarily includes the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka details disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka addresses Buddhism's metaphysical aspects. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life's inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is necessary to break free from Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. Enlightenment brings an end to Sansara along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines life rules: laypeople follow five precepts (abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants), while monks adhere to more extensive regulations. The central doctrinal element in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, Dukkha, the truth of suffering in life; second, the attachment that causes suffering; and third, the possibility of overcoming suffering."
