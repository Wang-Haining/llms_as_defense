            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In negotiations, the influence of culture is profound and multifaceted. Defining culture extends beyond its visible aspects to what it signifies and what it is not. It is not a monolith or a singular entity, nor does it conform to uniformity. Oversimplified statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are generalizations that can be misleading. While recognizing cultural stereotypes can be useful, it is far more beneficial for negotiators to grasp how a culture impacts the negotiation process and what implications it may hold. When encountering a different culture, one naturally perceives it through the lens of their own, prompting comparisons.\n\nGaining insight into a foreign culture or mindset might require exploring its history or understanding its biases. Instead of judging or attempting to alter a culture, it is crucial to accept it as it is and operate within its limits, particularly during negotiations, especially when one's negotiating position is weaker. Similarly, when a negotiator is on unfamiliar ground, respecting traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural obstacles and advance the negotiations.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that culture transcends national or international boundaries. Many companies within a nation cultivate their own unique corporate cultures. For example, a business might prioritize lengthy office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture is evident in aspects such as employee dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), and delegation of tasks. Some companies promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others restrict it to company-sanctioned charities or events. Observing variations in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within the same company across different regions, from urban to suburban) highlights the diversity of perspectives within a societal culture. While some cultures might seem less stratified than American culture, appearing more homogeneous, this similarity merely prompts deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is crucial as they explain the rationale behind a culture's behaviors. For instance, in cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that emphasize hard bargaining may not rush to settle an agreement. Considering these general cultural tendencies is essential before entering negotiations. However, a negotiator benefits from learning about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This view is similarly shared by another thinker we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas. As both philosophers defend the same idea, our task is to determine which argument is more compelling. For the sake of brevity, let's assume they both correctly believe in the existence of the biblical God. Introducing a different concept of a deity would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as they defend a specific notion of God. Despite the strengths in their arguments, neither offers a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo delve into this issue, let's first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes finding understanding through faith, suggesting that evidence of God can be discovered within oneself. He claims that since God is present within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Although Anselm's ideas can be complex and occasionally unclear, his main point is that the proof of God resides in our minds. He implies that we don't need external evidence to recognize the truth of God's existence, as it is something we inherently know. This concept of believing without conclusive empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas holds a different perspective. Aquinas argues that God's existence can be demonstrated purely through reason and empirical evidence, requiring no faith. This approach could aid evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by attracting new converts without relying on their acceptance of the unprovable. Instead, they could be convinced through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: motion, causation, contingency, gradation, and design. Through these, he asserts that the logical necessity for God serves as proof of His existence. Just as one could infer the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic can reveal God's existence.",
            "Authors often employ various strategies to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers concerning significant themes. While some methods prove more effective than others, F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully incorporates a range of these techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives with nouns in unconventional pairings to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to objects and employs them for a similar purpose. A notable example of this latter technique is his use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, with meaning, which he later utilizes to evoke a particular emotional response in relation to an important object.\n\nThe symbolism attached to white/gray is one of uniformity, with white suggesting a more refined and upper-class quality, whereas gray conveys an aged and faded impression. This symbolism is established early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8)—in fact, white clothing appears prevalent: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Interestingly, the only moment white is absent is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, noting that \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further cements the meanings of these colors by associating them with mundane, common subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby’s party attendees appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's list, and Catherine’s apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). Additionally, ordinary people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sufficiently established the meanings of white/gray, he uses these colors to represent insignificance or conformity in various subjects. This technique is notably applied to Daisy. After a period without significant mention of these colors, Daisy is suddenly depicted \"dressed in white\" and driving \"a little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more as a component of uniformity, an object of Gatsby's desire (74). Fitzgerald continues to employ this technique to reinforce the idea of Daisy as a uniform presence, as seen in descriptions like the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

Many organic farms extend invitations for tours, offering insights into their farming operations, and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. Such ventures enable landowners to leverage government programs' advantages while enhancing habitat, thus facilitating recreational use and creating prospects for farm tours and educational programs.  \n  \nEngaging in organic farming not only caters to a potentially profitable niche market but also often results in enhanced biodiversity of local flora and fauna, owing to the absence of chemical use in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be costlier than traditional farming methods. It necessitates more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also miss out on the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Practices that, while not directly linked to organic farming, benefit wildlife may also incur additional labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to cultivate specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Therefore, there are several reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profits and habitat quality.  \n  \nThe chosen land for this scenario is located near the town of Potrero, in the unincorporated area of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres, consisting of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. Situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the plan is under review and currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are in decline and may soon be listed, like the burrowing owls.  \n  \nThis area has a rich history, having been home to Native Americans for countless generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The parcel of land was originally part of a homestead patent and likely utilized for grazing or wood production over the decades. I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and explored available government programs to assess what options a small farmer might have to mitigate costs and maintain wildlife-friendly operations. As a model for what someone farming this land might aim to accomplish, I identified an organic farm within the same vicinity.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, a lasting, unalterable bond. This connection encompasses a range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, more than anyone else connected by such a bond, seeing themselves in their sibling. In moments of crisis, this bond reveals its true nature, whether for better or worse. As these emotions surface, they come with significant consequences. Part of grasping the emotions stemming from this fraternal link involves navigating the outcomes they entail. When one gazes into a brother’s eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the tumultuous emotions it brings. Set against a richly detailed backdrop, these boys embark on a doomed journey. The story reaches a climax where bitter disappointment and intense pride collide, leaving only one brother alive. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, alongside the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview, both heavily influencing his behavior.  \nThe protagonist’s behavior is largely driven by a single emotion: pride. From the onset of their adventures to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother to whom he could impart his skills, such as \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He envisioned a companion to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. These dreams are thwarted by Doodle's frail condition. Born with a severely weak heart, Doodle's survival was uncertain, let alone his participation in strenuous activities. For the young protagonist, bursting with fanciful dreams, the reality was crushing. His frustration even led him to consider harming his brother by suffocating him with a pillow—a shocking thought for a child. Yet, a simple smile from Doodle softened his heart, offering the protagonist a glimmer of hope. This suggests that his resolve was not firm; deep down, he had an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has progressed from basic to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. In the beginning, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, later to a book, and now, to a computer. When studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory data repeatedly through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the object's borders—where color changes abruptly—to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses decisions made during bottom-up processing to enhance your recognition of the box. In this case, top-down processing might help you recognize the object as a black box rather than a hole shaped like a box in the white background.\n\nAfter information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter evaluates the importance of the signal and decides which cognitive processes it should be directed to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might notice your name even in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, and the outcomes are repeatedly influenced by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for each sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some arising from how people retrieve memories, others from computer science or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial downturn. This period saw rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and significant damage to some of America’s key corporations. The recession continues to affect us today, prompting a critical question: what caused this crisis, and what measures can prevent a recurrence? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from reckless and shortsighted political choices that compelled banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. Institutions like Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pushed to back and repackage these loans into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, spreading the turmoil through the repackaged loans and affecting the broader economy. \n\nThe origins of this financial predicament trace back to 1999 during President Clinton's administration, as he sought to bolster his re-election chances by increasing his popularity. The administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt the pressure from shareholders to sustain its impressive profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: “But the government-backed corporation could face trouble in an economic downturn, possibly necessitating a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.” As outlined earlier and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending practices led to the economic collapse.\n\nA confluence of factors sent the economy into a downward spiral, including the intricate structure of new mortgages. In the years preceding the crisis, adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used, linking more sectors of the economy to the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets overextending their investments in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered the consequences. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a collective $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing about 30% of the nation’s GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. It's that part of your narrative where you get to spread your creative wings and soar, dazzling everyone with your enchanting, almost magical writing. Or, it's the section where your readers lose interest and possibly exit your story, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin, for instance, is known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not a writer's ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the classic advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin often finds herself entangled in lengthy passages where either nothing occurs, or too much happens. Exposition is that pesky little voice that tells you to breeze through the backstory to reach the more exciting parts (distinct from the voice that urges you to relay every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about past events, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, this occurs when one character shares a wealth of information with another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, this responsibility falls on the author.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her love at a specific place and time, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to be compressed into two pages, with both characters only exchanging a couple of lines each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating through his dialogue and actions how profoundly he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to express, in both subtle and significant ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if it's later stated explicitly in the story). Properly introducing the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and provide insights into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, and hints about her thoughts and dreams as mirrored through his perspective. You would mourn his loss alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate more substance beyond the basic plotline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, furnishing that substance is your task. (*glances at the metaphor, sighs, continues*) It's often tempting to skim over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he's an ex-Air Force member, currently the night manager at a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys weekend fishing trips, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live segment on NBC 4 this morning, August 13, 2011. The leading story featured a man from Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't reveal her name, but they did show his mug shot, which gave off a menacing impression. The story was brief, lasting only about two minutes since it was still unfolding. The details shared were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody. I felt the time spent on this story was adequate.\n\nThe second report focused on an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, there were no arrests or suspects. The SWAT Team was conducting the investigation. This story seemed brief, and I suspect this might be because it involved a black man or occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. Over the years, I've noticed that crimes involving minorities as victims tend to receive less media attention. In contrast, if a white child or adult is abducted or harmed, the media coverage is extensive. However, if the victim is a minority, the incident is lucky to get even a mention.\n\nAnother story covered a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided on the suspected location of the incident. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle struck the helicopter, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the responsible individual.\n\nThe following report discussed the rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. The segment was relatively brief, likely used as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also included a story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. He was estimated to be about six feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on his race and complexion.\n\nAnother report detailed the case of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if this was meant to sound harsher or for another reason. They also noted that he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment security aimed at tracking indices, commodities, or collections of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits typical of index funds with the individual stock advantages such as short selling, margin buying, and the option to buy as little as one share at a time. These attributes are appealing, particularly since ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, investing in ETFs requires paying a commission for trades, similar to stock transactions. One major advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite the clear advantages, it's prudent for investors to critically assess if these benefits, like diversification, are genuinely present and to what extent. To explore this, we will analyze the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF yields similar benefits to a diversified portfolio of these stocks, and to evaluate if alternative configurations of the same stocks might offer a better Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo streamline the evaluation of the ETF, focusing on every holding would be cumbersome, so we will consider only the top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Listed below are these top 10 holdings along with their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks reflect the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current asset percentages, adjusted to 100%, to compute their contributions to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio comprised solely these 10 stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The Beta and return calculations are detailed in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it’s apparent that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It’s also noted that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically different.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and adjusted to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the third month of the project, as shown in Figure 17, there was a significant decline in the number of commuter log submissions, which was somewhat disappointing and difficult to fully understand. At a New England campus, winter leads to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, which could partially explain the decrease. December marks the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is occupied with completing assignments and finalizing grades. Logging commutes might have simply been overlooked during this period. Additionally, December is when the busy holiday season begins, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to be on campus. Classes start again in late January for the spring semester, which might also explain the low number of logs during that time. However, this does not account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that any project like this has an initial surge of enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counter this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March to boost engagement, which led to an increase in log submissions. Thus, maintaining momentum was a challenge, particularly due to the natural decline in interest and the impact of holiday and semester breaks in academia. \n\nAnother hurdle for this project, as with any initiative promoting alternative commuting, is the preference for the freedom and convenience associated with driving. This is a deeply rooted cultural norm. Therefore, providing incentives is crucial to encourage alternative commuting. We offered a variety of prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local bookstore, and some larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car, might have influenced participation. This could have also helped address the drop in engagement. The prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, if the value of the prizes had increased over time, it might have helped sustain interest. The gift cards were well-received at the project's start, but announcing the addition of a few bicycles in December, followed by a hybrid or electric car in January, might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all of the trick films, totaling fifteen between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis mainly centered on detailing the poetics of the majority of these trick films and investigating the unique features evident in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films at the century's turn are confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, employing long and medium shots, and adhering to a strict one shot equals one film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s venture beyond these boundaries by incorporating elements such as multiple shots. \n\nA prominent feature shared among trick films is their filming within an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, neither following figures nor objects. This static composition was prevalent in early films, rooted in theatrical traditions, and for trick films specifically, influenced by vaudeville and magic performances. A limitation of this stage-like setup is that characters typically move laterally, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the screen. Even as they exit the frame, the camera remains fixed.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also results in predominantly long shots and occasionally medium shots, with close-ups absent from Edison’s trick films. This reflects theatrical and vaudeville practices where audiences viewed the entire act within the stage's frame. Like most early films, actors do not advance from the middle ground towards the camera, hence the absence of close-ups.\n\nEarly trick films often adhere to the formula where one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This typically restricts the length of these films to about a minute or less, contingent on the frames per second. It also confines the narrative or dramatic scope of the trick films, which usually focus on brief vaudeville-like tricks—magic, vanishing, or switching acts—without much storyline. Importantly, in a trick film, a single conceptual shot perceived by the viewer does not necessarily equate to one physical shot. A \"shot\" might be several spliced together to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example, an early trick film. A closer look reveals the start of the physical shot featuring Mary’s severed \"head,\" although the entire film seems like one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "In his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as a paradoxical mix of \"Old-New.\" This literary style has faced criticism and praise alike, often being accused of lacking depth while simultaneously celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" masterfully blends elements from \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances, giving birth to the early Gothic style and a fresh form of literary expression. Walpole incorporates traditional theatrical components along with the 'modern' novel's natural mimicry, resulting in what he dubs \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently draws from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term used to describe various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unrefined compared to contemporary societal and literary \"progress.\" The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which offers readers deeper psychological insights into the characters, has ensured the genre's longevity, making it simultaneously antiquated and fresh to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, the knight's training process, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, valued chivalry for its representation of the ideal knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—qualities they perceived as lacking in their society. By incorporating chivalric ideals, the \"gothic past\" becomes romanticized, hinting at Gothic's future evolution into Romanticism, with the aim of bettering the present. Walpole, writing The Castle of Otranto during a politically tumultuous period, was disheartened by the potential future. Engulfed in politics and possibly unjust accusations, he may have believed that the inherent morality and \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era were absent in his contemporary society. This idea is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric ideals. Before Frederic's introduction, he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic is portrayed with numerous classic chivalric attributes; he is primarily a prince, has endured suffering, has been deeply affected by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of steps for transporting products from the customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and ultimately distribution to the consumer. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. Oliver outlined the comprehensive task of planning, executing, and overseeing the supply chain operations to efficiently fulfill customer demands. This process comprises six crucial components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain is production, serving as the cornerstone of the entire process. During this phase, decisions are made regarding the timing, purpose, location, and method of production. Managers must understand what consumers desire, often relying on market analysis to gauge customer demands. Once managers have assessed market needs, they can determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities. Following this, decisions are made about the production site, selecting the plant that best balances volume and quality, while ensuring customer satisfaction is prioritized. After finalizing the production location, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. This stage is critical, as every detail plays a significant role, and poor planning can lead to costly delays. For example, when I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had detailed guidelines for all aspects of their operations, from employee uniforms to truck shipments, ensuring smooth operations without confusion.\n\nThe second essential aspect of supply chain management is supply. This involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core competencies and forming outsourcing partnerships based on these choices. A company might have multiple production units for a single product, each with distinct equipment, staff, and expertise. Managers must determine which unit is most suitable for different stages of the production process. They may also opt to outsource work to other companies to enhance efficiency. Outsourcing is often used to achieve velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian literature often fascinates readers with its meticulous detail and its preoccupation with the era's upper classes. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while belonging to this period, diverge from these norms. These books introduce elements of mystery and the unconventional, which aren't typically seen in novels of this time, enhancing character depth by revealing their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"Suddenly, a barrage of perplexing and disorienting thoughts flooded his mind. It felt as though he was still walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were locked in a heated argument: their words echoed in his ears; and when he became aware of himself, … he realized he was speaking to them…. Abruptly, a gunshot rang out; cries and shouts erupted around him; lights flashed before his eyes amidst the chaos, as an unseen force whisked him away. Throughout these swift visions, there was a vague, uneasy awareness of pain, which continually exhausted and tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often incorporate mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike experiences, though their content and purpose differ in each context. In Oliver Twist, these strange episodes often provide insights into Oliver’s internal struggles, his suffering, and his understanding of the events around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it vividly, as if in a dream, while seeking help (see left). This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he relives his despair, detached from the initial shock, as the pain becomes a constant companion linked more to fear than surprise. With Oliver being so overwhelmed, the question arises of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it certainly was not his own doing. This event reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when in mortal danger. This selection implies a growing sense of defeat within Oliver, as if old Fagin has started to wear him down, forcing him to accept this despair, affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, one might assume that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for his own survival.\n\n\"The day passed by – day! There was no day; it vanished as soon as it arrived – and the night returned; a night so lengthy in its dreadful silence and yet so brief in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students. My role was to assist them in subjects they found challenging, though my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in third or fourth grade, as he was having significant difficulties with reading. I quickly realized that something was amiss; his reading struggles were quite unusual. While he could pronounce some letters perfectly, he completely faltered with others, which was quite perplexing. Adrian was of Latino descent, yet he spoke English flawlessly. Our progress was slow until I met his mother one day while supervising a few students who hadn't gone on a field trip. She spoke only Spanish, and despite my limited Spanish skills as a beginner, we managed to communicate. At that moment, it became clear to me: Adrian could read, but his grasp of the English alphabet was shaky. I’m not sure if this realization significantly impacted his progress, but I sincerely hope he's doing well now.\n\nI'm sharing this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It also illustrates that such obstacles aren't always as evident as one might assume. Even a child who speaks perfect English can face significant challenges when it comes to reading it. It's widely acknowledged that this issue exists, but what steps can we take to address it? In Adrian's situation, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no single solution. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, stands out as an excellent approach, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might be resource-intensive and offer limited benefits to most students, this is not the case. If these programs were standard practice rather than the exception, all children could gain from them. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is neither feasible nor realistic. However, employing bilingual aides or tutors is certainly a practical solution.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea of something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some attend Sunday school to explore this concept, others go to Temple, or look within for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs passed down from their parents, while others reject these ideas, insisting there's nothing beyond our individual understanding. We might embrace one belief system only to later shift to another. Regardless of the path chosen, we embark on a journey to define our spirituality through our unique perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness to enlightenment.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our house's front porch, listening to the rain hitting the tin roof and smoking cigarettes together. The rainwater flowed from the gutters, overwhelming the plants along the porch's edge. My father gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed part searching, part reflective. Over the past months, he had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, his hair thinning more than I remembered. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, frightened, and unable to discuss how much I would miss him, as talking about it would make it all too real. I hugged him, returned to my seat, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the dim June evening.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The chemo and radiation had not alleviated his suffering but had extended his life beyond the doctors' expectations; yet the benefit of prolonging his suffering remained elusive to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow such a thing. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If there was a God, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness his transition from this life to the next, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that gave me existence come to its end. I wanted to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone, and knew he wouldn't want his only child to be a mere observer at his death. I retreated into myself, curled up in bed for three days, awaiting the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for Republicanism in its early days. Primarily engaged in agriculture, Taylor's experiences in this field, coupled with a short stint in politics, shaped him into a figure known for his firm commitment and vocal stance on individual liberties and governance. His strong support for an agrarian lifestyle profoundly influenced his views on government issues. His dedication to sustaining what he viewed as the finest profession informed his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as having a unique chance to develop an ideal form of governance, unencumbered by existing traditions that might obstruct innovation. This allowed for the creation of a system focused on self-governance. He was a staunch believer in the inherent rights of individuals, asserting that these rights were interconnected; denying one would undermine them all, diminishing their overall value. Therefore, he argued that such rights should remain outside governmental interference. He suggested that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" individuals with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor argued that government must recognize the intrinsic good and evil within humanity. He held strong views on dualistic morality, asserting that since government is operated by people, it must inherently reflect human virtues and vices. He characterized good principles as those safeguarding private property, advancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He believed a government rooted in sound principles would remain just, even if led by those driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions but deemed it problematic only when it extended beyond fostering a society oriented toward the public good, creating smaller factions that thrived at others' expense. Thus, he concluded that a good government was essential to curb human nature's darker tendencies, requiring vigilant oversight to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many dedicated Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He championed a Federal government with very limited powers, restricted to those explicitly articulated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government could be costly and prone to tyranny. However, he also warned that a simplistic, literal reading of the Constitution was risky; without considering the framers' intentions, such an approach could easily be corrupted. Moreover, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the United States' true foundational document, as it more clearly defined the nation as a coalition of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind processed the view in front of me with a detached clarity. I observed in silence, with a keen awareness that avoided connecting the scene to any deeper understanding, as my mind dissected the image before me. Thoughts flickered in and out of my consciousness so fluidly that it seemed as though I had no distinct thoughts of my own, only an uninterrupted experience of my surroundings. \n\nOn a recommendation from an artist I once collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since childhood, I had aspired to learn drawing, and this book offered insights from the basics of pencil use to the brain's methods for interpreting lines. A technique in the book suggested using a square frame to focus on a specific part of an image, simplifying a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit in a kitchen—into a manageable study of that single bowl. \n\nYet, at that moment, as I stared at the bowl before me, I couldn't impose that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, I could only stand and marvel. Just as Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists displayed vibrant palettes, I found myself at the beginning of what might be called my Work in Brown. \n\nI reached for my chosen tool of artistry, as muscles tensed and relaxed, guiding my hand through space. My will took shape in what might have been a peak of creativity. Water swirled, smooth and clear, as bits of material broke away and vanished. With muscles tensing and twitching slightly more urgently on the second attempt, my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck fast at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet braced apart, and a green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned at the unsightly mess—a remnant of processed food left as a message for the unfortunate cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, and I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it formed a makeshift glove. Standing straight, then bending over, my hand slowly descended into the water, much like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers in America face alarming risks on the road. Multiple elements contribute to the troubling statistics associated with teenage drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is that teens' brains aren't fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is another significant factor that not only leads to more fatal accidents but also increases incidents of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also tend to be more prone to accidents when they are driving with their peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted research highlighting a link between the passenger's age and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, states like California have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours young drivers can be on the road and limit them from carrying other minors as passengers. However, I believe these provisional licenses are merely temporary fixes. Statistically, the youngest drivers are not prepared to manage the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even argues that individuals under 18 are too immature for a standard driver's license. His research, cited by USA Today, indicates that those under 19-20 often seek thrills through risky behavior. Thus, delaying the driving age until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes makes sense. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens could lead to even more deadly accidents, with the potential death toll escalating as more Baby Boomer children become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nAddressing this problem through legislation would be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before granting a full license, with mandatory practical driving hours required. The number of required hours could align with what most states already mandate—California, for example, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given the nationwide scope of the teen driving problem, uniform national legislation would be a sensible and potentially effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country.\n\nThe legislative approach I'm advocating for isn't groundbreaking.",
            "This document explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or “red flags.” Lastly, it discusses strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process auditory information efficiently and effectively. In more specific terms, (C)AP involves the perceptual handling of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities and are not classified as “hearing impaired”; the difficulty lies in the brain’s ability to distinguish words or separate conversation from background noise, which does not function as expected.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during the study of children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team comprising Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began devising tests for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) that supports dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD presents in various forms: affected individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially; they might find it challenging to differentiate between multiple “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); they may be unable to identify sound patterns or detect changes in speech (such as recognizing sarcasm from vocal tone); subsequent sounds might obscure earlier ones; they may lack the ability to synthesize sound clues for meaningful interpretation and action; and they could have difficulty determining the sequence of auditory information presented (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,” which might be carried out by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that assess auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process can include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors and responses to stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently successful for diagnosis, nor is there a known cause for the disorder. Many tests require the patient to differentiate between multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and evaluating the responses to those signals.",
            "Pursuing a career in social work, I aim to join the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and supporting families in distress. The values I bring to the field include service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to fostering better relationships among individuals, and a dedication to my own professional growth to maintain competence. These core principles are not only foundational to social work but are also deeply personal to me.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, though I was initially uncertain about the specific career path to pursue. During high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their issues or resorting to inadequate coping strategies. These observations influenced my decision to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still unsure about my career direction, I took a break. That summer, a visit to a friend's house introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was there seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he had contacted the police about his situation. Wanting to assist, I went to his parents' home and shared my concerns with the police officers, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. The officers, unable to take legal action, asked me to speak with the parents. During our conversation, the parents appeared anxious and made excuses, labeling their son's actions as \"manipulative.\" This encounter prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to address family conflicts that are often downplayed as \"simple.\"\n\nSocial justice is another essential value in social work. As a society, we claim to value each individual and mourn those we lose. Yet, the societal notion of \"individuality\" often aligns more with outdated traditions than true uniqueness. If society truly mourns lost individuals, why do we conform to be like \"everyone else?\" I embrace my individuality and resist conforming to societal norms. Throughout high school and college, I actively opposed social injustice: by expressing myself with unconventional hair colors, wearing clothes that matched my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered them. I am committed to social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The biological model examines genetic inheritance and health-related medical factors. Sociocultural models, on the other hand, consider environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia evaluates these models and discusses each research study selected to enhance understanding of the models. The research explanations and findings are then analyzed to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those connected to another mental disorder are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia suggests challenges in staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or spontaneous REM. While Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, Parasomnias are linked to behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder include sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review concentrates on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes genes, heritable components, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a key role in sleep and wakefulness regulation. A study involving mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically influence sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep-inducing responses. Inhibiting its firing can lessen anxiety and encourage sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to extend sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that findings from animal models like mice can be applicable to human studies. This indicates a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any receptor alterations could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This can negatively affect aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities requiring monotonous tasks and concentration.",
            "I've been attending University Park for roughly two and a half years now, spanning about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my first year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, practically at the eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It would take me up to 25 minutes to walk from my residence at Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, which is centrally located, particularly when the weather was uncooperative—a frequent occurrence in State College. An alum I spoke with, not much older than me, mentioned that not too long ago, the East Halls were separated from the rest of the university by wide expanses of vacant land. Today, that space has been transformed into sports fields, large new buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus keeps growing, moving between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What’s the best way to handle mobility issues? On a college campus, it’s the bicycle. Yet, bikes alone won't solve the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently chatted with a friend who had taken up biking again after several years. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are fantastic. For a while, it wasn’t trendy to ride one, but it’s really the best way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient travel method. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many students, I currently live off-campus, at a distance from the center equivalent to some dorms. Purchasing a bike has been my wisest choice this year. My classes are in the Thomas building, a brisk 25-minute walk from my residence. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my place, isn’t always easy to navigate, regardless of whether I'm biking or walking. While there are advantages to walking, I simply don't have the time. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable option for reaching class. Walking to Thomas daily would cost me an extra 30-40 minutes. That’s over two and a half hours each week, not counting the additional time required to walk to and from other classes and appointments. This is more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" there is a critical examination of the looming dangers posed by technological advancement and the capitalist framework that supports it, depicted through a dystopian society. Within this world, individuals prioritize the collective over personal identity and are programmed from birth to seek instant gratification as their ultimate goal. The inhabitants are depicted as mere pieces in a grand scheme, restricted to a singular ideology as enforced by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about the growth of these systems. Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, underscores the notion that Huxley’s narrative critiques the economic structures emerging during his era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where ordinary citizens remain unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal benefits. This is attributed to the ideological domination of the working class, clearly illustrated by the conditioning seen in \"Brave New World.\" Lower classes like the Deltas and Gammas lack true autonomy; through sleep-teaching, the urge to consume, spend, and indulge is prioritized. As mentioned earlier, this is manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, or the complete dominance of social classes by a separate group, is evident here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, fully embracing an ideology that sustains such a structure, namely capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes are born aware but remain passive, with few exceptions like Bernard. The dynamics between social classes, explored in depth later, highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine connections between individuals are nonexistent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips away personal freedom and expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, with interactions remaining surface-level. This is shown through male characters' comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions about their experiences. Additionally, each class's acceptance of its hierarchical standing reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering fulfillment of their societal roles mirrors Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they remain obedient, consume, and conform.",
            "A few years back, I attended an Islam course at CBC, where one of the lively debates centered around whether Islam is inherently hostile. In today’s world, this question seems more pertinent than ever. Reflecting on the post-9/11 period, I've noticed a shift in media portrayal from viewing Islam and extremists with hostility to displaying significant tolerance towards Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that someone with a name like Barack Obama, who has ties to Islam in his family's background, could become a presidential candidate.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography fascinates me because it appears to contrast with what I know about his history. Previously, I had the impression that Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and enforcing Islam upon them. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself, eventually attracting followers who recognized the truth in his teachings.\n\nInterestingly, the stories of Muhammad contain notable parallels with Jesus's ministry, particularly in instances like multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative approach suggests the writers aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and performing miracles without needing to prove himself. This portrayal seems to diminish the significance of Jesus Christ's miracles and life, as if borrowing from Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes many tales that seem intended to show people willingly converting to Islam. However, these accounts often rely on third-hand sources, with the author recounting stories passed through several individuals. While intended to lend credibility, I felt this approach made the stories seem more dubious and less convincing.\n\nWhat unsettles me most about the biography is its effort to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure characterized by humility, wisdom, and gentleness. Yet, historical accounts challenge this depiction, and I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly overshadowed as Christian thought evolved after his passing. Observing history broadly, one can notice Christianity gradually diverging from its original roots. In today's world, there is a growing consciousness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. Although traditionalists remain steadfast in their adherence to received teachings, they may not have a significant enough impact to sway the entirety of the population. Among Christians, there will be a substantial increase in historical awareness in the years to come. There will be a strong desire to differentiate between doctrines that were later incorporated into Christianity and the original intentions of its founder. This transformation could take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: there will be a significant reversal in the trajectory of Christian history. The movement will aim to strip away layers of doctrine, as if turning back the hands of time, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced on behalf of God remains, untouched by later interpretations. As this trend makes its way through the United States and Europe, inspiring many to worship as if they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will remain robust to guide this change. However, as the theological timeline regresses, the present extensive diversity within Christianity will begin to revert to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and various divisions, differences will give way to greater similarities. History is replete with notable reversions. For instance, Christians once faced persecution under the Roman Empire, which eventually became a Christian stronghold. Similarly, the United States transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversion will unfold within the Christian faith, unraveling history to reconnect with its origins, thereby reducing diversity in the process. A vital element enabling this shift will be an interpretive approach to Jesus' words, viewing them metaphorically rather than literally. But what transpired since Jesus' time? Delving deep into history, one finds Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures had become integral to the religion. The Jewish community was not unified, splitting into groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, alongside a majority of ordinary people.",
            "I am convinced that \"The Jungle\" reveals a fundamental aspect of human nature: an inherent inclination towards greed and self-interest. People tend to prioritize their own welfare and strive to enhance their own lives, often neglecting the needs of those less fortunate. This theme is evident throughout \"The Jungle,\" particularly through the depiction of factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their enterprises and achieving success, with little regard for any obstacles or harm their progress might cause. Upton Sinclair's narrative illustrates this through vivid imagery, such as when he describes the stark outlines of buildings against the sky and the relentless stream of smoke from towering chimneys, symbolizing the environmental damage and disregard for the wellbeing of others. The owners show no concern for the aftermath of pollution or the runoff from animal pens that contaminates the surroundings of Packingtown.\n\nEqually disturbing is the indifference shown by these managers and owners towards their workforce, who toil to increase their wealth. Driven by the desire to maximize profits, they exploit their employees mercilessly, as illustrated in the text: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long, grueling hours and face sudden layoffs without notice, severance, or assistance in finding new employment. Set during a time when labor laws and worker protections were virtually nonexistent, \"The Jungle\" exposes how managers and owners could push their workers to the brink, forcing them to endure hazardous conditions. Although the novel does not explicitly state it, it is clear that those who lived and labored in Packingtown were expected to endure appalling conditions both at work and in their daily lives. There were no support systems or resources available to assist the working class. While unions existed, they often exploited workers rather than aiding them, profiting from their plight. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe once described \"Dream-Land\" as one of his superior poems. Within this work, Poe mentions \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a term that Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island located north of Britain, perceived by the Greeks as the world's edge. While Virgil indeed employed this term, a more recent influence deserves recognition. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's awareness of Goethe's writings. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the resemblance between their poems, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" notes that Goethe was a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year Goethe passed away. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife's death, receives a goblet from her and subsequently succumbs to heavy drinking, mourning her loss. Eventually, he decides to part with his possessions, except for the goblet, and throws it into the sea from a cliff before closing his eyes and dying. The king's character in \"The King of Thule\" mirrors the somber tone found in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Additionally, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He refers to \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's bleak, lonely landscape, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color. These scenes echo \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe, where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his will to live or rule. The poem seems to depict a journey into the world of Goethe's work. Goethe was a prominent writer whom Poe would have known, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his appreciation for Tennyson, and through this connection, he would have encountered Goethe's work, widely reproduced after its initial publication.",
            "Under California law, is it possible for a customer who was injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to be granted punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was notified about the spill twice and neglected to have it cleaned up for half an hour due to eating dinner? A judge is unlikely to swiftly dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm that could result, and also demonstrate that the behavior was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have foreseen the potential harm from not promptly addressing a spill, considering that multiple D&D customers had slipped in the months before Palmer's incident; despite this, he neglected to clean the spill. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to implement measures to ensure store safety. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, dismissed the report, stating he didn't have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, who again dismissed it. At 5:30 pm that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, sustaining a severe back injury. Before her accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and the decision is being made on whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined in the statute as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, conduct that is \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as noted in id. at § (c)(1). Courts have described conduct as malicious when it involves a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From an early age, she felt an unyielding need for something she couldn't quite define. This longing began when she was around 14, just stepping into her teenage years, and it lingered as she turned 17. Over time, she realized it was a someone she sought, not a something. Despite this realization, no boys sparked her interest. Some tried to capture her attention with awkward charm, but none succeeded. She often pondered this peculiar absence of attraction, wondering what might be causing such a phenomenon in a teenage girl. Years of reflection led to theories, yet none were convincing enough to satisfy her curiosity. Thus, she continued her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents were mild-mannered and rarely disagreed, even with her. The only discord arose when she asserted her independence, expressing her vibrant personality, which contrasted with their calm demeanor. Despite this, her lively nature made her quite endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, a sudden cry from the kitchen, her mother's familiar voice, broke the tranquility. Rushing in, her heart raced as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing and gasping, repeatedly uttering \"Ow.\" Instinctively, she knelt beside her, offering comfort. \"Ouch... darling, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother managed to say through labored breaths. Sensing her mother’s severe pain, she quickly responded, \"Alright Mom, just tell me where to carry you.\" Following her mother's guidance, she was thankful for her strength, honed by classes, as she carefully lifted her mother into the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital greeted them with the familiar mix of disinfectant, illness, and anxiety. Yet, her thoughts were solely on her mother. She swiftly brought her into the building, calling loudly for medical assistance. Faces filled with concern surrounded them, and soon a rolling bed was provided to lay her mother on. As they wheeled her mother away for immediate care, she was left to wait, anxiety mounting.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a step stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf.",
            "The purpose of this research was to illustrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with a diminished chance of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower risk of death from stroke. The aMed diet is an adjusted form of the Med diet, emphasizing increased intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate amount of alcohol is also permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and an intervention trial demonstrated that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study—a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states—were followed. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses remained in the study throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation processes. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were labeled \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions categorized this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) were made by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and types of stroke.\n\nA stronger commitment to the Mediterranean diet, shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and strokes in women. Over a 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign boldly declares that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nStanding alone on a street corner, Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a piece of cardboard aloft, with this startling message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, also recognized as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, the country witnessed a series of street protests, marking the first such public demonstrations in a decade. Spearheaded by numerous Burmese monks, these protests came to be known as “The Saffron Revolution,” named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the public began to take notice after the early uprisings, and although the Burmese government initially permitted the monks to gather peacefully, the situation soon escalated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military junta. The military actively invaded and plundered monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned on sight, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for attending a street protest. While official figures state that 13 people were killed, a defected army officer, Colonel Hla Win, reported, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nSuch events are not unprecedented. These examples of atrocities are among the most recent, yet the desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens is as old as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their absolute rule over society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to guide their people to prosperity, and our then-president, George W. Bush, reportedly held regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, head of Stupid People Worldwide, an affiliate of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable instances of such governmental actions include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4th, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in this protest varies widely, with Chinese government reports citing 200-300 fatalities, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, with government support, systematically exterminated Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicity. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ is another extreme case, where people of Jewish descent were systematically rounded up and killed over several years and across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is significantly attributed to his long-lasting career and his ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While Ellington's piano presence may be understated in many of the pieces chosen for this discussion, his prowess as a composer is evident through his ability to craft intricate and rich compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington designed an environment where soloists could improvise freely, alongside composing tightly orchestrated segments that utilized the distinct styles of his musicians to bring forth musical concepts. This approach not only emphasized the orchestra's overall tone but also allowed the creation of unique and cohesive sounds tailored to each composition. Ellington's understanding of individual musicians' sounds and how they contributed to the ensemble's growth enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history. According to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's sound and pioneering spirit is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he utilized the voice as a jazz instrument, a technique he employed throughout his career. This early instance of using voice to add texture and color without lyrics is also a testament to his ability to enhance the soloists' styles, a characteristic prevalent throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, as follows: Chorus 1 introduces a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth and melodic voice, which turns rougher towards the end. Chorus 2 features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. In Chorus 3, a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register is complemented by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band echoing the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reed sections. Chorus 5, the piece's climactic moment, has the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by a syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. Chorus 6 returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique as an instrument. The tag features a brief vocal run followed by a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone. Ellington's use of voice to infuse tone color into this piece is a hallmark of his style that permeates his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his talent for tight orchestration with his keen sense of tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing interweaves Miley's vocal-like trumpet play with Cox's instrumental voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key figure in his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone to great effect.",
            "What drives the evolutionary patterns observed in organisms? Are there certain limitations or influences that steer their evolutionary paths? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this statement still holds true today. In recent times, mathematical models have been used to explore general aspects of mollusk shell formation, both through individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to use mathematical modeling, alongside experimental studies, to shed light on the processes that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes in Prunum. We utilized X-ray images of different Prunum species to identify measurable parameters that were then used for modeling both theoretical and real shell shapes. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create hypothetical shell forms that helped define the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. The findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to enhance the understanding of significant evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be compared to a structure that progresses over time through a full circle in space. The rotations or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central line. This line runs through the shell's central column, termed the columella. The growth rate of the whorls can differ, and a continuous line, called a suture, marks the boundary of each whorl. In most cases, the largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the final one. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"typical\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is outlined below. Initially, the shell should be viewed from the apical perspective to identify where the first suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two segments. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It's possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented both graphically and mathematically. After establishing a mathematical model, it's feasible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s process of shell formation.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has seen little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the nation is making progress in achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to reach their targets by 2015. The underlying causes of these deficiencies suggest a need to enhance the overall health system rather than just implementing specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by a skilled health professional, with 72% of births now falling into this category. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives who are unable to perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, the improvements in this area are somewhat misleading, and significant work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea who receive treatment from a healthcare provider. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is also a concern, with low service rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%. This figure highlights another issue: the disparity in healthcare access. While cesarean section rates are 7% in urban areas, they drop to only 2% in rural regions, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Access is primarily concentrated in urban locales. Furthermore, a 27% gap exists in healthcare utilization between the poorest and wealthiest segments of the population, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing services, likely due to prohibitive out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering how to enhance neonatal and maternal care metrics, the fundamental question is whether to adopt program-specific strategies or to bolster the health system as a whole, without particular emphasis on maternal and child care before and after pregnancy. Programmatic approaches are tempting because they offer focused, manageable goals and can yield quicker results. However, there are significant drawbacks. Prioritizing one area of the health sector can lead to reduced funding for others, and human resources may gravitate towards the well-funded area (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting family planning). Additionally, running multiple independent programs for a single issue can lead to service duplication and a lack of coordination, resulting in increased paperwork for resources and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the realm of Popular Music has expanded to encompass an incredible variety of genres, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list. To add to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, among others—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even more specific sub-sub-genres. Within this sprawling landscape, Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past four decades. This genre is expressive because it captures a wide array of emotions, though it often gravitates towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent not long after its inception, as musicians recognized its inherent flexibility and began to craft their own sub-genres, which in turn led to the creation of sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal genre has evolved to such an extent that it encompasses numerous niche groups, making it difficult to define what constitutes heavy metal. It has integrated elements from various other genres, yet, like all genres, it originated from a specific source. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend the essence of the metal movement and understand why it is considered a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. Metal musicians possess remarkable technical skills, evident in their command of their instruments. Unsurprisingly, the movement has also been significantly influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly wild and fantastical recordings, with drugs often cited as a catalyst for these creations. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, as much of popular music at the time lacked such an exploration of the darker side of emotions. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the intense, visceral elements prevalent during the Romantic Era. For instance, lyrics from the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles highlight the movement's darkness. This particular track reflects themes of volatility, often attributed to drug influence. It is regarded by some as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a Rolling Stones song that also embraced heavier, darker themes. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' weighty sound, leading to the inclusion of this track on The White Album.",
            "In the years leading up to the emergence of Surrealism, Henri Rousseau was already engaged in the pursuit of his own artistic vision, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is emblematic of this journey. The artwork not only depicts a woman marveling at the surreal landscapes of her dreams but also embodies Rousseau’s aspirations and struggles as an artist. From the outset, he yearned for recognition and acclaim from his peers and art enthusiasts, confronting an internal conflict in the process. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau’s lifelong challenge: to either emulate popular artistic styles to gain acceptance in the art world or to forge his own path with creative independence.\n\nUnderstanding The Dream requires a glance at Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith who enjoyed middle-class comfort. Deprived of formal art education, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until he was forty, although he was mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector. The death of his first wife, Clémence, along with the loss of eight infant children, left him with a daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow. Seeking solace, he turned to painting, a new beginning that offered him refuge. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasantry in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, embodying the dreams and aspirations common to his social class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance within the art community is understandable given his circumstances. Lacking formal training and starting his career later in life, he was creating art alongside more established modern artists. Recognition for his work came late, coinciding with the rise of Matisse as an artist. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon contrasts the two, noting that while Matisse feared falling into artistic clichés, Rousseau aimed to paint in a conventional manner to gain entry into the Artiste Français. Despite being competitors, their motivations and styles diverged significantly.",
            "Throughout history, many influential thinkers have explored the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I am convinced that there is an underlying reason for this connection. John Keats captures this idea in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding is acquired through education or personal experiences. Nevertheless, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems innate, as Keats suggests, without traditional instruction. Both fields endeavor to describe rather than dictate. Our analyses of morality and beauty primarily aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is appealing or why an action is ethical, rather than offer a set of rules for determining or producing good art or moral conduct.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morality can never fully encapsulate what makes something good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural significance, yet these elements alone do not define its artistic merit. Often, when asked about a preferred work of art or literature, people respond with something akin to, \"There's just something about it,\" before diving into a more detailed critique. I maintain that art and morals cannot be entirely distilled into a list of attributes. Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a piece of literature, an indescribable quality remains. I argue that ethics shares this characteristic. As Wittgenstein posits, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that the close relationship between morality and art arises from the profound way we experience them at a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. They affect us in a manner that is felt but not entirely articulated. This connection is particularly pronounced in the art of literature. According to McKean, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany stands as a formidable and unified nation, characterized by a rich tapestry of culture stretching from the alpine region of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This cultural essence extends from Cologne along the Rhine River, through Germany's central areas, to Dresden on the Elbe River. Given its distinct culture, it's no surprise that modern Germany has evolved from a diverse mix of sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania, though the etymology of the name is a subject of considerable debate among scholars and historians. The Roman historian Tacitus suggested that it originated with the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, who were called Germans after crossing the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to document the term \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he described his conflicts with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls and used it to differentiate between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germans, whom he had not. Some speculate that the name might have meant \"neighbor\" in the Gaulish language. In the initial chapter of his first book on these wars, Caesar remarked: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Other theories suggest that \"German\" might derive from the spear they wielded, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” which could imply that the Germans were boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nTacitus, in his work “De Origine et situ Germanorum” from AD 98, chronicled the origins of the Germans, observing: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would choose Germania over Rome? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, but ultimately, they mostly returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they settled along the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from their land and offering their expertise by enlisting in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Shakespeare's play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, eventually a person must abandon their assumed identity, or risk losing their true self. A significant challenge in ending such deception is the potential for alienation. Ultimately, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. While some may react indifferently upon learning they've been deceived, others may feel deeply offended by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of deception, particularly in the context of gender role reversal, brings forth numerous issues, with a central question being the motivation behind adopting a disguise of the opposite gender. For Viola, this shift is a protective measure: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola decides to pose as a man to safeguard herself. Her plan succeeds, but it isolates her from the women around her, severing an essential support network. Complicating matters, Viola is so adept in her masculine guise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, developing romantic feelings for her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own suppressed feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary audiences, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception can uncover hidden emotions, notably in Olivia and Orsino's cases. The play hints that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola's presence compels them to confront. Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of a perceived male identity, or does she harbor deeper feelings for women? Likely, this is not the case, as Olivia's character seems to satirize those who judge others solely by appearance. This is evident in how easily Olivia's affections shift from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually viewing Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often characterized by its harshness, particularly highlighted by the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the complexities of an entire colonial empire cannot be encapsulated in such a straightforward manner. The German colonial empire demonstrated a wide range of policies and governance styles, as diverse as its geographical expanse. Similarly, educational systems across these colonies were not uniform. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories received commendation from authors of the era.\n\nConversely, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was quite different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established state schools and significantly contributed to native education, in South West Africa, this responsibility was largely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government backing. Nevertheless, the government allocated considerable resources for the education of Europeans in the colony, creating state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation to missionary schools. These educational strategies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies proudly showcased significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct educational experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a focus on recent research concerning settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes toward native Africans.\n\nA significant body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, predominantly in German and penned during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems' characteristics in these colonies. Subsequent English-language writings broadened the discussion through comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted substantial differences among the educational systems of the various colonies. A key work addressing this topic is Cohen's study, which contrasts the educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa and examines the factors contributing to their differences. Cohen attributes many distinctive features of South West Africa's educational system to its large settler population.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa experienced a relatively temperate climate, despite significant areas being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the colony with the next largest European population, East Africa, had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an illustration of two countries that once experienced a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War between 1846 and 1848, a conflict in which the United States emerged victorious, gaining control over Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, subsiding just before World War I. The roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental disagreements on issues like religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31).\n\nSuch rivalries are not uncommon among countries sharing borders. Nations with contiguous boundaries often experience conflicting interests that foster adversarial relations. The U.S. and Mexico exemplify this pattern of enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both countries are geographically proximate to the United States and have historically been its rivals, unlike many other Latin American nations that have generally maintained amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences contributed significantly to the friction between the United States and Mexico, echoing a challenge faced by many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, this tension involved both ideological differences and a contest over crucial national interests. However, in this instance, the ideological discord centered on religious orientations rather than political systems. The deep-seated distrust stemmed from historical tensions between the English and Spanish, with both nations inheriting these sentiments from their colonial pasts, posing a significant challenge to fostering positive diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry, primarily concerning territorial issues like border raids from Mexican territory into the U.S. and other frontier complications. Incursions by bandits and outlaws into American border towns posed a persistent problem until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109). It ultimately concluded as American objectives transitioned \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) toward the end of the 19th century.",
            "Around fifteen years back, an unexpected illness left me suddenly disabled, a condition I had never imagined. At that time, I was working as a nurse. I had chosen this career because it offered the stability and security that I had longed for during my childhood. Growing up, I frequently heard, \"You'll always find work; people will always need medical care,\" which guided my decision-making into adulthood. Although my aspirations leaned towards becoming a scientist or a journalist—ideally a combination of both—I pursued nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46 years old, I found myself single, with little financial security, and unable to work. Today, I am still living with this disability and, after 15 years relying on Social Security Disability benefits, I have virtually nothing to call my own. While I manage to get by, each day presents challenges to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite life's uncertainties, I know this much: I could not have endured all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. When true adversity hits, personal strength can feel insufficient.\n\nMy experience underscores that emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable. No amount of preparation can guarantee overcoming every obstacle alone. While I agree that we in the U.S. should not rely excessively on a faltering government, I believe it is more beneficial for Americans to relearn trust, to offer and seek help from one another, instead of isolating ourselves with individual survival plans.\n\nConservatives often celebrate the \"rugged individualism\" that they claim built this nation, but in reality, our ancestors weathered adversity through compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach their destinations by going solo.\n\nSo, certainly, prepare yourself. I have my own disaster kit, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows against potential biological threats. I have multiple flashlights, an assortment of batteries, along with a store of candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources to cultivate a small farm and preserve your own food, it's an excellent idea. A wood stove is also a wise investment—provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut in addition to these preparations, take the time to connect with your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would eventually be recognized as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he distanced himself from worldly affairs, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings laid the foundation for Buddhism. The most traditional form of Buddhism is known as Theravada Buddhism, and this religion has a history of about twenty-five centuries. Over time, its appearance and practices have evolved since the days of Buddha. For example, in Sri Lanka, a country where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, the annual water-cutting ceremony is an event that many participate in, both monks and laypeople, even though Buddha himself never mentioned such a celebration. These changes extend from surface-level traditions to the deeper spiritual essence of the religion. Both the monastic community and lay followers within Theravada Buddhism have had to adapt their beliefs over time due to various influences, whether from within or outside the religion, and whether those influences were supportive or antagonistic.\n\nThis discussion will frequently refer to several important terms. Internal forces are those arising from within the Buddhist community itself, including both monastics and lay followers. External forces originate from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that intend to harm or actually harm Buddhism, often driven by negative perceptions. Benign forces are neutral, neither intending to harm nor help, though they may inadvertently do either. These distinctions will be important throughout this examination.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Followers take refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (community). The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka addresses the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is essential for ending Samsara, the cycle of birth and death, along with the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for living; laypeople are expected to follow five precepts, including abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants, while monks adhere to a more extensive set of rules. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine are the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, or suffering; second, the truth that attachment leads to suffering; and third, the truth that suffering can be transcended."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.

            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In negotiations, the influence of culture is profound and multifaceted. Defining culture extends beyond its visible aspects to what it signifies and what it is not. It is not a monolith or a singular entity, nor does it conform to uniformity. Oversimplified statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are generalizations that can be misleading. While recognizing cultural stereotypes can be useful, it is far more beneficial for negotiators to grasp how a culture impacts the negotiation process and what implications it may hold. When encountering a different culture, one naturally perceives it through the lens of their own, prompting comparisons.\n\nGaining insight into a foreign culture or mindset might require exploring its history or understanding its biases. Instead of judging or attempting to alter a culture, it is crucial to accept it as it is and operate within its limits, particularly during negotiations, especially when one's negotiating position is weaker. Similarly, when a negotiator is on unfamiliar ground, respecting traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural obstacles and advance the negotiations.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that culture transcends national or international boundaries. Many companies within a nation cultivate their own unique corporate cultures. For example, a business might prioritize lengthy office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture is evident in aspects such as employee dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), and delegation of tasks. Some companies promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others restrict it to company-sanctioned charities or events. Observing variations in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within the same company across different regions, from urban to suburban) highlights the diversity of perspectives within a societal culture. While some cultures might seem less stratified than American culture, appearing more homogeneous, this similarity merely prompts deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is crucial as they explain the rationale behind a culture's behaviors. For instance, in cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that emphasize hard bargaining may not rush to settle an agreement. Considering these general cultural tendencies is essential before entering negotiations. However, a negotiator benefits from learning about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This view is similarly shared by another thinker we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas. As both philosophers defend the same idea, our task is to determine which argument is more compelling. For the sake of brevity, let's assume they both correctly believe in the existence of the biblical God. Introducing a different concept of a deity would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as they defend a specific notion of God. Despite the strengths in their arguments, neither offers a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo delve into this issue, let's first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes finding understanding through faith, suggesting that evidence of God can be discovered within oneself. He claims that since God is present within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Although Anselm's ideas can be complex and occasionally unclear, his main point is that the proof of God resides in our minds. He implies that we don't need external evidence to recognize the truth of God's existence, as it is something we inherently know. This concept of believing without conclusive empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas holds a different perspective. Aquinas argues that God's existence can be demonstrated purely through reason and empirical evidence, requiring no faith. This approach could aid evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by attracting new converts without relying on their acceptance of the unprovable. Instead, they could be convinced through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: motion, causation, contingency, gradation, and design. Through these, he asserts that the logical necessity for God serves as proof of His existence. Just as one could infer the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic can reveal God's existence.",
            "Authors often employ various strategies to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers concerning significant themes. While some methods prove more effective than others, F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully incorporates a range of these techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives with nouns in unconventional pairings to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to objects and employs them for a similar purpose. A notable example of this latter technique is his use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, with meaning, which he later utilizes to evoke a particular emotional response in relation to an important object.\n\nThe symbolism attached to white/gray is one of uniformity, with white suggesting a more refined and upper-class quality, whereas gray conveys an aged and faded impression. This symbolism is established early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8)—in fact, white clothing appears prevalent: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Interestingly, the only moment white is absent is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, noting that \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further cements the meanings of these colors by associating them with mundane, common subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby’s party attendees appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's list, and Catherine’s apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). Additionally, ordinary people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sufficiently established the meanings of white/gray, he uses these colors to represent insignificance or conformity in various subjects. This technique is notably applied to Daisy. After a period without significant mention of these colors, Daisy is suddenly depicted \"dressed in white\" and driving \"a little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more as a component of uniformity, an object of Gatsby's desire (74). Fitzgerald continues to employ this technique to reinforce the idea of Daisy as a uniform presence, as seen in descriptions like the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts a robust agricultural sector, largely attributed to its temperate and sunny weather. The region is known for cultivating a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A strong demand exists for organic, community-supported agriculture (CSA) products in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk enjoy considerable popularity as well. Many organic farms extend invitations for tours, offering insights into their farming operations, and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. Such ventures enable landowners to leverage government programs' advantages while enhancing habitat, thus facilitating recreational use and creating prospects for farm tours and educational programs.  \n  \nEngaging in organic farming not only caters to a potentially profitable niche market but also often results in enhanced biodiversity of local flora and fauna, owing to the absence of chemical use in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be costlier than traditional farming methods. It necessitates more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also miss out on the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Practices that, while not directly linked to organic farming, benefit wildlife may also incur additional labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to cultivate specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Therefore, there are several reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profits and habitat quality.  \n  \nThe chosen land for this scenario is located near the town of Potrero, in the unincorporated area of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres, consisting of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. Situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the plan is under review and currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are in decline and may soon be listed, like the burrowing owls.  \n  \nThis area has a rich history, having been home to Native Americans for countless generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The parcel of land was originally part of a homestead patent and likely utilized for grazing or wood production over the decades. I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and explored available government programs to assess what options a small farmer might have to mitigate costs and maintain wildlife-friendly operations. As a model for what someone farming this land might aim to accomplish, I identified an organic farm within the same vicinity.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, a lasting, unalterable bond. This connection encompasses a range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, more than anyone else connected by such a bond, seeing themselves in their sibling. In moments of crisis, this bond reveals its true nature, whether for better or worse. As these emotions surface, they come with significant consequences. Part of grasping the emotions stemming from this fraternal link involves navigating the outcomes they entail. When one gazes into a brother’s eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the tumultuous emotions it brings. Set against a richly detailed backdrop, these boys embark on a doomed journey. The story reaches a climax where bitter disappointment and intense pride collide, leaving only one brother alive. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, alongside the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview, both heavily influencing his behavior.  \nThe protagonist’s behavior is largely driven by a single emotion: pride. From the onset of their adventures to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother to whom he could impart his skills, such as \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He envisioned a companion to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. These dreams are thwarted by Doodle's frail condition. Born with a severely weak heart, Doodle's survival was uncertain, let alone his participation in strenuous activities. For the young protagonist, bursting with fanciful dreams, the reality was crushing. His frustration even led him to consider harming his brother by suffocating him with a pillow—a shocking thought for a child. Yet, a simple smile from Doodle softened his heart, offering the protagonist a glimmer of hope. This suggests that his resolve was not firm; deep down, he had an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has progressed from basic to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. In the beginning, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, later to a book, and now, to a computer. When studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory data repeatedly through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the object's borders—where color changes abruptly—to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses decisions made during bottom-up processing to enhance your recognition of the box. In this case, top-down processing might help you recognize the object as a black box rather than a hole shaped like a box in the white background.\n\nAfter information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter evaluates the importance of the signal and decides which cognitive processes it should be directed to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might notice your name even in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, and the outcomes are repeatedly influenced by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for each sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some arising from how people retrieve memories, others from computer science or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial downturn. This period saw rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and significant damage to some of America’s key corporations. The recession continues to affect us today, prompting a critical question: what caused this crisis, and what measures can prevent a recurrence? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from reckless and shortsighted political choices that compelled banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. Institutions like Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pushed to back and repackage these loans into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, spreading the turmoil through the repackaged loans and affecting the broader economy. \n\nThe origins of this financial predicament trace back to 1999 during President Clinton's administration, as he sought to bolster his re-election chances by increasing his popularity. The administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt the pressure from shareholders to sustain its impressive profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: “But the government-backed corporation could face trouble in an economic downturn, possibly necessitating a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.” As outlined earlier and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending practices led to the economic collapse.\n\nA confluence of factors sent the economy into a downward spiral, including the intricate structure of new mortgages. In the years preceding the crisis, adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used, linking more sectors of the economy to the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets overextending their investments in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered the consequences. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a collective $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing about 30% of the nation’s GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. It's that part of your narrative where you get to spread your creative wings and soar, dazzling everyone with your enchanting, almost magical writing. Or, it's the section where your readers lose interest and possibly exit your story, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin, for instance, is known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not a writer's ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the classic advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin often finds herself entangled in lengthy passages where either nothing occurs, or too much happens. Exposition is that pesky little voice that tells you to breeze through the backstory to reach the more exciting parts (distinct from the voice that urges you to relay every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about past events, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, this occurs when one character shares a wealth of information with another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, this responsibility falls on the author.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her love at a specific place and time, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to be compressed into two pages, with both characters only exchanging a couple of lines each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating through his dialogue and actions how profoundly he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to express, in both subtle and significant ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if it's later stated explicitly in the story). Properly introducing the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and provide insights into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, and hints about her thoughts and dreams as mirrored through his perspective. You would mourn his loss alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate more substance beyond the basic plotline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, furnishing that substance is your task. (*glances at the metaphor, sighs, continues*) It's often tempting to skim over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he's an ex-Air Force member, currently the night manager at a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys weekend fishing trips, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live segment on NBC 4 this morning, August 13, 2011. The leading story featured a man from Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't reveal her name, but they did show his mug shot, which gave off a menacing impression. The story was brief, lasting only about two minutes since it was still unfolding. The details shared were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody. I felt the time spent on this story was adequate.\n\nThe second report focused on an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, there were no arrests or suspects. The SWAT Team was conducting the investigation. This story seemed brief, and I suspect this might be because it involved a black man or occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. Over the years, I've noticed that crimes involving minorities as victims tend to receive less media attention. In contrast, if a white child or adult is abducted or harmed, the media coverage is extensive. However, if the victim is a minority, the incident is lucky to get even a mention.\n\nAnother story covered a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided on the suspected location of the incident. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle struck the helicopter, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the responsible individual.\n\nThe following report discussed the rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. The segment was relatively brief, likely used as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also included a story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. He was estimated to be about six feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on his race and complexion.\n\nAnother report detailed the case of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if this was meant to sound harsher or for another reason. They also noted that he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment security aimed at tracking indices, commodities, or collections of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits typical of index funds with the individual stock advantages such as short selling, margin buying, and the option to buy as little as one share at a time. These attributes are appealing, particularly since ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, investing in ETFs requires paying a commission for trades, similar to stock transactions. One major advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite the clear advantages, it's prudent for investors to critically assess if these benefits, like diversification, are genuinely present and to what extent. To explore this, we will analyze the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF yields similar benefits to a diversified portfolio of these stocks, and to evaluate if alternative configurations of the same stocks might offer a better Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo streamline the evaluation of the ETF, focusing on every holding would be cumbersome, so we will consider only the top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Listed below are these top 10 holdings along with their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks reflect the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current asset percentages, adjusted to 100%, to compute their contributions to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio comprised solely these 10 stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The Beta and return calculations are detailed in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it’s apparent that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It’s also noted that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically different.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and adjusted to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the third month of the project, as shown in Figure 17, there was a significant decline in the number of commuter log submissions, which was somewhat disappointing and difficult to fully understand. At a New England campus, winter leads to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, which could partially explain the decrease. December marks the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is occupied with completing assignments and finalizing grades. Logging commutes might have simply been overlooked during this period. Additionally, December is when the busy holiday season begins, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to be on campus. Classes start again in late January for the spring semester, which might also explain the low number of logs during that time. However, this does not account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that any project like this has an initial surge of enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counter this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March to boost engagement, which led to an increase in log submissions. Thus, maintaining momentum was a challenge, particularly due to the natural decline in interest and the impact of holiday and semester breaks in academia. \n\nAnother hurdle for this project, as with any initiative promoting alternative commuting, is the preference for the freedom and convenience associated with driving. This is a deeply rooted cultural norm. Therefore, providing incentives is crucial to encourage alternative commuting. We offered a variety of prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local bookstore, and some larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car, might have influenced participation. This could have also helped address the drop in engagement. The prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, if the value of the prizes had increased over time, it might have helped sustain interest. The gift cards were well-received at the project's start, but announcing the addition of a few bicycles in December, followed by a hybrid or electric car in January, might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all of the trick films, totaling fifteen between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis mainly centered on detailing the poetics of the majority of these trick films and investigating the unique features evident in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films at the century's turn are confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, employing long and medium shots, and adhering to a strict one shot equals one film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s venture beyond these boundaries by incorporating elements such as multiple shots. \n\nA prominent feature shared among trick films is their filming within an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, neither following figures nor objects. This static composition was prevalent in early films, rooted in theatrical traditions, and for trick films specifically, influenced by vaudeville and magic performances. A limitation of this stage-like setup is that characters typically move laterally, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the screen. Even as they exit the frame, the camera remains fixed.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also results in predominantly long shots and occasionally medium shots, with close-ups absent from Edison’s trick films. This reflects theatrical and vaudeville practices where audiences viewed the entire act within the stage's frame. Like most early films, actors do not advance from the middle ground towards the camera, hence the absence of close-ups.\n\nEarly trick films often adhere to the formula where one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This typically restricts the length of these films to about a minute or less, contingent on the frames per second. It also confines the narrative or dramatic scope of the trick films, which usually focus on brief vaudeville-like tricks—magic, vanishing, or switching acts—without much storyline. Importantly, in a trick film, a single conceptual shot perceived by the viewer does not necessarily equate to one physical shot. A \"shot\" might be several spliced together to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example, an early trick film. A closer look reveals the start of the physical shot featuring Mary’s severed \"head,\" although the entire film seems like one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "In his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as a paradoxical mix of \"Old-New.\" This literary style has faced criticism and praise alike, often being accused of lacking depth while simultaneously celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" masterfully blends elements from \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances, giving birth to the early Gothic style and a fresh form of literary expression. Walpole incorporates traditional theatrical components along with the 'modern' novel's natural mimicry, resulting in what he dubs \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently draws from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term used to describe various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unrefined compared to contemporary societal and literary \"progress.\" The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which offers readers deeper psychological insights into the characters, has ensured the genre's longevity, making it simultaneously antiquated and fresh to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, the knight's training process, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, valued chivalry for its representation of the ideal knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—qualities they perceived as lacking in their society. By incorporating chivalric ideals, the \"gothic past\" becomes romanticized, hinting at Gothic's future evolution into Romanticism, with the aim of bettering the present. Walpole, writing The Castle of Otranto during a politically tumultuous period, was disheartened by the potential future. Engulfed in politics and possibly unjust accusations, he may have believed that the inherent morality and \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era were absent in his contemporary society. This idea is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric ideals. Before Frederic's introduction, he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic is portrayed with numerous classic chivalric attributes; he is primarily a prince, has endured suffering, has been deeply affected by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of steps for transporting products from the customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and ultimately distribution to the consumer. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. Oliver outlined the comprehensive task of planning, executing, and overseeing the supply chain operations to efficiently fulfill customer demands. This process comprises six crucial components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain is production, serving as the cornerstone of the entire process. During this phase, decisions are made regarding the timing, purpose, location, and method of production. Managers must understand what consumers desire, often relying on market analysis to gauge customer demands. Once managers have assessed market needs, they can determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities. Following this, decisions are made about the production site, selecting the plant that best balances volume and quality, while ensuring customer satisfaction is prioritized. After finalizing the production location, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. This stage is critical, as every detail plays a significant role, and poor planning can lead to costly delays. For example, when I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had detailed guidelines for all aspects of their operations, from employee uniforms to truck shipments, ensuring smooth operations without confusion.\n\nThe second essential aspect of supply chain management is supply. This involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core competencies and forming outsourcing partnerships based on these choices. A company might have multiple production units for a single product, each with distinct equipment, staff, and expertise. Managers must determine which unit is most suitable for different stages of the production process. They may also opt to outsource work to other companies to enhance efficiency. Outsourcing is often used to achieve velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian literature often fascinates readers with its meticulous detail and its preoccupation with the era's upper classes. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while belonging to this period, diverge from these norms. These books introduce elements of mystery and the unconventional, which aren't typically seen in novels of this time, enhancing character depth by revealing their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"Suddenly, a barrage of perplexing and disorienting thoughts flooded his mind. It felt as though he was still walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were locked in a heated argument: their words echoed in his ears; and when he became aware of himself, … he realized he was speaking to them…. Abruptly, a gunshot rang out; cries and shouts erupted around him; lights flashed before his eyes amidst the chaos, as an unseen force whisked him away. Throughout these swift visions, there was a vague, uneasy awareness of pain, which continually exhausted and tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often incorporate mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike experiences, though their content and purpose differ in each context. In Oliver Twist, these strange episodes often provide insights into Oliver’s internal struggles, his suffering, and his understanding of the events around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it vividly, as if in a dream, while seeking help (see left). This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he relives his despair, detached from the initial shock, as the pain becomes a constant companion linked more to fear than surprise. With Oliver being so overwhelmed, the question arises of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it certainly was not his own doing. This event reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when in mortal danger. This selection implies a growing sense of defeat within Oliver, as if old Fagin has started to wear him down, forcing him to accept this despair, affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, one might assume that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for his own survival.\n\n\"The day passed by – day! There was no day; it vanished as soon as it arrived – and the night returned; a night so lengthy in its dreadful silence and yet so brief in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students. My role was to assist them in subjects they found challenging, though my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in third or fourth grade, as he was having significant difficulties with reading. I quickly realized that something was amiss; his reading struggles were quite unusual. While he could pronounce some letters perfectly, he completely faltered with others, which was quite perplexing. Adrian was of Latino descent, yet he spoke English flawlessly. Our progress was slow until I met his mother one day while supervising a few students who hadn't gone on a field trip. She spoke only Spanish, and despite my limited Spanish skills as a beginner, we managed to communicate. At that moment, it became clear to me: Adrian could read, but his grasp of the English alphabet was shaky. I’m not sure if this realization significantly impacted his progress, but I sincerely hope he's doing well now.\n\nI'm sharing this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It also illustrates that such obstacles aren't always as evident as one might assume. Even a child who speaks perfect English can face significant challenges when it comes to reading it. It's widely acknowledged that this issue exists, but what steps can we take to address it? In Adrian's situation, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no single solution. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, stands out as an excellent approach, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might be resource-intensive and offer limited benefits to most students, this is not the case. If these programs were standard practice rather than the exception, all children could gain from them. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is neither feasible nor realistic. However, employing bilingual aides or tutors is certainly a practical solution.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea of something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some attend Sunday school to explore this concept, others go to Temple, or look within for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs passed down from their parents, while others reject these ideas, insisting there's nothing beyond our individual understanding. We might embrace one belief system only to later shift to another. Regardless of the path chosen, we embark on a journey to define our spirituality through our unique perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness to enlightenment.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our house's front porch, listening to the rain hitting the tin roof and smoking cigarettes together. The rainwater flowed from the gutters, overwhelming the plants along the porch's edge. My father gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed part searching, part reflective. Over the past months, he had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, his hair thinning more than I remembered. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, frightened, and unable to discuss how much I would miss him, as talking about it would make it all too real. I hugged him, returned to my seat, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the dim June evening.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The chemo and radiation had not alleviated his suffering but had extended his life beyond the doctors' expectations; yet the benefit of prolonging his suffering remained elusive to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow such a thing. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If there was a God, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness his transition from this life to the next, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that gave me existence come to its end. I wanted to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone, and knew he wouldn't want his only child to be a mere observer at his death. I retreated into myself, curled up in bed for three days, awaiting the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for Republicanism in its early days. Primarily engaged in agriculture, Taylor's experiences in this field, coupled with a short stint in politics, shaped him into a figure known for his firm commitment and vocal stance on individual liberties and governance. His strong support for an agrarian lifestyle profoundly influenced his views on government issues. His dedication to sustaining what he viewed as the finest profession informed his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as having a unique chance to develop an ideal form of governance, unencumbered by existing traditions that might obstruct innovation. This allowed for the creation of a system focused on self-governance. He was a staunch believer in the inherent rights of individuals, asserting that these rights were interconnected; denying one would undermine them all, diminishing their overall value. Therefore, he argued that such rights should remain outside governmental interference. He suggested that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" individuals with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor argued that government must recognize the intrinsic good and evil within humanity. He held strong views on dualistic morality, asserting that since government is operated by people, it must inherently reflect human virtues and vices. He characterized good principles as those safeguarding private property, advancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He believed a government rooted in sound principles would remain just, even if led by those driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions but deemed it problematic only when it extended beyond fostering a society oriented toward the public good, creating smaller factions that thrived at others' expense. Thus, he concluded that a good government was essential to curb human nature's darker tendencies, requiring vigilant oversight to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many dedicated Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He championed a Federal government with very limited powers, restricted to those explicitly articulated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government could be costly and prone to tyranny. However, he also warned that a simplistic, literal reading of the Constitution was risky; without considering the framers' intentions, such an approach could easily be corrupted. Moreover, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the United States' true foundational document, as it more clearly defined the nation as a coalition of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind processed the view in front of me with a detached clarity. I observed in silence, with a keen awareness that avoided connecting the scene to any deeper understanding, as my mind dissected the image before me. Thoughts flickered in and out of my consciousness so fluidly that it seemed as though I had no distinct thoughts of my own, only an uninterrupted experience of my surroundings. \n\nOn a recommendation from an artist I once collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since childhood, I had aspired to learn drawing, and this book offered insights from the basics of pencil use to the brain's methods for interpreting lines. A technique in the book suggested using a square frame to focus on a specific part of an image, simplifying a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit in a kitchen—into a manageable study of that single bowl. \n\nYet, at that moment, as I stared at the bowl before me, I couldn't impose that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, I could only stand and marvel. Just as Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists displayed vibrant palettes, I found myself at the beginning of what might be called my Work in Brown. \n\nI reached for my chosen tool of artistry, as muscles tensed and relaxed, guiding my hand through space. My will took shape in what might have been a peak of creativity. Water swirled, smooth and clear, as bits of material broke away and vanished. With muscles tensing and twitching slightly more urgently on the second attempt, my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck fast at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet braced apart, and a green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned at the unsightly mess—a remnant of processed food left as a message for the unfortunate cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, and I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it formed a makeshift glove. Standing straight, then bending over, my hand slowly descended into the water, much like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers in America face alarming risks on the road. Multiple elements contribute to the troubling statistics associated with teenage drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is that teens' brains aren't fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is another significant factor that not only leads to more fatal accidents but also increases incidents of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also tend to be more prone to accidents when they are driving with their peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted research highlighting a link between the passenger's age and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, states like California have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours young drivers can be on the road and limit them from carrying other minors as passengers. However, I believe these provisional licenses are merely temporary fixes. Statistically, the youngest drivers are not prepared to manage the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even argues that individuals under 18 are too immature for a standard driver's license. His research, cited by USA Today, indicates that those under 19-20 often seek thrills through risky behavior. Thus, delaying the driving age until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes makes sense. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens could lead to even more deadly accidents, with the potential death toll escalating as more Baby Boomer children become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nAddressing this problem through legislation would be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before granting a full license, with mandatory practical driving hours required. The number of required hours could align with what most states already mandate—California, for example, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given the nationwide scope of the teen driving problem, uniform national legislation would be a sensible and potentially effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country.\n\nThe legislative approach I'm advocating for isn't groundbreaking.",
            "This document explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or “red flags.” Lastly, it discusses strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process auditory information efficiently and effectively. In more specific terms, (C)AP involves the perceptual handling of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities and are not classified as “hearing impaired”; the difficulty lies in the brain’s ability to distinguish words or separate conversation from background noise, which does not function as expected.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during the study of children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team comprising Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began devising tests for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) that supports dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD presents in various forms: affected individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially; they might find it challenging to differentiate between multiple “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); they may be unable to identify sound patterns or detect changes in speech (such as recognizing sarcasm from vocal tone); subsequent sounds might obscure earlier ones; they may lack the ability to synthesize sound clues for meaningful interpretation and action; and they could have difficulty determining the sequence of auditory information presented (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,” which might be carried out by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that assess auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process can include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors and responses to stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently successful for diagnosis, nor is there a known cause for the disorder. Many tests require the patient to differentiate between multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and evaluating the responses to those signals.",
            "Pursuing a career in social work, I aim to join the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and supporting families in distress. The values I bring to the field include service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to fostering better relationships among individuals, and a dedication to my own professional growth to maintain competence. These core principles are not only foundational to social work but are also deeply personal to me.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, though I was initially uncertain about the specific career path to pursue. During high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their issues or resorting to inadequate coping strategies. These observations influenced my decision to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still unsure about my career direction, I took a break. That summer, a visit to a friend's house introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was there seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he had contacted the police about his situation. Wanting to assist, I went to his parents' home and shared my concerns with the police officers, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. The officers, unable to take legal action, asked me to speak with the parents. During our conversation, the parents appeared anxious and made excuses, labeling their son's actions as \"manipulative.\" This encounter prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to address family conflicts that are often downplayed as \"simple.\"\n\nSocial justice is another essential value in social work. As a society, we claim to value each individual and mourn those we lose. Yet, the societal notion of \"individuality\" often aligns more with outdated traditions than true uniqueness. If society truly mourns lost individuals, why do we conform to be like \"everyone else?\" I embrace my individuality and resist conforming to societal norms. Throughout high school and college, I actively opposed social injustice: by expressing myself with unconventional hair colors, wearing clothes that matched my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered them. I am committed to social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The biological model examines genetic inheritance and health-related medical factors. Sociocultural models, on the other hand, consider environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia evaluates these models and discusses each research study selected to enhance understanding of the models. The research explanations and findings are then analyzed to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those connected to another mental disorder are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia suggests challenges in staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or spontaneous REM. While Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, Parasomnias are linked to behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder include sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review concentrates on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes genes, heritable components, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a key role in sleep and wakefulness regulation. A study involving mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically influence sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep-inducing responses. Inhibiting its firing can lessen anxiety and encourage sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to extend sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that findings from animal models like mice can be applicable to human studies. This indicates a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any receptor alterations could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This can negatively affect aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities requiring monotonous tasks and concentration.",
            "I've been attending University Park for roughly two and a half years now, spanning about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my first year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, practically at the eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It would take me up to 25 minutes to walk from my residence at Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, which is centrally located, particularly when the weather was uncooperative—a frequent occurrence in State College. An alum I spoke with, not much older than me, mentioned that not too long ago, the East Halls were separated from the rest of the university by wide expanses of vacant land. Today, that space has been transformed into sports fields, large new buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus keeps growing, moving between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What’s the best way to handle mobility issues? On a college campus, it’s the bicycle. Yet, bikes alone won't solve the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently chatted with a friend who had taken up biking again after several years. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are fantastic. For a while, it wasn’t trendy to ride one, but it’s really the best way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient travel method. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many students, I currently live off-campus, at a distance from the center equivalent to some dorms. Purchasing a bike has been my wisest choice this year. My classes are in the Thomas building, a brisk 25-minute walk from my residence. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my place, isn’t always easy to navigate, regardless of whether I'm biking or walking. While there are advantages to walking, I simply don't have the time. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable option for reaching class. Walking to Thomas daily would cost me an extra 30-40 minutes. That’s over two and a half hours each week, not counting the additional time required to walk to and from other classes and appointments. This is more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" there is a critical examination of the looming dangers posed by technological advancement and the capitalist framework that supports it, depicted through a dystopian society. Within this world, individuals prioritize the collective over personal identity and are programmed from birth to seek instant gratification as their ultimate goal. The inhabitants are depicted as mere pieces in a grand scheme, restricted to a singular ideology as enforced by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about the growth of these systems. Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, underscores the notion that Huxley’s narrative critiques the economic structures emerging during his era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where ordinary citizens remain unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal benefits. This is attributed to the ideological domination of the working class, clearly illustrated by the conditioning seen in \"Brave New World.\" Lower classes like the Deltas and Gammas lack true autonomy; through sleep-teaching, the urge to consume, spend, and indulge is prioritized. As mentioned earlier, this is manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, or the complete dominance of social classes by a separate group, is evident here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, fully embracing an ideology that sustains such a structure, namely capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes are born aware but remain passive, with few exceptions like Bernard. The dynamics between social classes, explored in depth later, highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine connections between individuals are nonexistent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips away personal freedom and expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, with interactions remaining surface-level. This is shown through male characters' comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions about their experiences. Additionally, each class's acceptance of its hierarchical standing reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering fulfillment of their societal roles mirrors Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they remain obedient, consume, and conform.",
            "A few years back, I attended an Islam course at CBC, where one of the lively debates centered around whether Islam is inherently hostile. In today’s world, this question seems more pertinent than ever. Reflecting on the post-9/11 period, I've noticed a shift in media portrayal from viewing Islam and extremists with hostility to displaying significant tolerance towards Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that someone with a name like Barack Obama, who has ties to Islam in his family's background, could become a presidential candidate.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography fascinates me because it appears to contrast with what I know about his history. Previously, I had the impression that Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and enforcing Islam upon them. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself, eventually attracting followers who recognized the truth in his teachings.\n\nInterestingly, the stories of Muhammad contain notable parallels with Jesus's ministry, particularly in instances like multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative approach suggests the writers aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and performing miracles without needing to prove himself. This portrayal seems to diminish the significance of Jesus Christ's miracles and life, as if borrowing from Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes many tales that seem intended to show people willingly converting to Islam. However, these accounts often rely on third-hand sources, with the author recounting stories passed through several individuals. While intended to lend credibility, I felt this approach made the stories seem more dubious and less convincing.\n\nWhat unsettles me most about the biography is its effort to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure characterized by humility, wisdom, and gentleness. Yet, historical accounts challenge this depiction, and I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly overshadowed as Christian thought evolved after his passing. Observing history broadly, one can notice Christianity gradually diverging from its original roots. In today's world, there is a growing consciousness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. Although traditionalists remain steadfast in their adherence to received teachings, they may not have a significant enough impact to sway the entirety of the population. Among Christians, there will be a substantial increase in historical awareness in the years to come. There will be a strong desire to differentiate between doctrines that were later incorporated into Christianity and the original intentions of its founder. This transformation could take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: there will be a significant reversal in the trajectory of Christian history. The movement will aim to strip away layers of doctrine, as if turning back the hands of time, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced on behalf of God remains, untouched by later interpretations. As this trend makes its way through the United States and Europe, inspiring many to worship as if they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will remain robust to guide this change. However, as the theological timeline regresses, the present extensive diversity within Christianity will begin to revert to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and various divisions, differences will give way to greater similarities. History is replete with notable reversions. For instance, Christians once faced persecution under the Roman Empire, which eventually became a Christian stronghold. Similarly, the United States transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversion will unfold within the Christian faith, unraveling history to reconnect with its origins, thereby reducing diversity in the process. A vital element enabling this shift will be an interpretive approach to Jesus' words, viewing them metaphorically rather than literally. But what transpired since Jesus' time? Delving deep into history, one finds Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures had become integral to the religion. The Jewish community was not unified, splitting into groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, alongside a majority of ordinary people.",
            "I am convinced that \"The Jungle\" reveals a fundamental aspect of human nature: an inherent inclination towards greed and self-interest. People tend to prioritize their own welfare and strive to enhance their own lives, often neglecting the needs of those less fortunate. This theme is evident throughout \"The Jungle,\" particularly through the depiction of factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their enterprises and achieving success, with little regard for any obstacles or harm their progress might cause. Upton Sinclair's narrative illustrates this through vivid imagery, such as when he describes the stark outlines of buildings against the sky and the relentless stream of smoke from towering chimneys, symbolizing the environmental damage and disregard for the wellbeing of others. The owners show no concern for the aftermath of pollution or the runoff from animal pens that contaminates the surroundings of Packingtown.\n\nEqually disturbing is the indifference shown by these managers and owners towards their workforce, who toil to increase their wealth. Driven by the desire to maximize profits, they exploit their employees mercilessly, as illustrated in the text: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long, grueling hours and face sudden layoffs without notice, severance, or assistance in finding new employment. Set during a time when labor laws and worker protections were virtually nonexistent, \"The Jungle\" exposes how managers and owners could push their workers to the brink, forcing them to endure hazardous conditions. Although the novel does not explicitly state it, it is clear that those who lived and labored in Packingtown were expected to endure appalling conditions both at work and in their daily lives. There were no support systems or resources available to assist the working class. While unions existed, they often exploited workers rather than aiding them, profiting from their plight. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe once described \"Dream-Land\" as one of his superior poems. Within this work, Poe mentions \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a term that Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island located north of Britain, perceived by the Greeks as the world's edge. While Virgil indeed employed this term, a more recent influence deserves recognition. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's awareness of Goethe's writings. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the resemblance between their poems, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" notes that Goethe was a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year Goethe passed away. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife's death, receives a goblet from her and subsequently succumbs to heavy drinking, mourning her loss. Eventually, he decides to part with his possessions, except for the goblet, and throws it into the sea from a cliff before closing his eyes and dying. The king's character in \"The King of Thule\" mirrors the somber tone found in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Additionally, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He refers to \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's bleak, lonely landscape, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color. These scenes echo \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe, where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his will to live or rule. The poem seems to depict a journey into the world of Goethe's work. Goethe was a prominent writer whom Poe would have known, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his appreciation for Tennyson, and through this connection, he would have encountered Goethe's work, widely reproduced after its initial publication.",
            "Under California law, is it possible for a customer who was injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to be granted punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was notified about the spill twice and neglected to have it cleaned up for half an hour due to eating dinner? A judge is unlikely to swiftly dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm that could result, and also demonstrate that the behavior was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have foreseen the potential harm from not promptly addressing a spill, considering that multiple D&D customers had slipped in the months before Palmer's incident; despite this, he neglected to clean the spill. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to implement measures to ensure store safety. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, dismissed the report, stating he didn't have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, who again dismissed it. At 5:30 pm that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, sustaining a severe back injury. Before her accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and the decision is being made on whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined in the statute as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, conduct that is \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as noted in id. at § (c)(1). Courts have described conduct as malicious when it involves a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From an early age, she felt an unyielding need for something she couldn't quite define. This longing began when she was around 14, just stepping into her teenage years, and it lingered as she turned 17. Over time, she realized it was a someone she sought, not a something. Despite this realization, no boys sparked her interest. Some tried to capture her attention with awkward charm, but none succeeded. She often pondered this peculiar absence of attraction, wondering what might be causing such a phenomenon in a teenage girl. Years of reflection led to theories, yet none were convincing enough to satisfy her curiosity. Thus, she continued her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents were mild-mannered and rarely disagreed, even with her. The only discord arose when she asserted her independence, expressing her vibrant personality, which contrasted with their calm demeanor. Despite this, her lively nature made her quite endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, a sudden cry from the kitchen, her mother's familiar voice, broke the tranquility. Rushing in, her heart raced as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing and gasping, repeatedly uttering \"Ow.\" Instinctively, she knelt beside her, offering comfort. \"Ouch... darling, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother managed to say through labored breaths. Sensing her mother’s severe pain, she quickly responded, \"Alright Mom, just tell me where to carry you.\" Following her mother's guidance, she was thankful for her strength, honed by classes, as she carefully lifted her mother into the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital greeted them with the familiar mix of disinfectant, illness, and anxiety. Yet, her thoughts were solely on her mother. She swiftly brought her into the building, calling loudly for medical assistance. Faces filled with concern surrounded them, and soon a rolling bed was provided to lay her mother on. As they wheeled her mother away for immediate care, she was left to wait, anxiety mounting.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a step stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf.",
            "The purpose of this research was to illustrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with a diminished chance of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower risk of death from stroke. The aMed diet is an adjusted form of the Med diet, emphasizing increased intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate amount of alcohol is also permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and an intervention trial demonstrated that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study—a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states—were followed. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses remained in the study throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation processes. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were labeled \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions categorized this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) were made by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and types of stroke.\n\nA stronger commitment to the Mediterranean diet, shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and strokes in women. Over a 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign boldly declares that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nStanding alone on a street corner, Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a piece of cardboard aloft, with this startling message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, also recognized as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, the country witnessed a series of street protests, marking the first such public demonstrations in a decade. Spearheaded by numerous Burmese monks, these protests came to be known as “The Saffron Revolution,” named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the public began to take notice after the early uprisings, and although the Burmese government initially permitted the monks to gather peacefully, the situation soon escalated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military junta. The military actively invaded and plundered monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned on sight, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for attending a street protest. While official figures state that 13 people were killed, a defected army officer, Colonel Hla Win, reported, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nSuch events are not unprecedented. These examples of atrocities are among the most recent, yet the desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens is as old as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their absolute rule over society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to guide their people to prosperity, and our then-president, George W. Bush, reportedly held regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, head of Stupid People Worldwide, an affiliate of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable instances of such governmental actions include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4th, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in this protest varies widely, with Chinese government reports citing 200-300 fatalities, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, with government support, systematically exterminated Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicity. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ is another extreme case, where people of Jewish descent were systematically rounded up and killed over several years and across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is significantly attributed to his long-lasting career and his ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While Ellington's piano presence may be understated in many of the pieces chosen for this discussion, his prowess as a composer is evident through his ability to craft intricate and rich compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington designed an environment where soloists could improvise freely, alongside composing tightly orchestrated segments that utilized the distinct styles of his musicians to bring forth musical concepts. This approach not only emphasized the orchestra's overall tone but also allowed the creation of unique and cohesive sounds tailored to each composition. Ellington's understanding of individual musicians' sounds and how they contributed to the ensemble's growth enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history. According to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's sound and pioneering spirit is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he utilized the voice as a jazz instrument, a technique he employed throughout his career. This early instance of using voice to add texture and color without lyrics is also a testament to his ability to enhance the soloists' styles, a characteristic prevalent throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, as follows: Chorus 1 introduces a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth and melodic voice, which turns rougher towards the end. Chorus 2 features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. In Chorus 3, a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register is complemented by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band echoing the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reed sections. Chorus 5, the piece's climactic moment, has the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by a syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. Chorus 6 returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique as an instrument. The tag features a brief vocal run followed by a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone. Ellington's use of voice to infuse tone color into this piece is a hallmark of his style that permeates his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his talent for tight orchestration with his keen sense of tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing interweaves Miley's vocal-like trumpet play with Cox's instrumental voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key figure in his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone to great effect.",
            "What drives the evolutionary patterns observed in organisms? Are there certain limitations or influences that steer their evolutionary paths? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this statement still holds true today. In recent times, mathematical models have been used to explore general aspects of mollusk shell formation, both through individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to use mathematical modeling, alongside experimental studies, to shed light on the processes that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes in Prunum. We utilized X-ray images of different Prunum species to identify measurable parameters that were then used for modeling both theoretical and real shell shapes. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create hypothetical shell forms that helped define the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. The findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to enhance the understanding of significant evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be compared to a structure that progresses over time through a full circle in space. The rotations or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central line. This line runs through the shell's central column, termed the columella. The growth rate of the whorls can differ, and a continuous line, called a suture, marks the boundary of each whorl. In most cases, the largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the final one. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"typical\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is outlined below. Initially, the shell should be viewed from the apical perspective to identify where the first suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two segments. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It's possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented both graphically and mathematically. After establishing a mathematical model, it's feasible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s process of shell formation.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has seen little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the nation is making progress in achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to reach their targets by 2015. The underlying causes of these deficiencies suggest a need to enhance the overall health system rather than just implementing specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by a skilled health professional, with 72% of births now falling into this category. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives who are unable to perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, the improvements in this area are somewhat misleading, and significant work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea who receive treatment from a healthcare provider. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is also a concern, with low service rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%. This figure highlights another issue: the disparity in healthcare access. While cesarean section rates are 7% in urban areas, they drop to only 2% in rural regions, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Access is primarily concentrated in urban locales. Furthermore, a 27% gap exists in healthcare utilization between the poorest and wealthiest segments of the population, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing services, likely due to prohibitive out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering how to enhance neonatal and maternal care metrics, the fundamental question is whether to adopt program-specific strategies or to bolster the health system as a whole, without particular emphasis on maternal and child care before and after pregnancy. Programmatic approaches are tempting because they offer focused, manageable goals and can yield quicker results. However, there are significant drawbacks. Prioritizing one area of the health sector can lead to reduced funding for others, and human resources may gravitate towards the well-funded area (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting family planning). Additionally, running multiple independent programs for a single issue can lead to service duplication and a lack of coordination, resulting in increased paperwork for resources and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the realm of Popular Music has expanded to encompass an incredible variety of genres, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list. To add to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, among others—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even more specific sub-sub-genres. Within this sprawling landscape, Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past four decades. This genre is expressive because it captures a wide array of emotions, though it often gravitates towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent not long after its inception, as musicians recognized its inherent flexibility and began to craft their own sub-genres, which in turn led to the creation of sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal genre has evolved to such an extent that it encompasses numerous niche groups, making it difficult to define what constitutes heavy metal. It has integrated elements from various other genres, yet, like all genres, it originated from a specific source. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend the essence of the metal movement and understand why it is considered a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. Metal musicians possess remarkable technical skills, evident in their command of their instruments. Unsurprisingly, the movement has also been significantly influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly wild and fantastical recordings, with drugs often cited as a catalyst for these creations. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, as much of popular music at the time lacked such an exploration of the darker side of emotions. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the intense, visceral elements prevalent during the Romantic Era. For instance, lyrics from the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles highlight the movement's darkness. This particular track reflects themes of volatility, often attributed to drug influence. It is regarded by some as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a Rolling Stones song that also embraced heavier, darker themes. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' weighty sound, leading to the inclusion of this track on The White Album.",
            "In the years leading up to the emergence of Surrealism, Henri Rousseau was already engaged in the pursuit of his own artistic vision, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is emblematic of this journey. The artwork not only depicts a woman marveling at the surreal landscapes of her dreams but also embodies Rousseau’s aspirations and struggles as an artist. From the outset, he yearned for recognition and acclaim from his peers and art enthusiasts, confronting an internal conflict in the process. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau’s lifelong challenge: to either emulate popular artistic styles to gain acceptance in the art world or to forge his own path with creative independence.\n\nUnderstanding The Dream requires a glance at Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith who enjoyed middle-class comfort. Deprived of formal art education, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until he was forty, although he was mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector. The death of his first wife, Clémence, along with the loss of eight infant children, left him with a daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow. Seeking solace, he turned to painting, a new beginning that offered him refuge. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasantry in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, embodying the dreams and aspirations common to his social class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance within the art community is understandable given his circumstances. Lacking formal training and starting his career later in life, he was creating art alongside more established modern artists. Recognition for his work came late, coinciding with the rise of Matisse as an artist. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon contrasts the two, noting that while Matisse feared falling into artistic clichés, Rousseau aimed to paint in a conventional manner to gain entry into the Artiste Français. Despite being competitors, their motivations and styles diverged significantly.",
            "Throughout history, many influential thinkers have explored the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I am convinced that there is an underlying reason for this connection. John Keats captures this idea in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding is acquired through education or personal experiences. Nevertheless, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems innate, as Keats suggests, without traditional instruction. Both fields endeavor to describe rather than dictate. Our analyses of morality and beauty primarily aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is appealing or why an action is ethical, rather than offer a set of rules for determining or producing good art or moral conduct.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morality can never fully encapsulate what makes something good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural significance, yet these elements alone do not define its artistic merit. Often, when asked about a preferred work of art or literature, people respond with something akin to, \"There's just something about it,\" before diving into a more detailed critique. I maintain that art and morals cannot be entirely distilled into a list of attributes. Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a piece of literature, an indescribable quality remains. I argue that ethics shares this characteristic. As Wittgenstein posits, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that the close relationship between morality and art arises from the profound way we experience them at a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. They affect us in a manner that is felt but not entirely articulated. This connection is particularly pronounced in the art of literature. According to McKean, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany stands as a formidable and unified nation, characterized by a rich tapestry of culture stretching from the alpine region of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This cultural essence extends from Cologne along the Rhine River, through Germany's central areas, to Dresden on the Elbe River. Given its distinct culture, it's no surprise that modern Germany has evolved from a diverse mix of sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania, though the etymology of the name is a subject of considerable debate among scholars and historians. The Roman historian Tacitus suggested that it originated with the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, who were called Germans after crossing the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to document the term \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he described his conflicts with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls and used it to differentiate between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germans, whom he had not. Some speculate that the name might have meant \"neighbor\" in the Gaulish language. In the initial chapter of his first book on these wars, Caesar remarked: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Other theories suggest that \"German\" might derive from the spear they wielded, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” which could imply that the Germans were boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nTacitus, in his work “De Origine et situ Germanorum” from AD 98, chronicled the origins of the Germans, observing: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would choose Germania over Rome? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, but ultimately, they mostly returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they settled along the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from their land and offering their expertise by enlisting in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Shakespeare's play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, eventually a person must abandon their assumed identity, or risk losing their true self. A significant challenge in ending such deception is the potential for alienation. Ultimately, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. While some may react indifferently upon learning they've been deceived, others may feel deeply offended by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of deception, particularly in the context of gender role reversal, brings forth numerous issues, with a central question being the motivation behind adopting a disguise of the opposite gender. For Viola, this shift is a protective measure: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola decides to pose as a man to safeguard herself. Her plan succeeds, but it isolates her from the women around her, severing an essential support network. Complicating matters, Viola is so adept in her masculine guise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, developing romantic feelings for her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own suppressed feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary audiences, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception can uncover hidden emotions, notably in Olivia and Orsino's cases. The play hints that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola's presence compels them to confront. Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of a perceived male identity, or does she harbor deeper feelings for women? Likely, this is not the case, as Olivia's character seems to satirize those who judge others solely by appearance. This is evident in how easily Olivia's affections shift from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually viewing Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often characterized by its harshness, particularly highlighted by the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the complexities of an entire colonial empire cannot be encapsulated in such a straightforward manner. The German colonial empire demonstrated a wide range of policies and governance styles, as diverse as its geographical expanse. Similarly, educational systems across these colonies were not uniform. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories received commendation from authors of the era.\n\nConversely, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was quite different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established state schools and significantly contributed to native education, in South West Africa, this responsibility was largely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government backing. Nevertheless, the government allocated considerable resources for the education of Europeans in the colony, creating state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation to missionary schools. These educational strategies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies proudly showcased significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct educational experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a focus on recent research concerning settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes toward native Africans.\n\nA significant body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, predominantly in German and penned during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems' characteristics in these colonies. Subsequent English-language writings broadened the discussion through comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted substantial differences among the educational systems of the various colonies. A key work addressing this topic is Cohen's study, which contrasts the educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa and examines the factors contributing to their differences. Cohen attributes many distinctive features of South West Africa's educational system to its large settler population.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa experienced a relatively temperate climate, despite significant areas being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the colony with the next largest European population, East Africa, had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an illustration of two countries that once experienced a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War between 1846 and 1848, a conflict in which the United States emerged victorious, gaining control over Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, subsiding just before World War I. The roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental disagreements on issues like religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31).\n\nSuch rivalries are not uncommon among countries sharing borders. Nations with contiguous boundaries often experience conflicting interests that foster adversarial relations. The U.S. and Mexico exemplify this pattern of enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both countries are geographically proximate to the United States and have historically been its rivals, unlike many other Latin American nations that have generally maintained amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences contributed significantly to the friction between the United States and Mexico, echoing a challenge faced by many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, this tension involved both ideological differences and a contest over crucial national interests. However, in this instance, the ideological discord centered on religious orientations rather than political systems. The deep-seated distrust stemmed from historical tensions between the English and Spanish, with both nations inheriting these sentiments from their colonial pasts, posing a significant challenge to fostering positive diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry, primarily concerning territorial issues like border raids from Mexican territory into the U.S. and other frontier complications. Incursions by bandits and outlaws into American border towns posed a persistent problem until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109). It ultimately concluded as American objectives transitioned \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) toward the end of the 19th century.",
            "Around fifteen years back, an unexpected illness left me suddenly disabled, a condition I had never imagined. At that time, I was working as a nurse. I had chosen this career because it offered the stability and security that I had longed for during my childhood. Growing up, I frequently heard, \"You'll always find work; people will always need medical care,\" which guided my decision-making into adulthood. Although my aspirations leaned towards becoming a scientist or a journalist—ideally a combination of both—I pursued nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46 years old, I found myself single, with little financial security, and unable to work. Today, I am still living with this disability and, after 15 years relying on Social Security Disability benefits, I have virtually nothing to call my own. While I manage to get by, each day presents challenges to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite life's uncertainties, I know this much: I could not have endured all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. When true adversity hits, personal strength can feel insufficient.\n\nMy experience underscores that emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable. No amount of preparation can guarantee overcoming every obstacle alone. While I agree that we in the U.S. should not rely excessively on a faltering government, I believe it is more beneficial for Americans to relearn trust, to offer and seek help from one another, instead of isolating ourselves with individual survival plans.\n\nConservatives often celebrate the \"rugged individualism\" that they claim built this nation, but in reality, our ancestors weathered adversity through compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach their destinations by going solo.\n\nSo, certainly, prepare yourself. I have my own disaster kit, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows against potential biological threats. I have multiple flashlights, an assortment of batteries, along with a store of candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources to cultivate a small farm and preserve your own food, it's an excellent idea. A wood stove is also a wise investment—provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut in addition to these preparations, take the time to connect with your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would eventually be recognized as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he distanced himself from worldly affairs, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings laid the foundation for Buddhism. The most traditional form of Buddhism is known as Theravada Buddhism, and this religion has a history of about twenty-five centuries. Over time, its appearance and practices have evolved since the days of Buddha. For example, in Sri Lanka, a country where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, the annual water-cutting ceremony is an event that many participate in, both monks and laypeople, even though Buddha himself never mentioned such a celebration. These changes extend from surface-level traditions to the deeper spiritual essence of the religion. Both the monastic community and lay followers within Theravada Buddhism have had to adapt their beliefs over time due to various influences, whether from within or outside the religion, and whether those influences were supportive or antagonistic.\n\nThis discussion will frequently refer to several important terms. Internal forces are those arising from within the Buddhist community itself, including both monastics and lay followers. External forces originate from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that intend to harm or actually harm Buddhism, often driven by negative perceptions. Benign forces are neutral, neither intending to harm nor help, though they may inadvertently do either. These distinctions will be important throughout this examination.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Followers take refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (community). The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka addresses the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is essential for ending Samsara, the cycle of birth and death, along with the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for living; laypeople are expected to follow five precepts, including abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants, while monks adhere to a more extensive set of rules. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine are the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, or suffering; second, the truth that attachment leads to suffering; and third, the truth that suffering can be transcended."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In negotiations, the influence of culture is profound and multifaceted. Defining culture extends beyond its visible aspects to what it signifies and what it is not. It is not a monolith or a singular entity, nor does it conform to uniformity. Oversimplified statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are generalizations that can be misleading. While recognizing cultural stereotypes can be useful, it is far more beneficial for negotiators to grasp how a culture impacts the negotiation process and what implications it may hold. When encountering a different culture, one naturally perceives it through the lens of their own, prompting comparisons.\n\nGaining insight into a foreign culture or mindset might require exploring its history or understanding its biases. Instead of judging or attempting to alter a culture, it is crucial to accept it as it is and operate within its limits, particularly during negotiations, especially when one's negotiating position is weaker. Similarly, when a negotiator is on unfamiliar ground, respecting traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural obstacles and advance the negotiations.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that culture transcends national or international boundaries. Many companies within a nation cultivate their own unique corporate cultures. For example, a business might prioritize lengthy office hours or a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture is evident in aspects such as employee dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), and delegation of tasks. Some companies promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others restrict it to company-sanctioned charities or events. Observing variations in American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within the same company across different regions, from urban to suburban) highlights the diversity of perspectives within a societal culture. While some cultures might seem less stratified than American culture, appearing more homogeneous, this similarity merely prompts deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding cultural values is crucial as they explain the rationale behind a culture's behaviors. For instance, in cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success. Conversely, negotiators from cultures that emphasize hard bargaining may not rush to settle an agreement. Considering these general cultural tendencies is essential before entering negotiations. However, a negotiator benefits from learning about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This view is similarly shared by another thinker we will discuss, Thomas Aquinas. As both philosophers defend the same idea, our task is to determine which argument is more compelling. For the sake of brevity, let's assume they both correctly believe in the existence of the biblical God. Introducing a different concept of a deity would hinder a fair comparison of their arguments, as they defend a specific notion of God. Despite the strengths in their arguments, neither offers a complete foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo delve into this issue, let's first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes finding understanding through faith, suggesting that evidence of God can be discovered within oneself. He claims that since God is present within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Although Anselm's ideas can be complex and occasionally unclear, his main point is that the proof of God resides in our minds. He implies that we don't need external evidence to recognize the truth of God's existence, as it is something we inherently know. This concept of believing without conclusive empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas holds a different perspective. Aquinas argues that God's existence can be demonstrated purely through reason and empirical evidence, requiring no faith. This approach could aid evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, by attracting new converts without relying on their acceptance of the unprovable. Instead, they could be convinced through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: motion, causation, contingency, gradation, and design. Through these, he asserts that the logical necessity for God serves as proof of His existence. Just as one could infer the features of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic can reveal God's existence.",
            "Authors often employ various strategies to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers concerning significant themes. While some methods prove more effective than others, F. Scott Fitzgerald skillfully incorporates a range of these techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives with nouns in unconventional pairings to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to objects and employs them for a similar purpose. A notable example of this latter technique is his use of colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, with meaning, which he later utilizes to evoke a particular emotional response in relation to an important object.\n\nThe symbolism attached to white/gray is one of uniformity, with white suggesting a more refined and upper-class quality, whereas gray conveys an aged and faded impression. This symbolism is established early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8)—in fact, white clothing appears prevalent: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Interestingly, the only moment white is absent is when Nick observes Gatsby's party, noting that \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further cements the meanings of these colors by associating them with mundane, common subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby’s party attendees appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's list, and Catherine’s apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). Additionally, ordinary people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sufficiently established the meanings of white/gray, he uses these colors to represent insignificance or conformity in various subjects. This technique is notably applied to Daisy. After a period without significant mention of these colors, Daisy is suddenly depicted \"dressed in white\" and driving \"a little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more as a component of uniformity, an object of Gatsby's desire (74). Fitzgerald continues to employ this technique to reinforce the idea of Daisy as a uniform presence, as seen in descriptions like the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts a robust agricultural sector, largely attributed to its temperate and sunny weather. The region is known for cultivating a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A strong demand exists for organic, community-supported agriculture (CSA) products in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk enjoy considerable popularity as well. Many organic farms extend invitations for tours, offering insights into their farming operations, and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other leisure activities. Such ventures enable landowners to leverage government programs' advantages while enhancing habitat, thus facilitating recreational use and creating prospects for farm tours and educational programs.  \n  \nEngaging in organic farming not only caters to a potentially profitable niche market but also often results in enhanced biodiversity of local flora and fauna, owing to the absence of chemical use in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be costlier than traditional farming methods. It necessitates more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses compared to conventional methods. Small organic farms also miss out on the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. Practices that, while not directly linked to organic farming, benefit wildlife may also incur additional labor costs, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to cultivate specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Therefore, there are several reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profits and habitat quality.  \n  \nThe chosen land for this scenario is located near the town of Potrero, in the unincorporated area of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres, consisting of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. Situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the plan is under review and currently considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many of these are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are in decline and may soon be listed, like the burrowing owls.  \n  \nThis area has a rich history, having been home to Native Americans for countless generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The parcel of land was originally part of a homestead patent and likely utilized for grazing or wood production over the decades. I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and explored available government programs to assess what options a small farmer might have to mitigate costs and maintain wildlife-friendly operations. As a model for what someone farming this land might aim to accomplish, I identified an organic farm within the same vicinity.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, a lasting, unalterable bond. This connection encompasses a range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, more than anyone else connected by such a bond, seeing themselves in their sibling. In moments of crisis, this bond reveals its true nature, whether for better or worse. As these emotions surface, they come with significant consequences. Part of grasping the emotions stemming from this fraternal link involves navigating the outcomes they entail. When one gazes into a brother’s eyes and sees their own reflection, they perceive themselves not as others do, but as they truly are. Their true character is revealed through their actions and the repercussions of those actions. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and the tumultuous emotions it brings. Set against a richly detailed backdrop, these boys embark on a doomed journey. The story reaches a climax where bitter disappointment and intense pride collide, leaving only one brother alive. The theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, alongside the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview, both heavily influencing his behavior.  \nThe protagonist’s behavior is largely driven by a single emotion: pride. From the onset of their adventures to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother to whom he could impart his skills, such as \"...holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\" He envisioned a companion to race to Horsehead Landing and to perch with atop the great pine behind the barn. These dreams are thwarted by Doodle's frail condition. Born with a severely weak heart, Doodle's survival was uncertain, let alone his participation in strenuous activities. For the young protagonist, bursting with fanciful dreams, the reality was crushing. His frustration even led him to consider harming his brother by suffocating him with a pillow—a shocking thought for a child. Yet, a simple smile from Doodle softened his heart, offering the protagonist a glimmer of hope. This suggests that his resolve was not firm; deep down, he had an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has progressed from basic to advanced, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also evolved. In the beginning, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, later to a book, and now, to a computer. When studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have limitations and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms transform this sensory data repeatedly through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and the object's borders—where color changes abruptly—to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses decisions made during bottom-up processing to enhance your recognition of the box. In this case, top-down processing might help you recognize the object as a black box rather than a hole shaped like a box in the white background.\n\nAfter information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter evaluates the importance of the signal and decides which cognitive processes it should be directed to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, a functioning attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might notice your name even in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, and the outcomes are repeatedly influenced by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it first needs to store it. There are different types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with specific encoding types for each sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some arising from how people retrieve memories, others from computer science or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as nodes, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial downturn. This period saw rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and significant damage to some of America’s key corporations. The recession continues to affect us today, prompting a critical question: what caused this crisis, and what measures can prevent a recurrence? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from reckless and shortsighted political choices that compelled banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans within an already fragile financial system. Institutions like Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pushed to back and repackage these loans into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves, spreading the turmoil through the repackaged loans and affecting the broader economy. \n\nThe origins of this financial predicament trace back to 1999 during President Clinton's administration, as he sought to bolster his re-election chances by increasing his popularity. The administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis that unfolded seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes in the New York Times in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate-income individuals and felt the pressure from shareholders to sustain its impressive profit growth.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: “But the government-backed corporation could face trouble in an economic downturn, possibly necessitating a government bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.” As outlined earlier and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending practices led to the economic collapse.\n\nA confluence of factors sent the economy into a downward spiral, including the intricate structure of new mortgages. In the years preceding the crisis, adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used, linking more sectors of the economy to the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets overextending their investments in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nUltimately, the housing bubble burst, and financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered the consequences. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a collective $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing about 30% of the nation’s GDP. Consequently, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. It's that part of your narrative where you get to spread your creative wings and soar, dazzling everyone with your enchanting, almost magical writing. Or, it's the section where your readers lose interest and possibly exit your story, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin, for instance, is known to yell at her screen when she encounters an overload of information, not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition is not a writer's ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the classic advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin often finds herself entangled in lengthy passages where either nothing occurs, or too much happens. Exposition is that pesky little voice that tells you to breeze through the backstory to reach the more exciting parts (distinct from the voice that urges you to relay every detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about past events, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, this occurs when one character shares a wealth of information with another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, this responsibility falls on the author.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you're reading a story, you're informed that the heroine met her love at a specific place and time, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to be compressed into two pages, with both characters only exchanging a couple of lines each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, demonstrating through his dialogue and actions how profoundly he loves his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to express, in both subtle and significant ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if it's later stated explicitly in the story). Properly introducing the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and provide insights into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, and hints about her thoughts and dreams as mirrored through his perspective. You would mourn his loss alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate more substance beyond the basic plotline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, furnishing that substance is your task. (*glances at the metaphor, sighs, continues*) It's often tempting to skim over certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he's an ex-Air Force member, currently the night manager at a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys weekend fishing trips, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live segment on NBC 4 this morning, August 13, 2011. The leading story featured a man from Ashley, Ohio, named Shad Hostettler, who had stabbed his wife. They didn't reveal her name, but they did show his mug shot, which gave off a menacing impression. The story was brief, lasting only about two minutes since it was still unfolding. The details shared were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody. I felt the time spent on this story was adequate.\n\nThe second report focused on an early morning shooting involving 18-year-old Travis Buyers, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At the time, there were no arrests or suspects. The SWAT Team was conducting the investigation. This story seemed brief, and I suspect this might be because it involved a black man or occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. Over the years, I've noticed that crimes involving minorities as victims tend to receive less media attention. In contrast, if a white child or adult is abducted or harmed, the media coverage is extensive. However, if the victim is a minority, the incident is lucky to get even a mention.\n\nAnother story covered a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided on the suspected location of the incident. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle struck the helicopter, and Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the responsible individual.\n\nThe following report discussed the rain and thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low 80s over the weekend. The segment was relatively brief, likely used as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also included a story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. He was estimated to be about six feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. I found it unusual how much emphasis was placed on his race and complexion.\n\nAnother report detailed the case of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I'm not sure if this was meant to sound harsher or for another reason. They also noted that he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment security aimed at tracking indices, commodities, or collections of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. ETFs combine the diversification benefits typical of index funds with the individual stock advantages such as short selling, margin buying, and the option to buy as little as one share at a time. These attributes are appealing, particularly since ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. However, investing in ETFs requires paying a commission for trades, similar to stock transactions. One major advantage of ETFs is the wide range of funds available. Despite the clear advantages, it's prudent for investors to critically assess if these benefits, like diversification, are genuinely present and to what extent. To explore this, we will analyze the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF yields similar benefits to a diversified portfolio of these stocks, and to evaluate if alternative configurations of the same stocks might offer a better Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo streamline the evaluation of the ETF, focusing on every holding would be cumbersome, so we will consider only the top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Listed below are these top 10 holdings along with their percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks reflect the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current asset percentages, adjusted to 100%, to compute their contributions to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio comprised solely these 10 stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The Beta and return calculations are detailed in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it’s apparent that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. It’s also noted that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than that of the entire ETF. Based on these results, a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, there is a chance that the means of these two portfolios are not statistically different.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and adjusted to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In the third month of the project, as shown in Figure 17, there was a significant decline in the number of commuter log submissions, which was somewhat disappointing and difficult to fully understand. At a New England campus, winter leads to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, which could partially explain the decrease. December marks the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is occupied with completing assignments and finalizing grades. Logging commutes might have simply been overlooked during this period. Additionally, December is when the busy holiday season begins, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to be on campus. Classes start again in late January for the spring semester, which might also explain the low number of logs during that time. However, this does not account for the low submissions in February. It's possible that any project like this has an initial surge of enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counter this, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March to boost engagement, which led to an increase in log submissions. Thus, maintaining momentum was a challenge, particularly due to the natural decline in interest and the impact of holiday and semester breaks in academia. \n\nAnother hurdle for this project, as with any initiative promoting alternative commuting, is the preference for the freedom and convenience associated with driving. This is a deeply rooted cultural norm. Therefore, providing incentives is crucial to encourage alternative commuting. We offered a variety of prizes, such as gift certificates to local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local bookstore, and some larger chain stores. It would have been interesting to see how offering larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car, might have influenced participation. This could have also helped address the drop in engagement. The prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, if the value of the prizes had increased over time, it might have helped sustain interest. The gift cards were well-received at the project's start, but announcing the addition of a few bicycles in December, followed by a hybrid or electric car in January, might have boosted participation and engagement instead of seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all of the trick films, totaling fifteen between 1895 and 1901. These films typically utilize inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis mainly centered on detailing the poetics of the majority of these trick films and investigating the unique features evident in a few of the later ones. Generally, trick films at the century's turn are confined to a set, shot within a frontal proscenium, devoid of camera movement, employing long and medium shots, and adhering to a strict one shot equals one film approach. However, some films from the early 1900s venture beyond these boundaries by incorporating elements such as multiple shots. \n\nA prominent feature shared among trick films is their filming within an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, neither following figures nor objects. This static composition was prevalent in early films, rooted in theatrical traditions, and for trick films specifically, influenced by vaudeville and magic performances. A limitation of this stage-like setup is that characters typically move laterally, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the screen. Even as they exit the frame, the camera remains fixed.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also results in predominantly long shots and occasionally medium shots, with close-ups absent from Edison’s trick films. This reflects theatrical and vaudeville practices where audiences viewed the entire act within the stage's frame. Like most early films, actors do not advance from the middle ground towards the camera, hence the absence of close-ups.\n\nEarly trick films often adhere to the formula where one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This typically restricts the length of these films to about a minute or less, contingent on the frames per second. It also confines the narrative or dramatic scope of the trick films, which usually focus on brief vaudeville-like tricks—magic, vanishing, or switching acts—without much storyline. Importantly, in a trick film, a single conceptual shot perceived by the viewer does not necessarily equate to one physical shot. A \"shot\" might be several spliced together to create the illusion of appearance or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) for example, an early trick film. A closer look reveals the start of the physical shot featuring Mary’s severed \"head,\" although the entire film seems like one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "In his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as a paradoxical mix of \"Old-New.\" This literary style has faced criticism and praise alike, often being accused of lacking depth while simultaneously celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, the first \"Gothic Novel,\" masterfully blends elements from \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances, giving birth to the early Gothic style and a fresh form of literary expression. Walpole incorporates traditional theatrical components along with the 'modern' novel's natural mimicry, resulting in what he dubs \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently draws from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term used to describe various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or unrefined compared to contemporary societal and literary \"progress.\" The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's new format, which offers readers deeper psychological insights into the characters, has ensured the genre's longevity, making it simultaneously antiquated and fresh to readers far removed from its inception.\n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, the knight's training process, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Gothic authors, especially Walpole, valued chivalry for its representation of the ideal knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—qualities they perceived as lacking in their society. By incorporating chivalric ideals, the \"gothic past\" becomes romanticized, hinting at Gothic's future evolution into Romanticism, with the aim of bettering the present. Walpole, writing The Castle of Otranto during a politically tumultuous period, was disheartened by the potential future. Engulfed in politics and possibly unjust accusations, he may have believed that the inherent morality and \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era were absent in his contemporary society. This idea is evident in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric ideals. Before Frederic's introduction, he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic is portrayed with numerous classic chivalric attributes; he is primarily a prince, has endured suffering, has been deeply affected by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, introducing the Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of steps for transporting products from the customer's order through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and ultimately distribution to the consumer. The concept of supply chain management was first introduced by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. Oliver outlined the comprehensive task of planning, executing, and overseeing the supply chain operations to efficiently fulfill customer demands. This process comprises six crucial components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain is production, serving as the cornerstone of the entire process. During this phase, decisions are made regarding the timing, purpose, location, and method of production. Managers must understand what consumers desire, often relying on market analysis to gauge customer demands. Once managers have assessed market needs, they can determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities. Following this, decisions are made about the production site, selecting the plant that best balances volume and quality, while ensuring customer satisfaction is prioritized. After finalizing the production location, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. This stage is critical, as every detail plays a significant role, and poor planning can lead to costly delays. For example, when I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had detailed guidelines for all aspects of their operations, from employee uniforms to truck shipments, ensuring smooth operations without confusion.\n\nThe second essential aspect of supply chain management is supply. This involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core competencies and forming outsourcing partnerships based on these choices. A company might have multiple production units for a single product, each with distinct equipment, staff, and expertise. Managers must determine which unit is most suitable for different stages of the production process. They may also opt to outsource work to other companies to enhance efficiency. Outsourcing is often used to achieve velocity, which is the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Victorian literature often fascinates readers with its meticulous detail and its preoccupation with the era's upper classes. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while belonging to this period, diverge from these norms. These books introduce elements of mystery and the unconventional, which aren't typically seen in novels of this time, enhancing character depth by revealing their motivations and emotions.\n\n\"Suddenly, a barrage of perplexing and disorienting thoughts flooded his mind. It felt as though he was still walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were locked in a heated argument: their words echoed in his ears; and when he became aware of himself, … he realized he was speaking to them…. Abruptly, a gunshot rang out; cries and shouts erupted around him; lights flashed before his eyes amidst the chaos, as an unseen force whisked him away. Throughout these swift visions, there was a vague, uneasy awareness of pain, which continually exhausted and tormented him.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often incorporate mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike experiences, though their content and purpose differ in each context. In Oliver Twist, these strange episodes often provide insights into Oliver’s internal struggles, his suffering, and his understanding of the events around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it vividly, as if in a dream, while seeking help (see left). This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses so much that he does not notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away; he relives his despair, detached from the initial shock, as the pain becomes a constant companion linked more to fear than surprise. With Oliver being so overwhelmed, the question arises of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it certainly was not his own doing. This event reinforces the idea that Oliver has little control over his life, unable even to attempt to influence the outcome of events, even when in mortal danger. This selection implies a growing sense of defeat within Oliver, as if old Fagin has started to wear him down, forcing him to accept this despair, affecting his ability to react. Otherwise, one might assume that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for his own survival.\n\n\"The day passed by – day! There was no day; it vanished as soon as it arrived – and the night returned; a night so lengthy in its dreadful silence and yet so brief in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-aged students. My role was to assist them in subjects they found challenging, though my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in third or fourth grade, as he was having significant difficulties with reading. I quickly realized that something was amiss; his reading struggles were quite unusual. While he could pronounce some letters perfectly, he completely faltered with others, which was quite perplexing. Adrian was of Latino descent, yet he spoke English flawlessly. Our progress was slow until I met his mother one day while supervising a few students who hadn't gone on a field trip. She spoke only Spanish, and despite my limited Spanish skills as a beginner, we managed to communicate. At that moment, it became clear to me: Adrian could read, but his grasp of the English alphabet was shaky. I’m not sure if this realization significantly impacted his progress, but I sincerely hope he's doing well now.\n\nI'm sharing this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It also illustrates that such obstacles aren't always as evident as one might assume. Even a child who speaks perfect English can face significant challenges when it comes to reading it. It's widely acknowledged that this issue exists, but what steps can we take to address it? In Adrian's situation, the solution was straightforward: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no single solution. A combination of dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, stands out as an excellent approach, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs tend to outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns that such programs might be resource-intensive and offer limited benefits to most students, this is not the case. If these programs were standard practice rather than the exception, all children could gain from them. But how do we implement this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is neither feasible nor realistic. However, employing bilingual aides or tutors is certainly a practical solution.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea of something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some attend Sunday school to explore this concept, others go to Temple, or look within for answers. Many accept the religious beliefs passed down from their parents, while others reject these ideas, insisting there's nothing beyond our individual understanding. We might embrace one belief system only to later shift to another. Regardless of the path chosen, we embark on a journey to define our spirituality through our unique perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness to enlightenment.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our house's front porch, listening to the rain hitting the tin roof and smoking cigarettes together. The rainwater flowed from the gutters, overwhelming the plants along the porch's edge. My father gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed part searching, part reflective. Over the past months, he had become thinner, his clothes hanging loosely, his hair thinning more than I remembered. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt isolated, frightened, and unable to discuss how much I would miss him, as talking about it would make it all too real. I hugged him, returned to my seat, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the dim June evening.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father passed away. The chemo and radiation had not alleviated his suffering but had extended his life beyond the doctors' expectations; yet the benefit of prolonging his suffering remained elusive to me. I questioned what kind of God would allow such a thing. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If there was a God, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness his transition from this life to the next, so I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that gave me existence come to its end. I wanted to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone, and knew he wouldn't want his only child to be a mere observer at his death. I retreated into myself, curled up in bed for three days, awaiting the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for Republicanism in its early days. Primarily engaged in agriculture, Taylor's experiences in this field, coupled with a short stint in politics, shaped him into a figure known for his firm commitment and vocal stance on individual liberties and governance. His strong support for an agrarian lifestyle profoundly influenced his views on government issues. His dedication to sustaining what he viewed as the finest profession informed his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as having a unique chance to develop an ideal form of governance, unencumbered by existing traditions that might obstruct innovation. This allowed for the creation of a system focused on self-governance. He was a staunch believer in the inherent rights of individuals, asserting that these rights were interconnected; denying one would undermine them all, diminishing their overall value. Therefore, he argued that such rights should remain outside governmental interference. He suggested that in the so-called \"state of nature,\" individuals with physical strength and cunning intelligence thrived, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor argued that government must recognize the intrinsic good and evil within humanity. He held strong views on dualistic morality, asserting that since government is operated by people, it must inherently reflect human virtues and vices. He characterized good principles as those safeguarding private property, advancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. He believed a government rooted in sound principles would remain just, even if led by those driven by greed and self-interest. Taylor saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions but deemed it problematic only when it extended beyond fostering a society oriented toward the public good, creating smaller factions that thrived at others' expense. Thus, he concluded that a good government was essential to curb human nature's darker tendencies, requiring vigilant oversight to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many dedicated Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He championed a Federal government with very limited powers, restricted to those explicitly articulated in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government could be costly and prone to tyranny. However, he also warned that a simplistic, literal reading of the Constitution was risky; without considering the framers' intentions, such an approach could easily be corrupted. Moreover, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the United States' true foundational document, as it more clearly defined the nation as a coalition of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind processed the view in front of me with a detached clarity. I observed in silence, with a keen awareness that avoided connecting the scene to any deeper understanding, as my mind dissected the image before me. Thoughts flickered in and out of my consciousness so fluidly that it seemed as though I had no distinct thoughts of my own, only an uninterrupted experience of my surroundings. \n\nOn a recommendation from an artist I once collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since childhood, I had aspired to learn drawing, and this book offered insights from the basics of pencil use to the brain's methods for interpreting lines. A technique in the book suggested using a square frame to focus on a specific part of an image, simplifying a complex scene—like a bowl of fruit in a kitchen—into a manageable study of that single bowl. \n\nYet, at that moment, as I stared at the bowl before me, I couldn't impose that artist's frame. Overwhelmed and in awe, I could only stand and marvel. Just as Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists displayed vibrant palettes, I found myself at the beginning of what might be called my Work in Brown. \n\nI reached for my chosen tool of artistry, as muscles tensed and relaxed, guiding my hand through space. My will took shape in what might have been a peak of creativity. Water swirled, smooth and clear, as bits of material broke away and vanished. With muscles tensing and twitching slightly more urgently on the second attempt, my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown mass remained, stuck fast at the bottom of the bowl. \n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet braced apart, and a green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned at the unsightly mess—a remnant of processed food left as a message for the unfortunate cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, and I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it formed a makeshift glove. Standing straight, then bending over, my hand slowly descended into the water, much like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers in America face alarming risks on the road. Multiple elements contribute to the troubling statistics associated with teenage drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is that teens' brains aren't fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is another significant factor that not only leads to more fatal accidents but also increases incidents of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeenagers also tend to be more prone to accidents when they are driving with their peers, a common occurrence. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted research highlighting a link between the passenger's age and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, states like California have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours young drivers can be on the road and limit them from carrying other minors as passengers. However, I believe these provisional licenses are merely temporary fixes. Statistically, the youngest drivers are not prepared to manage the risks and responsibilities that come with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even argues that individuals under 18 are too immature for a standard driver's license. His research, cited by USA Today, indicates that those under 19-20 often seek thrills through risky behavior. Thus, delaying the driving age until this thrill-seeking tendency diminishes makes sense. Continuing to issue licenses to young teens could lead to even more deadly accidents, with the potential death toll escalating as more Baby Boomer children become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nAddressing this problem through legislation would be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver's education to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before granting a full license, with mandatory practical driving hours required. The number of required hours could align with what most states already mandate—California, for example, requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Given the nationwide scope of the teen driving problem, uniform national legislation would be a sensible and potentially effective way to safeguard teenagers across the country.\n\nThe legislative approach I'm advocating for isn't groundbreaking.",
            "This document explores three aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. It then delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or “red flags.” Lastly, it discusses strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to the central nervous system's (CNS) ability to process auditory information efficiently and effectively. In more specific terms, (C)AP involves the perceptual handling of auditory data within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing, leading to electrophysiological auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain struggles to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing capabilities and are not classified as “hearing impaired”; the difficulty lies in the brain’s ability to distinguish words or separate conversation from background noise, which does not function as expected.\n\nThe earliest reference to what is now known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, initially termed “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during the study of children with communication disorders. In 1954, the Italian research team comprising Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began devising tests for these children. By 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) that supports dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD presents in various forms: affected individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially; they might find it challenging to differentiate between multiple “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); they may be unable to identify sound patterns or detect changes in speech (such as recognizing sarcasm from vocal tone); subsequent sounds might obscure earlier ones; they may lack the ability to synthesize sound clues for meaningful interpretation and action; and they could have difficulty determining the sequence of auditory information presented (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,” which might be carried out by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using various measures that assess auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This process can include questionnaires and surveys, as well as observing auditory behaviors and responses to stimuli. Currently, no single tool or test is consistently successful for diagnosis, nor is there a known cause for the disorder. Many tests require the patient to differentiate between multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and evaluating the responses to those signals.",
            "Pursuing a career in social work, I aim to join the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and supporting families in distress. The values I bring to the field include service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to fostering better relationships among individuals, and a dedication to my own professional growth to maintain competence. These core principles are not only foundational to social work but are also deeply personal to me.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, though I was initially uncertain about the specific career path to pursue. During high school and college, I observed many people avoiding their issues or resorting to inadequate coping strategies. These observations influenced my decision to earn a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still unsure about my career direction, I took a break. That summer, a visit to a friend's house introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was there seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he had contacted the police about his situation. Wanting to assist, I went to his parents' home and shared my concerns with the police officers, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. The officers, unable to take legal action, asked me to speak with the parents. During our conversation, the parents appeared anxious and made excuses, labeling their son's actions as \"manipulative.\" This encounter prompted me to seriously consider a career in social work to address family conflicts that are often downplayed as \"simple.\"\n\nSocial justice is another essential value in social work. As a society, we claim to value each individual and mourn those we lose. Yet, the societal notion of \"individuality\" often aligns more with outdated traditions than true uniqueness. If society truly mourns lost individuals, why do we conform to be like \"everyone else?\" I embrace my individuality and resist conforming to societal norms. Throughout high school and college, I actively opposed social injustice: by expressing myself with unconventional hair colors, wearing clothes that matched my personality, getting multiple ear piercings, participating in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered them. I am committed to social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models as they relate to insomnia. The biological model examines genetic inheritance and health-related medical factors. Sociocultural models, on the other hand, consider environmental relationships and their connections to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia evaluates these models and discusses each research study selected to enhance understanding of the models. The research explanations and findings are then analyzed to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those related to another mental disorder, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while those connected to another mental disorder are associated with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorder categories may result from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia suggests challenges in staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or spontaneous REM. While Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, Parasomnias are linked to behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder include sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review concentrates on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model emphasizes genes, heritable components, and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a key role in sleep and wakefulness regulation. A study involving mice discovered that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons specifically influence sleep/wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep-inducing responses. Inhibiting its firing can lessen anxiety and encourage sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to extend sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that findings from animal models like mice can be applicable to human studies. This indicates a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or absence of this receptor might impair one's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any receptor alterations could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This can negatively affect aspects of life such as education, career, and daily activities requiring monotonous tasks and concentration.",
            "I've been attending University Park for roughly two and a half years now, spanning about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many, myself included. During my first year, I lived in a dorm in East Halls, practically at the eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. It would take me up to 25 minutes to walk from my residence at Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, which is centrally located, particularly when the weather was uncooperative—a frequent occurrence in State College. An alum I spoke with, not much older than me, mentioned that not too long ago, the East Halls were separated from the rest of the university by wide expanses of vacant land. Today, that space has been transformed into sports fields, large new buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus keeps growing, moving between locations becomes increasingly challenging. What’s the best way to handle mobility issues? On a college campus, it’s the bicycle. Yet, bikes alone won't solve the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently chatted with a friend who had taken up biking again after several years. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are fantastic. For a while, it wasn’t trendy to ride one, but it’s really the best way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for your health, biking is the most efficient travel method. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many students, I currently live off-campus, at a distance from the center equivalent to some dorms. Purchasing a bike has been my wisest choice this year. My classes are in the Thomas building, a brisk 25-minute walk from my residence. Biking can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my place, isn’t always easy to navigate, regardless of whether I'm biking or walking. While there are advantages to walking, I simply don't have the time. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable option for reaching class. Walking to Thomas daily would cost me an extra 30-40 minutes. That’s over two and a half hours each week, not counting the additional time required to walk to and from other classes and appointments. This is more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" there is a critical examination of the looming dangers posed by technological advancement and the capitalist framework that supports it, depicted through a dystopian society. Within this world, individuals prioritize the collective over personal identity and are programmed from birth to seek instant gratification as their ultimate goal. The inhabitants are depicted as mere pieces in a grand scheme, restricted to a singular ideology as enforced by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism about the growth of these systems. Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, underscores the notion that Huxley’s narrative critiques the economic structures emerging during his era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where ordinary citizens remain unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal benefits. This is attributed to the ideological domination of the working class, clearly illustrated by the conditioning seen in \"Brave New World.\" Lower classes like the Deltas and Gammas lack true autonomy; through sleep-teaching, the urge to consume, spend, and indulge is prioritized. As mentioned earlier, this is manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, or the complete dominance of social classes by a separate group, is evident here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, fully embracing an ideology that sustains such a structure, namely capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes are born aware but remain passive, with few exceptions like Bernard. The dynamics between social classes, explored in depth later, highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine connections between individuals are nonexistent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism strips away personal freedom and expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, with interactions remaining surface-level. This is shown through male characters' comments on women's physical traits and women's candid discussions about their experiences. Additionally, each class's acceptance of its hierarchical standing reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering fulfillment of their societal roles mirrors Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they remain obedient, consume, and conform.",
            "A few years back, I attended an Islam course at CBC, where one of the lively debates centered around whether Islam is inherently hostile. In today’s world, this question seems more pertinent than ever. Reflecting on the post-9/11 period, I've noticed a shift in media portrayal from viewing Islam and extremists with hostility to displaying significant tolerance towards Islam in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that someone with a name like Barack Obama, who has ties to Islam in his family's background, could become a presidential candidate.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography fascinates me because it appears to contrast with what I know about his history. Previously, I had the impression that Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam, conquering tribes and enforcing Islam upon them. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself, eventually attracting followers who recognized the truth in his teachings.\n\nInterestingly, the stories of Muhammad contain notable parallels with Jesus's ministry, particularly in instances like multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative approach suggests the writers aimed to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and performing miracles without needing to prove himself. This portrayal seems to diminish the significance of Jesus Christ's miracles and life, as if borrowing from Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also includes many tales that seem intended to show people willingly converting to Islam. However, these accounts often rely on third-hand sources, with the author recounting stories passed through several individuals. While intended to lend credibility, I felt this approach made the stories seem more dubious and less convincing.\n\nWhat unsettles me most about the biography is its effort to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure characterized by humility, wisdom, and gentleness. Yet, historical accounts challenge this depiction, and I wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings and beliefs of Jesus during his lifetime were quickly overshadowed as Christian thought evolved after his passing. Observing history broadly, one can notice Christianity gradually diverging from its original roots. In today's world, there is a growing consciousness and an unprecedented progressive tendency. Although traditionalists remain steadfast in their adherence to received teachings, they may not have a significant enough impact to sway the entirety of the population. Among Christians, there will be a substantial increase in historical awareness in the years to come. There will be a strong desire to differentiate between doctrines that were later incorporated into Christianity and the original intentions of its founder. This transformation could take decades or even centuries, but it seems inevitable: there will be a significant reversal in the trajectory of Christian history. The movement will aim to strip away layers of doctrine, as if turning back the hands of time, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced on behalf of God remains, untouched by later interpretations. As this trend makes its way through the United States and Europe, inspiring many to worship as if they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will remain robust to guide this change. However, as the theological timeline regresses, the present extensive diversity within Christianity will begin to revert to increased uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and various divisions, differences will give way to greater similarities. History is replete with notable reversions. For instance, Christians once faced persecution under the Roman Empire, which eventually became a Christian stronghold. Similarly, the United States transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversion will unfold within the Christian faith, unraveling history to reconnect with its origins, thereby reducing diversity in the process. A vital element enabling this shift will be an interpretive approach to Jesus' words, viewing them metaphorically rather than literally. But what transpired since Jesus' time? Delving deep into history, one finds Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures had become integral to the religion. The Jewish community was not unified, splitting into groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, alongside a majority of ordinary people.",
            "I am convinced that \"The Jungle\" reveals a fundamental aspect of human nature: an inherent inclination towards greed and self-interest. People tend to prioritize their own welfare and strive to enhance their own lives, often neglecting the needs of those less fortunate. This theme is evident throughout \"The Jungle,\" particularly through the depiction of factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their enterprises and achieving success, with little regard for any obstacles or harm their progress might cause. Upton Sinclair's narrative illustrates this through vivid imagery, such as when he describes the stark outlines of buildings against the sky and the relentless stream of smoke from towering chimneys, symbolizing the environmental damage and disregard for the wellbeing of others. The owners show no concern for the aftermath of pollution or the runoff from animal pens that contaminates the surroundings of Packingtown.\n\nEqually disturbing is the indifference shown by these managers and owners towards their workforce, who toil to increase their wealth. Driven by the desire to maximize profits, they exploit their employees mercilessly, as illustrated in the text: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long, grueling hours and face sudden layoffs without notice, severance, or assistance in finding new employment. Set during a time when labor laws and worker protections were virtually nonexistent, \"The Jungle\" exposes how managers and owners could push their workers to the brink, forcing them to endure hazardous conditions. Although the novel does not explicitly state it, it is clear that those who lived and labored in Packingtown were expected to endure appalling conditions both at work and in their daily lives. There were no support systems or resources available to assist the working class. While unions existed, they often exploited workers rather than aiding them, profiting from their plight. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe once described \"Dream-Land\" as one of his superior poems. Within this work, Poe mentions \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a term that Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil used it to describe an island located north of Britain, perceived by the Greeks as the world's edge. While Virgil indeed employed this term, a more recent influence deserves recognition. Poe had a keen interest in German authors. This connection is significant as it highlights Poe's awareness of Goethe's writings. In his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt discusses the resemblance between their poems, suggesting Poe drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" notes that Goethe was a renowned author of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year Goethe passed away. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after his wife's death, receives a goblet from her and subsequently succumbs to heavy drinking, mourning her loss. Eventually, he decides to part with his possessions, except for the goblet, and throws it into the sea from a cliff before closing his eyes and dying. The king's character in \"The King of Thule\" mirrors the somber tone found in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Additionally, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works. He refers to \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses the phrase twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's bleak, lonely landscape, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color. These scenes echo \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe, where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his will to live or rule. The poem seems to depict a journey into the world of Goethe's work. Goethe was a prominent writer whom Poe would have known, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe expressed his appreciation for Tennyson, and through this connection, he would have encountered Goethe's work, widely reproduced after its initial publication.",
            "Under California law, is it possible for a customer who was injured after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to be granted punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was notified about the spill twice and neglected to have it cleaned up for half an hour due to eating dinner? A judge is unlikely to swiftly dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To justify a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm that could result, and also demonstrate that the behavior was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin should have foreseen the potential harm from not promptly addressing a spill, considering that multiple D&D customers had slipped in the months before Palmer's incident; despite this, he neglected to clean the spill. While Palmer's argument that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it remains reasonable given that six slip-and-fall accidents occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to implement measures to ensure store safety. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin, on his dinner break, dismissed the report, stating he didn't have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, who again dismissed it. At 5:30 pm that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, sustaining a severe back injury. Before her accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents were reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and the decision is being made on whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" as per Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined in the statute as conduct intended to cause harm or, if not intentional, conduct that is \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as noted in id. at § (c)(1). Courts have described conduct as malicious when it involves a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From an early age, she felt an unyielding need for something she couldn't quite define. This longing began when she was around 14, just stepping into her teenage years, and it lingered as she turned 17. Over time, she realized it was a someone she sought, not a something. Despite this realization, no boys sparked her interest. Some tried to capture her attention with awkward charm, but none succeeded. She often pondered this peculiar absence of attraction, wondering what might be causing such a phenomenon in a teenage girl. Years of reflection led to theories, yet none were convincing enough to satisfy her curiosity. Thus, she continued her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents were mild-mannered and rarely disagreed, even with her. The only discord arose when she asserted her independence, expressing her vibrant personality, which contrasted with their calm demeanor. Despite this, her lively nature made her quite endearing to those around her.\n\nHowever, today was different. As she wandered through the house seeking inspiration, a sudden cry from the kitchen, her mother's familiar voice, broke the tranquility. Rushing in, her heart raced as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing and gasping, repeatedly uttering \"Ow.\" Instinctively, she knelt beside her, offering comfort. \"Ouch... darling, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother managed to say through labored breaths. Sensing her mother’s severe pain, she quickly responded, \"Alright Mom, just tell me where to carry you.\" Following her mother's guidance, she was thankful for her strength, honed by classes, as she carefully lifted her mother into the car, laid her in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital greeted them with the familiar mix of disinfectant, illness, and anxiety. Yet, her thoughts were solely on her mother. She swiftly brought her into the building, calling loudly for medical assistance. Faces filled with concern surrounded them, and soon a rolling bed was provided to lay her mother on. As they wheeled her mother away for immediate care, she was left to wait, anxiety mounting.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a step stool while reaching for a vase on the top shelf.",
            "The purpose of this research was to illustrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with a diminished chance of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as a lower risk of death from stroke. The aMed diet is an adjusted form of the Med diet, emphasizing increased intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (over saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. A moderate amount of alcohol is also permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and an intervention trial demonstrated that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in obese individuals. However, earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study—a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states—were followed. From 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of nurses remained in the study throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation processes. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by reviewing medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were labeled \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions categorized this way. For each FFQ, body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two previous years). Adjustments for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) were made by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the link between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and types of stroke.\n\nA stronger commitment to the Mediterranean diet, shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and strokes in women. Over a 20-year follow-up, there were 2,391 new cases of CHD, 1,763 new cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign boldly declares that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nStanding alone on a street corner, Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a piece of cardboard aloft, with this startling message scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, also recognized as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d’état. In 2007, the country witnessed a series of street protests, marking the first such public demonstrations in a decade. Spearheaded by numerous Burmese monks, these protests came to be known as “The Saffron Revolution,” named after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the public began to take notice after the early uprisings, and although the Burmese government initially permitted the monks to gather peacefully, the situation soon escalated into what many viewed as a full-scale conflict between the monks and the military junta. The military actively invaded and plundered monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned on sight, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27th, 2007, merely for attending a street protest. While official figures state that 13 people were killed, a defected army officer, Colonel Hla Win, reported, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nSuch events are not unprecedented. These examples of atrocities are among the most recent, yet the desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens is as old as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their absolute rule over society. Japanese emperors were believed to be gods themselves, sent to guide their people to prosperity, and our then-president, George W. Bush, reportedly held regular conference calls with Ted Haggard, head of Stupid People Worldwide, an affiliate of the Republic Party.\n\nNotable instances of such governmental actions include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4th, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule. The death toll in this protest varies widely, with Chinese government reports citing 200-300 fatalities, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another instance is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, with government support, systematically exterminated Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of their ethnicity. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ is another extreme case, where people of Jewish descent were systematically rounded up and killed over several years and across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is significantly attributed to his long-lasting career and his ability to mold his orchestra creatively. While Ellington's piano presence may be understated in many of the pieces chosen for this discussion, his prowess as a composer is evident through his ability to craft intricate and rich compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington designed an environment where soloists could improvise freely, alongside composing tightly orchestrated segments that utilized the distinct styles of his musicians to bring forth musical concepts. This approach not only emphasized the orchestra's overall tone but also allowed the creation of unique and cohesive sounds tailored to each composition. Ellington's understanding of individual musicians' sounds and how they contributed to the ensemble's growth enabled him to compose some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history. According to the Grove Music dictionary, Ellington's sound and pioneering spirit is exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he utilized the voice as a jazz instrument, a technique he employed throughout his career. This early instance of using voice to add texture and color without lyrics is also a testament to his ability to enhance the soloists' styles, a characteristic prevalent throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, as follows: Chorus 1 introduces a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth and melodic voice, which turns rougher towards the end. Chorus 2 features a muted trumpet solo elaborating on the melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. In Chorus 3, a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register is complemented by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band echoing the first chorus with a call and response between brass and reed sections. Chorus 5, the piece's climactic moment, has the reeds initiating the call and response in a high register, backed by a syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. Chorus 6 returns to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique as an instrument. The tag features a brief vocal run followed by a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone. Ellington's use of voice to infuse tone color into this piece is a hallmark of his style that permeates his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his talent for tight orchestration with his keen sense of tone color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing interweaves Miley's vocal-like trumpet play with Cox's instrumental voice, creating a rich and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key figure in his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone to great effect.",
            "What drives the evolutionary patterns observed in organisms? Are there certain limitations or influences that steer their evolutionary paths? Despite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" this statement still holds true today. In recent times, mathematical models have been used to explore general aspects of mollusk shell formation, both through individual development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to use mathematical modeling, alongside experimental studies, to shed light on the processes that determine the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes in Prunum. We utilized X-ray images of different Prunum species to identify measurable parameters that were then used for modeling both theoretical and real shell shapes. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995), allowing us to create hypothetical shell forms that helped define the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. The findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to enhance the understanding of significant evolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be compared to a structure that progresses over time through a full circle in space. The rotations or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central line. This line runs through the shell's central column, termed the columella. The growth rate of the whorls can differ, and a continuous line, called a suture, marks the boundary of each whorl. In most cases, the largest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the final one. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"typical\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nA method for counting whorls is outlined below. Initially, the shell should be viewed from the apical perspective to identify where the first suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two segments. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. It's possible to trace the aperture's path using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented both graphically and mathematically. After establishing a mathematical model, it's feasible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s process of shell formation.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has seen little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the nation is making progress in achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health are insufficient to reach their targets by 2015. The underlying causes of these deficiencies suggest a need to enhance the overall health system rather than just implementing specific programs.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by a skilled health professional, with 72% of births now falling into this category. However, this statistic includes traditional practitioners like midwives who are unable to perform medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high percentage of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, the improvements in this area are somewhat misleading, and significant work remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea who receive treatment from a healthcare provider. Although data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is evident that this is also a concern, with low service rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%. This figure highlights another issue: the disparity in healthcare access. While cesarean section rates are 7% in urban areas, they drop to only 2% in rural regions, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Access is primarily concentrated in urban locales. Furthermore, a 27% gap exists in healthcare utilization between the poorest and wealthiest segments of the population, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing services, likely due to prohibitive out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering how to enhance neonatal and maternal care metrics, the fundamental question is whether to adopt program-specific strategies or to bolster the health system as a whole, without particular emphasis on maternal and child care before and after pregnancy. Programmatic approaches are tempting because they offer focused, manageable goals and can yield quicker results. However, there are significant drawbacks. Prioritizing one area of the health sector can lead to reduced funding for others, and human resources may gravitate towards the well-funded area (as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting family planning). Additionally, running multiple independent programs for a single issue can lead to service duplication and a lack of coordination, resulting in increased paperwork for resources and funding.",
            "Over the last century, the realm of Popular Music has expanded to encompass an incredible variety of genres, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list. To add to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, among others—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even more specific sub-sub-genres. Within this sprawling landscape, Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres in popular music over the past four decades. This genre is expressive because it captures a wide array of emotions, though it often gravitates towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum. Its diversity became apparent not long after its inception, as musicians recognized its inherent flexibility and began to craft their own sub-genres, which in turn led to the creation of sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal genre has evolved to such an extent that it encompasses numerous niche groups, making it difficult to define what constitutes heavy metal. It has integrated elements from various other genres, yet, like all genres, it originated from a specific source. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend the essence of the metal movement and understand why it is considered a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. Metal musicians possess remarkable technical skills, evident in their command of their instruments. Unsurprisingly, the movement has also been significantly influenced by drug use. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly wild and fantastical recordings, with drugs often cited as a catalyst for these creations. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, as much of popular music at the time lacked such an exploration of the darker side of emotions. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the intense, visceral elements prevalent during the Romantic Era. For instance, lyrics from the song \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles highlight the movement's darkness. This particular track reflects themes of volatility, often attributed to drug influence. It is regarded by some as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a Rolling Stones song that also embraced heavier, darker themes. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' weighty sound, leading to the inclusion of this track on The White Album.",
            "In the years leading up to the emergence of Surrealism, Henri Rousseau was already engaged in the pursuit of his own artistic vision, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is emblematic of this journey. The artwork not only depicts a woman marveling at the surreal landscapes of her dreams but also embodies Rousseau’s aspirations and struggles as an artist. From the outset, he yearned for recognition and acclaim from his peers and art enthusiasts, confronting an internal conflict in the process. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau’s lifelong challenge: to either emulate popular artistic styles to gain acceptance in the art world or to forge his own path with creative independence.\n\nUnderstanding The Dream requires a glance at Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith who enjoyed middle-class comfort. Deprived of formal art education, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until he was forty, although he was mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector. The death of his first wife, Clémence, along with the loss of eight infant children, left him with a daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow. Seeking solace, he turned to painting, a new beginning that offered him refuge. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasantry in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, embodying the dreams and aspirations common to his social class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance within the art community is understandable given his circumstances. Lacking formal training and starting his career later in life, he was creating art alongside more established modern artists. Recognition for his work came late, coinciding with the rise of Matisse as an artist. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon contrasts the two, noting that while Matisse feared falling into artistic clichés, Rousseau aimed to paint in a conventional manner to gain entry into the Artiste Français. Despite being competitors, their motivations and styles diverged significantly.",
            "Throughout history, many influential thinkers have explored the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, as well as between truth and beauty. I am convinced that there is an underlying reason for this connection. John Keats captures this idea in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" where he famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding is acquired through education or personal experiences. Nevertheless, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems innate, as Keats suggests, without traditional instruction. Both fields endeavor to describe rather than dictate. Our analyses of morality and beauty primarily aim to explain why a piece of art or literature is appealing or why an action is ethical, rather than offer a set of rules for determining or producing good art or moral conduct.\n\nMoreover, critiques of art or morality can never fully encapsulate what makes something good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural significance, yet these elements alone do not define its artistic merit. Often, when asked about a preferred work of art or literature, people respond with something akin to, \"There's just something about it,\" before diving into a more detailed critique. I maintain that art and morals cannot be entirely distilled into a list of attributes. Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a piece of literature, an indescribable quality remains. I argue that ethics shares this characteristic. As Wittgenstein posits, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this ineffable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that the close relationship between morality and art arises from the profound way we experience them at a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. They affect us in a manner that is felt but not entirely articulated. This connection is particularly pronounced in the art of literature. According to McKean, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Today's Germany stands as a formidable and unified nation, characterized by a rich tapestry of culture stretching from the alpine region of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This cultural essence extends from Cologne along the Rhine River, through Germany's central areas, to Dresden on the Elbe River. Given its distinct culture, it's no surprise that modern Germany has evolved from a diverse mix of sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania, though the etymology of the name is a subject of considerable debate among scholars and historians. The Roman historian Tacitus suggested that it originated with the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, who were called Germans after crossing the Rhine to confront the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to document the term \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he described his conflicts with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls and used it to differentiate between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germans, whom he had not. Some speculate that the name might have meant \"neighbor\" in the Gaulish language. In the initial chapter of his first book on these wars, Caesar remarked: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war...They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Other theories suggest that \"German\" might derive from the spear they wielded, called a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” which could imply that the Germans were boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nTacitus, in his work “De Origine et situ Germanorum” from AD 98, chronicled the origins of the Germans, observing: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would choose Germania over Rome? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, but ultimately, they mostly returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they settled along the Roman Empire's borders, trading goods from their land and offering their expertise by enlisting in the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Shakespeare's play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, eventually a person must abandon their assumed identity, or risk losing their true self. A significant challenge in ending such deception is the potential for alienation. Ultimately, one must choose between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. While some may react indifferently upon learning they've been deceived, others may feel deeply offended by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of deception, particularly in the context of gender role reversal, brings forth numerous issues, with a central question being the motivation behind adopting a disguise of the opposite gender. For Viola, this shift is a protective measure: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola decides to pose as a man to safeguard herself. Her plan succeeds, but it isolates her from the women around her, severing an essential support network. Complicating matters, Viola is so adept in her masculine guise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian, developing romantic feelings for her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own suppressed feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary audiences, \"Twelfth Night\" may illustrate how deception can uncover hidden emotions, notably in Olivia and Orsino's cases. The play hints that these characters might have unspoken desires that Viola's presence compels them to confront. Is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of a perceived male identity, or does she harbor deeper feelings for women? Likely, this is not the case, as Olivia's character seems to satirize those who judge others solely by appearance. This is evident in how easily Olivia's affections shift from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually viewing Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often characterized by its harshness, particularly highlighted by the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, the complexities of an entire colonial empire cannot be encapsulated in such a straightforward manner. The German colonial empire demonstrated a wide range of policies and governance styles, as diverse as its geographical expanse. Similarly, educational systems across these colonies were not uniform. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (now Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories received commendation from authors of the era.\n\nConversely, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was quite different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established state schools and significantly contributed to native education, in South West Africa, this responsibility was largely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government backing. Nevertheless, the government allocated considerable resources for the education of Europeans in the colony, creating state schools and providing more substantial support and regulation to missionary schools. These educational strategies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies proudly showcased significant numbers of educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the distinct educational experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a focus on recent research concerning settlers' and colonial authorities' attitudes toward native Africans.\n\nA significant body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, predominantly in German and penned during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems' characteristics in these colonies. Subsequent English-language writings broadened the discussion through comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted substantial differences among the educational systems of the various colonies. A key work addressing this topic is Cohen's study, which contrasts the educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa and examines the factors contributing to their differences. Cohen attributes many distinctive features of South West Africa's educational system to its large settler population.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonies, South West Africa experienced a relatively temperate climate, despite significant areas being arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the colony with the next largest European population, East Africa, had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an illustration of two countries that once experienced a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War between 1846 and 1848, a conflict in which the United States emerged victorious, gaining control over Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, subsiding just before World War I. The roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental disagreements on issues like religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31).\n\nSuch rivalries are not uncommon among countries sharing borders. Nations with contiguous boundaries often experience conflicting interests that foster adversarial relations. The U.S. and Mexico exemplify this pattern of enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. According to David M. Pletcher (1977), \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both countries are geographically proximate to the United States and have historically been its rivals, unlike many other Latin American nations that have generally maintained amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences contributed significantly to the friction between the United States and Mexico, echoing a challenge faced by many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, this tension involved both ideological differences and a contest over crucial national interests. However, in this instance, the ideological discord centered on religious orientations rather than political systems. The deep-seated distrust stemmed from historical tensions between the English and Spanish, with both nations inheriting these sentiments from their colonial pasts, posing a significant challenge to fostering positive diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry, primarily concerning territorial issues like border raids from Mexican territory into the U.S. and other frontier complications. Incursions by bandits and outlaws into American border towns posed a persistent problem until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109). It ultimately concluded as American objectives transitioned \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) toward the end of the 19th century.",
            "Around fifteen years back, an unexpected illness left me suddenly disabled, a condition I had never imagined. At that time, I was working as a nurse. I had chosen this career because it offered the stability and security that I had longed for during my childhood. Growing up, I frequently heard, \"You'll always find work; people will always need medical care,\" which guided my decision-making into adulthood. Although my aspirations leaned towards becoming a scientist or a journalist—ideally a combination of both—I pursued nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46 years old, I found myself single, with little financial security, and unable to work. Today, I am still living with this disability and, after 15 years relying on Social Security Disability benefits, I have virtually nothing to call my own. While I manage to get by, each day presents challenges to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite life's uncertainties, I know this much: I could not have endured all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends. When true adversity hits, personal strength can feel insufficient.\n\nMy experience underscores that emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable. No amount of preparation can guarantee overcoming every obstacle alone. While I agree that we in the U.S. should not rely excessively on a faltering government, I believe it is more beneficial for Americans to relearn trust, to offer and seek help from one another, instead of isolating ourselves with individual survival plans.\n\nConservatives often celebrate the \"rugged individualism\" that they claim built this nation, but in reality, our ancestors weathered adversity through compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't reach their destinations by going solo.\n\nSo, certainly, prepare yourself. I have my own disaster kit, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows against potential biological threats. I have multiple flashlights, an assortment of batteries, along with a store of candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources to cultivate a small farm and preserve your own food, it's an excellent idea. A wood stove is also a wise investment—provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut in addition to these preparations, take the time to connect with your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would eventually be recognized as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he distanced himself from worldly affairs, achieved enlightenment, and his teachings laid the foundation for Buddhism. The most traditional form of Buddhism is known as Theravada Buddhism, and this religion has a history of about twenty-five centuries. Over time, its appearance and practices have evolved since the days of Buddha. For example, in Sri Lanka, a country where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent, the annual water-cutting ceremony is an event that many participate in, both monks and laypeople, even though Buddha himself never mentioned such a celebration. These changes extend from surface-level traditions to the deeper spiritual essence of the religion. Both the monastic community and lay followers within Theravada Buddhism have had to adapt their beliefs over time due to various influences, whether from within or outside the religion, and whether those influences were supportive or antagonistic.\n\nThis discussion will frequently refer to several important terms. Internal forces are those arising from within the Buddhist community itself, including both monastics and lay followers. External forces originate from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that intend to harm or actually harm Buddhism, often driven by negative perceptions. Benign forces are neutral, neither intending to harm nor help, though they may inadvertently do either. These distinctions will be important throughout this examination.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the foundational doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Followers take refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (community). The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the discourses, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka addresses the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. Key metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these principles is essential for ending Samsara, the cycle of birth and death, along with the cessation of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for living; laypeople are expected to follow five precepts, including abstaining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants, while monks adhere to a more extensive set of rules. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine are the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, or suffering; second, the truth that attachment leads to suffering; and third, the truth that suffering can be transcended."
