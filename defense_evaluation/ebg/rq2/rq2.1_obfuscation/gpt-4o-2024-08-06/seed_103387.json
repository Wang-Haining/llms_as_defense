            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by cultural factors. Culture isn't just defined by what it is, but also by what it isn't, and what it represents. It's not a monolithic or singular entity, and it's certainly not uniform. Broad statements like \"Russians are always stubborn\" or \"Japanese people are invariably accommodating\" are overly simplistic and fail to capture the complexity of cultures. Understanding cultural generalizations can be useful, but it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the importance of culture in the context of the negotiation and how cultural attitudes can impact discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, people naturally make comparisons to their own culture.\n\nUnderstanding a different culture or mindset may involve exploring its history and acknowledging its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, one should accept it and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, especially when one's bargaining position is weaker. If negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance discussions.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture doesn't only apply to national or international contexts. Companies often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, some prioritize long work hours, while others opt for more flexible schedules. Corporate culture can manifest in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others limit it to company-approved initiatives. The diversity of American corporate culture, varying from one company to another and even within regions of the same company, illustrates the range of perspectives within a societal culture. Other cultures might seem less stratified and more uniform to outsiders, but this exterior similarity invites a deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial because they explain the motivations behind a culture. For instance, in cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superiors. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle. Considering these general characteristics is vital before entering negotiations. However, it's also beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and sets the stage for St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This idea also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we'll explore. Both philosophers defend the same concept, prompting us to evaluate which argument is more compelling. For the sake of brevity and focus, let's assume that they both accurately believe in the existence of the Biblical God. Introducing a different concept of a deity would derail a proper comparison of their arguments, which are centered around a specific notion of God. Despite the merit in their points, neither philosopher offers a comprehensive justification for belief in God.\n\nTo delve into this, we begin by examining St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God can be found internally. He posits that since God exists within our understanding, it is impossible to truly conceive of His nonexistence. Although his explanation can be intricate and occasionally ambiguous, the essence is that the evidence for God resides in our minds. Anselm implies that truth about God is inherently known within us, rendering external evidence unnecessary. This notion of accepting what lacks undeniable empirical evidence is often termed faith in Christian literature.\n\nContrastingly, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be established purely through reason and empirical evidence, without any reliance on faith. This perspective is advantageous for evangelism, a significant aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of individuals solely through logical persuasion. Aquinas outlines five logical proofs for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through these, he illustrates that the necessity of God can be demonstrated logically. Just as one can infer the characteristics and existence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, Aquinas argues that logic alone can reveal God's existence.",
            "Authors frequently employ various techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers towards significant topics. These techniques can vary in their effectiveness. In his novel, \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these methods. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he imbues symbols with meaning and uses them for similar effects. One particular method he employs involves the use of colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, later using these associations to evoke certain feelings related to important objects or themes.\n\nThe associations Fitzgerald creates with the colors white/gray symbolize uniformity, with white connoting a sense of elegance and higher social standing, while gray suggests age and fading. This symbolism is established early in the novel through frequent references to these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted as being \"in white\" (8)—a color choice that extends to various characters and settings: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). A notable deviation from this is observed during Gatsby's party when \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines the meanings of these colors by applying them to mundane or commonplace subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the attendees of Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a metaphor for uniformity (28). Additionally, ordinary people or places are often described using white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes is populated with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), a child on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to denote unimportance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period with little mention of these colors, Daisy is depicted as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her less as a unique character and more as a standardized element that Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues to apply this technique in relation to Daisy, reinforcing the impression of her as a uniform presence. For instance, there is mention of the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and she wears a \"white\" (115) dress prior to the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County thrives in agricultural productivity, largely due to its mild and sunny climate. The region is known for producing a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is significant in San Diego, with many local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk also enjoy popularity. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations, along with recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. These farms present an opportunity for landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use and educational farm tours that can generate revenue.\n\nWhile organic farming can fill a profitable niche, it also contributes to increased biodiversity in the area by avoiding chemical use, which benefits both plants and wildlife. However, organic farming can incur higher costs compared to conventional farming due to its labor-intensive nature. This includes managing pests and weeds without chemicals and fertilizing the soil naturally. Losses can be greater, and small organic farms lack the economies of scale that larger operations have. Additionally, practices beneficial to wildlife but not directly related to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth, may result in increased labor costs. These are some of the reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Although still under review, the plan currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, such as burrowing owls, are declining and may be listed soon.\n\nThis land has a history of being inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the years. To explore the options available to a small farmer for cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly operations, I chose a property from a real estate website and researched potential government programs. I identified an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound and enduring, marked by a spectrum of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other in ways that no one else can, seeing a part of themselves reflected in their sibling. It's during moments of crisis that the true essence of this bond is revealed, for better or worse, accompanied by significant consequences. A deep understanding of these emotions involves grappling with the outcomes they produce. When a brother meets his sibling's gaze and sees a reflection of himself, he perceives his true nature, beyond what others see. It is through actions and their repercussions that one's true character is unveiled. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored by two brothers, accompanied by the tumultuous emotions it evokes. Against a backdrop of vividly depicted scenery, the boys embark on a journey destined for failure. This journey culminates in a scene where bitter disappointment collides with overwhelming pride, leaving only one brother surviving. The theme unfolds through direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of his environment.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From his initial outings with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother he could teach skills such as holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines at Old Woman Swamp. He envisioned a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or sit with him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, given Doodle's fragile heart condition, these dreams were unattainable. Doodle's survival was uncertain from birth, and participation in intense physical activities was nearly impossible. For the protagonist, brimming with youthful fantasies, the realization of these limitations was devastating. At one point, he even contemplates ending Doodle's life by smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would entertain such a thought? Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that fills him with hope, indicating that his resolve was not as strong as it seemed. Deep down, there was an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from its earliest forms to the state-of-the-art advancements we see today, the metaphors used to describe the brain have similarly progressed. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and finally, a computer. While studying the brain, it's crucial to recognize that these metaphors have their limits and may lead us to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory data undergoes continuous transformation through the brain's algorithms using both bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when observing a picture of a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing gathers basic details like color, orientation, and edge detection—where color shifts markedly over a small area—to conclude that a box is present. Top-down processing then leverages decisions from earlier bottom-up steps to expedite recognition of the box. In this scenario, top-down processing might assist in identifying the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped gap in the white field.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter assesses its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. For example, though your brain processes every blade of grass as you glance at your shoes, an effective attention filter stops you from noticing each one separately. Conversely, you might notice your name being spoken even amidst a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, with attention repeatedly shaping the outcomes.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it needs to be stored. Memory is categorized into sensory, working, and long-term types. Initially, information is encoded, and there are encoding methods specific to each sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on structure, which pertains to the appearance of a printed word, phonemically, which relates to the sound of the word, or semantically, which involves the word's meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by electrical signals cycling through a specific series of neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained within the structure of certain proteins.\n\nVarious models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are derived from how humans retrieve memories, others from computer science, and some from neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interlinked based on their relationships. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which could link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial crisis that led to a significant rise in unemployment, a collapse in the housing market, and left many major corporations in disarray. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from shortsighted and reckless political decisions that compelled banks and financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an underdeveloped financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex financial products like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves lacking sufficient capital reserves, spreading turmoil through the repackaged mortgages they had sold and affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought re-election by boosting his popularity. In pursuit of this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, which contributed to the conditions for the subprime crisis that emerged seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the administration to expand loan access to low and moderate-income individuals, while also being pressed by shareholders to sustain its impressive profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As outlined earlier and as Holmes anticipated, poorly conceived lending practices inevitably led to economic collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the intricate nature of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were extensively utilized in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets becoming heavily leveraged in real estate, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert into commercial banks under strict regulatory oversight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your tale where you spread your creative wings and soar, captivating everyone with your enchanting, if not mesmerizing, prose. Or perhaps it's the moment where your audience drifts off or clicks away, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she finds herself drowning in an overload of details, and not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition can be a tricky companion.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the classic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself lost in sprawling text where nothing unfolds, or worse, everything does. Exposition is the mischievous little voice that insists on getting the backstory out of the way to reach the exciting parts (not to be mixed up with the other voice demanding the author share every tiny detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, exposition occurs when a character delivers a lengthy monologue of information like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In novels, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her love at a specific time and place, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span only two pages, with both characters speaking just a couple of lines each. You would anticipate the author to delve into the husband's personality, illustrating through his words and actions how deeply he cherishes his wife, and expect the heroine to demonstrate in various ways how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this was true). A well-crafted introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and offer insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their connection, and hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his loss with her, thereby strengthening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance on the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your task to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues on*) There is often a temptation to gloss over certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he once served in the Air Force, now works as a night manager at a gas station, has been married twice without children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which aired live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The leading story focused on a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Although his wife's name wasn't mentioned, his mugshot was shown, and he appeared quite menacing. As the story was still unfolding, they only spent about two minutes on it, mentioning that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I felt that they dedicated an appropriate amount of time to this report.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was in critical condition; at that time, no arrests had been made, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating. This segment seemed brief, possibly because it involved a crime in a predominantly black neighborhood or a minority victim. I have noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention. When a white individual becomes a victim, the media tends to focus heavily on the story; however, when a minority is involved, it may not even make the news.\n\nAnother story detailed a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided information on where they believed the incident occurred, determining it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story discussed the forecasted rain and thunderstorms set for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures staying in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was relatively short, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. He was around six feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. It seemed they spent an unusual amount of time highlighting his race and skin tone.\n\nAnother piece was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas. He was found guilty of conspiring to transport large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Curiously, instead of stating he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" perhaps to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund, or ETF, is a type of security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it offers greater flexibility as it is traded like a stock on an exchange. ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund while allowing for the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase just a single share in any transaction. Despite these enticing benefits, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay a commission on any ETF trades, akin to stock transactions. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast range of funds available. Despite the clear advantages, it’s always wise for astute investors to scrutinize whether these benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will assess the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 holdings within the ETF to determine if owning a single ETF provides benefits comparable to owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could yield a more optimal return or Sharpe ratio.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF efficiently, we focus only on the top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF’s total assets. Listed below are these top ten holdings and their respective percentages of the total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use their current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate each stock’s contribution to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted solely of these ten stocks in the proportions allocated by the ETF. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart demonstrates that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it remains possible that the means of these two portfolios may not differ significantly from each other statistically.\n\nTo assess whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, adjusting it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Examining Figure 17, it’s evident that the number of commuter log submissions plummeted significantly during the third month of the initiative, which was somewhat discouraging. The reasons for this decline are not entirely clear. One factor could be the arrival of winter at a New England campus, as fewer people choose to commute by bike or on foot during colder months, potentially contributing to the downturn. December is also the end of the fall semester, a time when students and staff are preoccupied with finalizing academic responsibilities and grades, possibly leading them to overlook the commuter log. Furthermore, December heralds the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to be present on campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which may also explain the lower log numbers. However, this doesn’t fully account for the lack of submissions in February. It’s plausible that any project of this kind might start with enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counteract this, we initiated Carpool Challenge Week in March, a campaign aimed at revitalizing interest, which successfully increased log submissions. Thus, one major challenge we faced was sustaining project momentum amid both a natural decline in interest and the specific issues posed by holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education.\n\nAnother obstacle for this initiative, as with any alternative commuting project, is that individuals often cherish the autonomy and convenience of driving their own vehicles, a concept deeply rooted in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, such as gift certificates for local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the independent bookstore, and even some larger chain stores. It’s intriguing to consider how more substantial prizes, like a quality bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, might have impacted engagement. Such prizes could have alleviated the decline in participation experienced during the project. The nature of the prizes remained constant throughout the project. However, if the prize value had increased over time, it might have bolstered participation. Initially, the gift cards were quite effective, but if we had announced the inclusion of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, it’s conceivable that participation and engagement would have risen rather than fallen.",
            "As I explored the early Edison films available in the Library of Congress, I focused on viewing all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often utilize inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily aimed at outlining the stylistic elements typical to most trick films while also identifying unique evolutionary features in a few later productions. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are characterized by their reliance on set-bound scenes within a frontal proscenium, lack of camera movement, use of long and medium shots, and a one shot = one film approach. However, some early twentieth-century films began to challenge these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is the use of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movements of figures or objects. This setup, rooted in theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. One limitation of this stage-like arrangement is that characters in trick films usually only move laterally, rather than towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal plane. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays put.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also results in a predominance of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are notably absent from any of the trick films in the Edison collection. This mirrors theatrical and vaudevillian traditions where audiences viewed the entire performance within the confines of the stage's borders. Like many early films, actors in these trick films remain in the middle ground, never advancing towards the camera, hence the absence of close-ups.\n\nTypically, early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This restricts most trick films to a duration of about a minute or less, based on the frames per second. It also constrains their dramatic or narrative potential, as they mostly depict brief vaudeville-like tricks, such as magic acts, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, it's important to note that in trick films, what appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience doesn’t always equate to a single physical shot. A \"shot\" might actually consist of several segments stitched together to create an illusion, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as one continuous shot by viewers.",
            "In his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the classic \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its paradoxical nature. This literary style has faced both criticism and acclaim, with some dismissing it for lacking depth while others praise it for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, often credited as the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blends elements of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge this new genre, introducing a fresh approach to storytelling. Walpole incorporates traditional theatrical components along with a 'modern' portrayal of nature found in contemporary novels, branding his work as \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic drama, architecture, and customs. Even during the release of The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" described a variety of cultures, styles, and eras, often perceived as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" social and literary \"advancements.\" The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which offers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, has allowed the Gothic to endure over time, appearing both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original publication. \n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, which involved training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the initial Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds significant value for Gothic authors due to its representation of the archetypal knight—courageous, honorable, and capable—and the perceived absence of such ideals in their society, particularly noted by Walpole. By employing chivalric ideals and customs, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future shift from Gothic to Romantic, and serves as a means to critique and potentially improve the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was amid political turmoil and concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and facing (arguably) unfair criticism, he might have begun to consider, albeit implicitly, that the morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had somehow been lost in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, notably Frederic. Before even meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he exemplifies many chivalric qualities. He is depicted as a prince who has endured suffering, been deeply affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been slain by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the journey of goods from the moment a customer places an order, through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, until they reach the end consumer. This concept was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to quickly and efficiently meet customer needs. The supply chain is built around six core components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain is production, serving as the cornerstone for the entire process. It involves determining the timing, reasons, locations, and methods of production. Managers must be attuned to customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends—the primary indicator of consumer demands. With a clear understanding of market needs, managers can decide on the products to manufacture and their quantities. Subsequently, they choose the optimal production site, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Once the production location is set, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Precision in every aspect of production is crucial, as any oversight can result in significant time and financial losses. During my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, I observed that both companies employed structured processes and guidelines for all business operations, from employee uniforms to shipment receivables, ensuring smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe next critical component is supply, which involves strategic decision-making to establish a facility's core competencies and potential outsourcing partnerships. A company might operate several production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must identify the most suitable division for different product processes, occasionally opting to outsource to enhance speed. This strategy, known as velocity, aims to deliver quality and flexibility while minimizing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are often recognized for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the time. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while set in the Victorian era, deviate from this pattern. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which is uncommon for the period's literature. This approach enhances the depth of the characters by providing greater insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“In a sudden rush, a multitude of confusing thoughts overwhelmed his mind. It was as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were in a heated argument: for their very words echoed in his ears; and when he managed to focus on himself, … he realized he was speaking to them…. Abruptly, he was jolted by the sound of gunfire; shouts and cries filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and chaos, as an unseen force whisked him away swiftly. Amidst these rapid visions, there was a vague, troubling sense of pain, which tormented him constantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth novels frequently use elements of mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though each case serves different purposes. In Oliver Twist, such occurrences often offer insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pain, and his awareness of the reality around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences it vividly as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. This passage highlights the lack of control Oliver has over the unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, as illustrated by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself engulfs him; his senses are dulled, and he fails to notice the “unseen hand” carrying him away. He relives his despair, no longer shocked by pain, as it has become a constant, more associated with fear than surprise. This raises the question of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it is certainly not Oliver himself. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances, as he cannot even attempt to influence the outcome, even with his life at stake. This passage suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own survival.\n\n“The day slipped by – day! It vanished as quickly as it arrived – and night descended once more; a night both long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I found myself working in an after-school program dedicated to tutoring young students in elementary school. My primary aim was to assist them in overcoming challenges in various subjects, though I was particularly adept in English and reading. One day, an instructor asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in the third or fourth grade and was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; while he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, others seemed to completely baffle him. It was odd. Adrian was of Latino heritage, that much I could tell, but his spoken English was impeccable. We continued to face difficulties until the day I encountered his mother. I was supervising a few students who hadn’t gone on a field trip when she arrived. She spoke no English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it suddenly became clear to me: Adrian’s issue wasn’t reading itself but his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I’m not sure how much my realization helped him, but I certainly hope he’s improved since then.\n\nThis story highlights the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It serves as a reminder that these challenges aren’t always as visible as they might seem. Even a child who is fluent in spoken English can face substantial hurdles when it comes to reading. We can all acknowledge this problem exists, but the question remains: how do we address it? For Adrian, the solution was relatively straightforward: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. However, for many children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. A single answer doesn’t suffice. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes—none of these alone can solve the issue. The solution lies in integrating all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent concept, beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research suggests that children in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. There is considerable apprehension surrounding this idea, with concerns that it might be a misuse of resources or that the majority of students will not benefit. However, this perception is incorrect. If we were to make such programs the norm rather than the exception, all students could gain from them. But how should we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be neither reasonable nor realistic. Nonetheless, there is no reason we cannot employ bilingual aides or tutors to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some are guided to Sunday school to explore this notion, others to Temple, while some embark on an inner quest for answers. Many people readily embrace the religious beliefs handed down by their parents. Yet, there are those who completely reject these beliefs, unwilling to accept anything beyond their own egocentric reality. At times, we might adopt a set of values only to later replace them with another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our individual spiritual perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness into illumination.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain as it drummed on the tin roof above, smoking cigarettes together. The rainwater overflowed from the gutters, submerging the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed part searching, part reminiscing. Over the past few months, he had grown thinner, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair had thinned more than I remembered, too. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt isolated, scared, and found it difficult to express how much I would miss him because acknowledging it would make it too real for both of us. I embraced him, then sat back down, moving my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't lessened his suffering but had merely extended his life by a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't find meaning in prolonging his pain. I questioned what kind of God could allow this to happen. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt He had ceased listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his transition from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that had given me life come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone else did, even his family, and I believed he wouldn't have wanted his only child to be a witness to his death. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate of Republicanism during his time. Although primarily an agriculturist, his involvement in agriculture and his short stint in politics shaped him into a person recognized for his commitment and forthrightness regarding individual liberty and governance. His strong belief in an agrarian lifestyle heavily influenced his perspectives on governmental issues. His efforts to sustain and promote what he viewed as the most noble of professions significantly shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nJohn Taylor envisioned the United States as having a remarkable opportunity to establish an exemplary system, free from any pre-existing native traditions that might impede the founders of the government. This, he argued, paved the way for a system of self-governance. Taylor was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals and how these rights were interconnected; the denial of one would undermine them all, diminishing their overall value. He argued that these rights should remain untouchable by the government. He opposed the notion that in a \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence would prevail, asserting that such dynamics should not exist in a civilized society.\n\nTaylor believed that crafting an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the inherent good and evil within humans. He held strong convictions on the duality of morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and deter capitalism, suggesting that a government grounded in these principles would operate justly, despite being led by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions, he deemed it harmful only when it extended beyond building a society for the common good to creating sub-groups that thrived at others' expense. A sound government, he believed, was essential to curb humanity's inherent evil, yet it required vigilant oversight to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a significantly limited Federal government, endowed with no more rights or powers than those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. Taylor was aware that a sprawling Federal government could be costly and prone to tyranny. However, he also recognized that a straightforward, literal interpretation of the Constitution could be perilous without considering the framers' intentions, as it could easily lead to corruption. Moreover, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the genuine foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly depicted the nation as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single unified entity.",
            "As I looked down, my mind blankly absorbed the scene before me. Without emotion or sound, I observed with a practiced awareness that analyzed but refused to connect the object of my gaze to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind almost faster than I could recognize them. My consciousness functioned so seamlessly that it felt as if I had no real thoughts of my own, just a fluid experience of what I was observing.\n\nOnce, upon the recommendation of an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, I had wanted to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from the basics of a pencil to the brain's process of interpreting lines. One technique it taught was to frame any picture the artist wanted to study, transforming a detailed scene—like a fruit bowl on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a more manageable image, simply a bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nIn that moment, staring down at the bowl, I couldn't mentally project that artist’s frame. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance artists showcased a spectrum of colors. If I were to aspire to an artistic perspective, before me lay the beginnings of my picture, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nWith fingertips touching my chosen tool of creativity, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, shaping what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled smoothly and clearly. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My muscles tightened, jerked, and twitched more urgently on the second try as my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown package remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet spaced apart, a green tie uncomfortably knotted at my neck, I frowned at the unwelcome bundle of processed material left as a message for those cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some introspective moments, my hand moved to the right, grabbed the end of the toilet paper, and wrapped itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers are facing a troubling reality on the roads. Multiple factors converge to create a dangerous scenario for America's youngest motorists. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience also plays a significant role, leading to more fatal collisions, increased instances of rollovers, speeding, and vehicles veering off the road.\n\nTeenagers are particularly vulnerable when driving with their friends—a common occurrence that anyone familiar with teenage behavior can attest to. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo enhance the safety of young drivers, states like California have implemented provisional licenses, which restrict driving hours and prohibit having other minors as passengers. However, these provisional licenses are, in my view, merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically unprepared to manage the dangers and duties of driving adequately. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 years old might be too young for a standard driver's license. His research, as reported by USA Today, indicates that individuals under the age of 19-20 often seek thrills, which could justify delaying the age at which one can drive until this behavior stabilizes. Continuing to grant licenses to teenagers could perpetuate the occurrence of fatal accidents, with potentially severe consequences as more young drivers take to the roads.\n\nAddressing this problem through legislation would be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver’s education to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be permitted to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before a full license is granted, and a certain number of driving practice hours would still be necessary. These hours could be based on existing state requirements, such as California's current mandate of six hours of behind-the-wheel instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that teen driver fatality rates are a nationwide concern, a unified, national legislative approach would be a logical and, I believe, effective strategy for safeguarding young drivers across the country. This proposal is not entirely new.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it offers a concise explanation of the disorder. Following this, it delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it concludes with suggestions on how educators in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, (C)APD is defined as the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the underlying neurobiologic activity that facilitates this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). In essence, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory information correctly. Individuals with CAPD can hear adequately, hence are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" The challenge lies in the brain's ability to interpret sounds, such as distinguishing words or separating conversations from ambient noise, which doesn't function as expected.\n\nThe origins of what is now known as CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during the study of children with communication disorders. In 1954, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began creating tests for these children. Later, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the Central Auditory Nervous System (CANS) related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself through various symptoms: individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially; have trouble distinguishing between multiple \"acoustic events\"; fail to recognize sound patterns; have difficulty detecting changes in speech, such as identifying sarcasm through vocal tone; experience one sound being masked by another; lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues in a meaningful way for action; and find it challenging to discern the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the individual must undergo a screening involving \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be carried out by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and other professionals using diverse measures to evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This might include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, particularly how the individual reacts to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool or test with a high success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests present the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking them to discern specific items, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "As I embark on my journey in social work, I aim to carve out a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on aiding children who have faced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethical principles, dedication to enhancing interpersonal relationships, and a commitment to my own professional growth to maintain competence. These values are not only integral to social work but also hold personal significance for me.\n\nFrom an early age, I was drawn to helping others, although I was uncertain about the specific career path I should pursue. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their issues and resorting to inadequate coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations prompted me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Despite this, I remained undecided about my career direction and chose to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had contacted the police regarding his parents. I decided to visit the boy's parents to offer any assistance I could. I discreetly expressed my concerns to the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as legal action couldn't assist the teenager. When I engaged the parents in conversation, they appeared anxious and made excuses for their son’s \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for what they termed \"simple\" family disputes. This experience solidified my resolve to pursue a career in social work to support children caught in similar family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value in social work. Society often claims to value the individual and mourns those lost, yet the societal notion of the \"individual\" often adheres to outdated traditions rather than true uniqueness. If we truly mourn lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I value my individuality and resist imposing limitations on myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I stood against social injustice in various ways: by dyeing my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, participating in the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance (GSBA), and opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am a staunch advocate for social justice and will continue to challenge social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks in understanding insomnia. The biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. On the other hand, the Sociocultural models consider the influence of environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. This review examines insomnia through these lenses, analyzing various studies to clarify and elaborate on each model. The paper also evaluates the research findings, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental disorders, or those associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional sleep disorder categories may arise from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves trouble with initiating or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia entails difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve sleep-related behavioral or physiological anomalies. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders involve difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily concentrates on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders examines genetic, hereditary, and physiological factors. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. Research involving mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are key in sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. The sociocultural aspect suggests that inherited phenotypes affecting this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, potentially impacting various life areas such as education, work, and routine activities requiring concentration.",
            "Having been a student at University Park for two and a half years, or four and a half semesters, I've faced the challenges of navigating campus, as many others do. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm at East Halls, nearly the farthest point east on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, located near the center of campus, often took up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather was as unpredictable as it frequently is in State College. I spoke with an alum who is only a few years older and discovered that not long ago, large expanses of unused land separated East Halls from the rest of the university. Nowadays, that space hosts sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus keeps growing, moving around becomes increasingly challenging. How can we improve mobility? On a college campus, bicycles are the answer. However, owning a bike is not enough; students must use them, and the campus should accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend who started biking again after a long break. He wondered why he had ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are fantastic; for some time, it wasn't trendy to ride one, but it's the best way to get around.” Beyond being beneficial for health, cycling is an efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some effort, you can travel 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike was my smartest decision this year. My classes in the Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, can be reached in just 5 minutes on my bike if I push myself. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building but not always easy to traverse, whether biking or walking. While walking has its merits, I simply don't have the time. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable way to reach classes, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. That adds up to over two and a half hours each week, not including time spent walking to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley explores the looming dangers of technology intertwined with the capitalistic framework by crafting a dystopian universe. Within this society, the collective is prioritized over the individual, and people are systematically conditioned from birth to chase immediate gratification above everything else. The inhabitants are portrayed as mere chess pieces in a grander scheme, bound to a singular ideology governed by the World Controller. When viewed through the prism of Marxist theory, the novel highlights Huxley's concerns about the evolution of these systems. The frequent use of Marxist concepts, such as homogeny and reification, underscores the notion that Huxley's work critiques the flaws in the economic trends of his era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which suggests that ordinary citizens are kept in the dark about their true relationships with other social classes, being more focused on their personal gain. This stems from the ideological control exerted over the proletariat and common workers, a theme evident in the conditioning of the populace in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack true autonomy; their compulsion to consume and indulge is amplified through sleep-teaching, all under the manipulation of the World Controller. The idea of hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is clearly depicted here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, essentially endorsing an ideology that upholds the capitalist and consumerist framework. Meanwhile, the upper classes, despite having the capacity to recognize this system, largely do nothing about it; few, like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes significantly illustrate the perceived oppression inherent in capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are nonexistent. The novel seemingly avoids differentiating characters, even among the main ones, who lack depth. Perhaps Huxley implies that the convergence of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love is absent, as are the extremes of any particular emotion; instead, interactions remain shallow, depicted through men’s remarks about women focusing on physical traits (such as their 'pneumatic' quality) and women's unreserved discussions about their encounters. Additionally, each class's acceptance of their position within the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering adherence to their roles within the community signifies Marxist views on the proletariat, who are misled into believing their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, comply, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A significant topic of intense debate in the class was whether Islam should be considered a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more pertinent today than it was in the past. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I have noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile outlook on Islam and extremists to a more tolerant perspective in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Borac Obama, who has Muslim roots in his family, would have emerged.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me because it seems to contradict what I know about his history. From my understanding and previous learning, I believed Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, taking over tribes and compelling them to adopt the faith. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, who humbled himself and was eventually sought out by people who recognized the 'truth' in his teachings.\n\nFurthermore, there are notable parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. A prominent example is when he supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This writing style leads me to conclude that the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who needed no validation but simply lived truthfully and performed miracles. This portrayal seems to diminish the significance of the life and miracles of Jesus Christ. It feels as though they are attempting to appropriate aspects of Jesus's life and character through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, the biography contains numerous stories that appear to aim at providing evidence of people 'on their own' converting to Islam. However, many of these stories are recounted from a third-party perspective, with the author narrating what was heard from others. This approach, rather than confirming the stories' authenticity, seems to make them appear more dubious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts seem to challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble leader, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to prominence.",
            "After Jesus' life, Christian thought developed in ways that diverged significantly from what he originally taught and believed. If we examine this historical journey broadly, there's a noticeable drift of Christianity away from its foundational roots. In the modern world, there's a growing consciousness and a remarkable progressive inclination. Although traditionalists persist and resist any ideas beyond their inherited teachings, they might not hold enough sway to shape the entire landscape. Among Christians, historical awareness is set to expand greatly in the years ahead. An aspiration will emerge to separate the doctrines that accumulated over time from the true intentions of Christianity’s founder. It could take many decades or even centuries, but the result will be unavoidable: a significant shift in the course of Christian history, moving back toward its original form. A burgeoning movement will progressively peel back layers of doctrine, as if time were rewinding, until only the core concepts Jesus presented to humanity remain, before others influenced the narrative. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, many will be inspired to worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering solely to his teachings. The church as an institution will endure to guide this transformation. Yet, as theological perspectives reset, the broad diversity within Christianity will contract, leading to increasing homogeneity in beliefs and practices. Across regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will observe growing similarities instead of differences. Human history is marked by significant reversions. For instance, Christians once faced persecution by the Roman Empire, only for it to later become a Christian institution. In our own nation's history, we transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming reversion will unfold within Christianity, unraveling history to find its source and minimizing diversity along the way. It’s important to highlight that this process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what transpired after Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back far enough, we encounter Judaism as the theological bedrock of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish community was not unified; it was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" reveals the inherent tendency of humans to be selfish and greedy. The narrative illustrates how individuals often prioritize their personal gain above all else, neglecting those beneath them. This theme is prominently depicted through the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding and enhancing their enterprises, showing little concern for the people or things adversely affected by their progress. Upton Sinclair's work captures this notion vividly: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair paints a picture of the environmental devastation caused by industrial pollution, highlighting the owners' disregard for the harm inflicted on people and animals. They remain indifferent to the smoke pouring from the factories and the waste runoff surrounding Packingtown.\n\nMoreover, the welfare of their employees is of little importance to these owners and managers, whose main goal is profit maximization. Sinclair describes this cutthroat environment as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long hours and face abrupt layoffs without notice or support in finding new employment. During the period \"The Jungle\" is set, worker protections were virtually nonexistent, enabling managers and owners to exploit laborers in harsh conditions. Although not explicitly stated in the book, those who toiled in Packingtown faced grueling conditions both at work and in their living situations. Support systems for workers were absent, and unions often exploited rather than aided them. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe regarded \"Dream-Land\" as one of his more accomplished poems. In this work, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. Virgil's use of \"Thulé\" referred to a distant island north of Britain, seen by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, it's worth noting that Poe's interest in German literature could have influenced his usage. \n\nThis particular reference is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his analysis titled \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes the similarities between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe may have been emulating Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was a renowned author known for the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after receiving a goblet from his wife, falls into despair and heavy drinking following her death. Ultimately, he bequeaths his belongings to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the ocean before dying. The similarities between the king's melancholy in \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's depiction in \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works, notably using \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's dark and desolate landscape, haunted by memories of deceased friends, painting a world devoid of color. These themes resonate with Goethe's poem, where the king, having lost his wife, is overcome with loneliness and despair. It's as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" steps directly into the world of Goethe's creation.\n\nGoethe was a prominent literary figure, and Poe would likely have been familiar with his works, not least through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe's acknowledgment of Tennyson's influence suggests that he would have encountered Goethe's writings through the numerous reproductions that followed their original publication.",
            "Under the legal framework in California, the question arises whether a customer who was injured due to slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket could potentially receive punitive damages if it is demonstrated that the store manager acted with malice, given that he was notified twice about the spill but did not address it for thirty minutes because he was having dinner. It seems unlikely that a judge would outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To support a claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must show evidence that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer might argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential danger of ignoring a spill, especially since multiple customers had sustained injuries from similar incidents in the months leading up to Palmer’s accident. Despite this, Martin did not ensure the spill was cleaned up. The argument that Martin's conduct was despicable is less compelling but still justifiable given the fact that there had been six slip-and-fall accidents in 2009, yet Martin did not take necessary steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Mr. Martin, who responded similarly. At 5:30 pm on that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a significant back injury. Before Palmer's fall, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and we are considering whether to submit a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as behavior intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and performed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as per § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct to be malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" according to Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From a young age, she always sensed a certain emptiness within her. This longing, elusive and unfulfilled, began around age 14 as she transitioned into her teenage years. By the time she reached 17, the feeling persisted, but she had realized it was a person she sought, not an object. However, no boy captivated her interest. Though some were drawn to her and awkwardly tried to win her over, none sparked her curiosity. She often pondered this unusual situation, wondering what could cause such an anomaly in a teenage girl. Despite years of reflection and various theories, no satisfying answer emerged, leaving her to navigate life with an ongoing sense of curiosity about her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents exemplified calmness, rarely engaging in disputes with each other or with their daughter. When disagreements did arise, they usually centered on her desire for independence and self-expression. Though she contrasted her parents' placid nature with her vibrant and engaging personality, it made her well-liked, coupled with her innate kindness.\n\nYet today was anything but tranquil. As she moved through the house seeking new creative inspirations, her mother’s sudden scream from the kitchen shattered the peace. Panic-stricken, she rushed in, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in distress, muttering \"Ow\" between labored breaths. Kneeling beside her, she placed a supportive hand on her mother. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were strained, and her daughter could see the severe pain in her mother's eyes. \"Okay Mom, guide me on how to help you,\" she replied. With her mother’s direction, she relied on her strength training to lift her into the car, laying her gently in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital greeted her with the familiar smells of antiseptic and anxiety, but her focus remained solely on her mother’s wellbeing. Swiftly, she carried her into the building, urgently seeking medical assistance. A cluster of concerned staff gathered, one of them quickly bringing a gurney to lay her mother upon. They whisked her away for immediate care, leaving the daughter in a state of anxious waiting.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a step stool while attempting to reach a vase on the top shelf of their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is an adapted form of the traditional Med diet, distinguished by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but incorporating fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permissible.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, an intervention trial indicated that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and enhancing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Earlier research did not specifically concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, researchers monitored 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The study spanned from 1984 to 2004, during which the authors calculated an aMed diet score on six occasions using self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs”) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation checks. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were deemed “probable” and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. Factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin usage, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and provide a better representation of long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments for confounding factors (elements that might skew results) were made by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, correlated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease-related deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign reads: Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nStanding solitary on a street corner, Ellen Page, the renowned actress from *Juno*, holds a piece of cardboard above her head with the alarming message inscribed in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a nation in Southeast Asia governed by a repressive military junta that seized control via a coup d’état in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed the first public demonstrations in a decade. These protests, led predominantly by Burmese monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the hue of the monks' robes. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly permitted the monks to assemble peacefully, but as the protests gained public interest, the situation quickly deteriorated into violent clashes between the military junta and the monks. The military began raiding monasteries nationwide, and foreign journalists were detained, with a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fatally shot during a protest on September 27, 2007. Although the official death toll is recorded as 13, Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nSuch events are not new. While these are recent instances of global atrocities, the ambition of governments to suppress dissent and exert absolute control over their citizens has persisted throughout history. In ancient Rome, emperors claimed divine selection for absolute authority over societal facets. Japanese emperors are deemed divine, destined to lead their people to prosperity through the creation of inventions like Motorola cell phones and practices like hara-kiri. Meanwhile, our then-president, George W. Bush, reportedly held weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republic Party.\n\nNoteworthy examples of such actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered against governmental authoritarianism. The death toll estimates from this event vary significantly, with official Chinese reports citing 200-300 fatalities, while the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically exterminated Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ stands as an extreme instance, where countless individuals of Jewish descent were persecuted and executed over several years across numerous nations.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his exceptional talent in shaping his orchestra's sound. While his piano presence is often understated in the selections for this assignment, Ellington's genius as a composer shines through in his ability to create intricate and complex compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. He laid the groundwork for soloists to freely improvise, while also crafting meticulously orchestrated pieces that showcased the distinct styles of his musicians, effectively bringing out musical themes. This approach allowed him to emphasize the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in cohesive and original sounds tailored to each piece. Ellington's profound understanding of individual players' sounds and how they harmonized within an evolving ensemble led to some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its discussion of Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's skill in adding vocal texture and color without relying on lyrics, and it demonstrates his knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a hallmark of his career. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece consists of six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Features a call-and-response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic tone that shifts to a rougher sound by the end.  \nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the melody and highlights several extended blue notes.  \nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.  \nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.  \nChorus 5: The climactic chorus with reeds leading the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.  \nChorus 6: Returns to the first chorus structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, acting as an instrument.  \nTag: Concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color in this piece is a stylistic trait seen throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his mastery of tight orchestration with his keen sense for tonal color. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal qualities of Miley's playing and the instrumental characteristics of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington effectively employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key figure in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What factors influence the way organisms evolve? Are there limitations or constraints shaping the direction of evolutionary changes? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to study general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, considering both their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the genus Prunum, alongside experimental studies, can help unveil the mechanisms driving the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental transformations. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal forms. These parameters were fed into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By modeling hypothetical shell forms, we aimed to interpret the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. The findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary processes in this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a structure resembling a tube that spirals through 360 degrees over time. These spirals or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which encircle an imaginary central axis. This axis extends through the shell's central column, termed the columella. The growth rate of the whorls can differ, with each whorl separated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last one, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the base is at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer with the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nTo count the whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has witnessed little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. While the nation appears to be on track with several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the expected progress in child and maternal health remains significantly lacking to meet the 2015 targets. The underlying causes of these deficiencies are explored below, suggesting a focus on reinforcing the healthcare system rather than just implementing program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen some advancement in the presence of skilled health professionals at births, with 72% of deliveries now attended by such personnel. However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who are not equipped to handle medical complications during childbirth, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. Hence, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, indicating that substantial efforts are still necessary. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the number of children under five with diarrhea being treated by health professionals. Although data on postnatal care remains sparse, it's evident that this area requires attention due to low nationwide rates.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than anticipated, hovering around 4%. This figure highlights another significant concern. In urban regions, the c-section rate is 7%, whereas in rural areas, it is a mere 2%, revealing disparities in healthcare access. Health services are evidently more accessible in urban areas. Another access issue pertains to vertical equity, with a 27% disparity in service use between the poorest and wealthiest segments. This indicates that poorer individuals face greater obstacles in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: should Indonesia focus on service-specific approaches or bolster the overall health system, irrespective of pre and post-natal care? Program-specific strategies are appealing since they offer precise, manageable goals and often yield quicker results. However, there are significant drawbacks. Prioritizing one health sector can divert funds from others and concentrate human resources in that area, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Additionally, operating multiple parallel programs can lead to service duplication and uncoordinated efforts, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded to encompass a vast array of genres, making it challenging to catalog them comprehensively. Adding to this complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres within popular music over the last four decades. Its expressiveness is evident in its wide emotional range, often gravitating towards darker themes. Its diversity became apparent early on, as enthusiasts recognized its inherent flexibility and began crafting their own sub-genres, which in turn spawned further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented with specialized niches that defining heavy metal itself has become a challenge. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet, like all music forms, it originated from a specific point. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend what constitutes the metal movement and why it transcends being merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by its affinity for darkness. It can be described as music that embodies excess—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatrical flair. There is less primitivism, and more technical skill; musicians in metal bands are often highly proficient, and this expertise is reflected in their music. Moreover, metal is—perhaps unsurprisingly—deeply intertwined with drug culture. The psychedelic drug wave of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental and otherworldly music productions, with artists using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, contrasting sharply with the lighter emotional tones of much popular music. Subsequent generations of metal bands have drawn inspiration from these dark, visceral elements, reminiscent of the Romantic Era’s influence. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter illustrate the movement's signature darkness.\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter reveal the darker aspects of the Beatles, reflecting a tumultuous, perhaps drug-influenced experience. This track is often regarded as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a similarly heavy and dark Rolling Stones track. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity, which is why the song was included on The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist painters began their exploration of dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, both in his art and ambitions. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only portrays a woman entranced by the wonders of a dreamt landscape but also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations as an artist. From the onset of his career, Rousseau longed for recognition and admiration from fellow artists and the art community. However, achieving this dream was fraught with internal conflict. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle—whether to conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished or to remain true to his unique creative voice and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream through this lens, one must understand Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed moderate prosperity (Shattuck 47). He received no formal art education and worked for the French municipal toll service, often mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector, until he was forty (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving only a daughter named Julia, plunged Rousseau into deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting as a means of renewal and comfort. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized rural life, Rousseau’s work reflected the aspirations and experiences of the average person of his social standing.\n\nRousseau’s yearning for acceptance in the art world is understandable when considered in context. Untrained and starting his art career later in life, he competed alongside other acclaimed modern artists. Only after years of effort did Rousseau start gaining recognition, around the time Matisse was establishing his reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes the contrast between the two; while Matisse feared falling into artistic clichés, Rousseau sought to create works conventional enough to earn him a place in the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous intellectuals have suggested a close relationship between ethics and aesthetics, and between truth and beauty. I am convinced that there is a fundamental reason behind this connection. As John Keats eloquently puts it in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, yet our appreciation of ethics and aesthetics, as Keats hints, seems to arise without formal instruction. Both areas attempt to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely aims to explain what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action moral, rather than establishing rules for creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nCritiquing art or morality often falls short of capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural significance, but these don't fully explain why it is considered great art. When someone speaks about a favorite artwork or piece of literature, they often say, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed analysis. I believe that art and morals cannot be entirely distilled into a list of qualities. As Flannery O'Connor remarks, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Even with a thorough description of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I see the same quality in ethics. As Wittgenstein points out, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this indefinable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that the close relationship between morality and art stems from their profound impact on us at a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. We experience them deeply, yet cannot fully explain them. This connection is particularly strong in the realm of literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a formidable and cohesive nation with a diverse cultural identity stretching from the Alpine region of Munich to the Baltic city of Kiel. This cultural essence is discernible from Cologne on the Rhine River, traversing central Germany to Dresden on the Elbe. Given its distinctive heritage, it is no surprise that contemporary Germany emerged from a mix of various origins and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral roots of the German people lie in Germania, though the name's origins are debated among experts. According to Tacitus, the name came from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and engaged the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and encountered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine with dubious intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had vanquished (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin remains uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue. In his initial account of these wars, Caesar observes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name derives from the weapon they wielded, a spear known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” implying that the Germans were boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman chronicler Tacitus, in his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” which explored the Germans' origins, noted, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not initially. They ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally embarked on land campaigns but typically returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and offering their services as soldiers in the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the notion that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these facades to avoid losing their true identity. However, ceasing such deception poses a significant challenge, as it may lead to feelings of isolation. Consequently, individuals are faced with the choice between safeguarding their own identity or maintaining relationships with those around them. Some may react indifferently to the revelation of deception, yet others may feel deeply offended by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of deception related to gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises several questions, most notably, the reason behind the disguise. Why would someone abandon their identity to assume the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is clearly a measure of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels compelled to masquerade as a man for protection against potential threats. Her strategy is successful, but it also isolates her from other women, depriving her of crucial support. To complicate matters further, her disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and, consequently, falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, she must navigate her repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nAlthough this might be seen as a progressive perspective, contemporary readers may view \"Twelfth Night\" as showcasing how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Certain scenes suggest that these characters might possess unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because she believes Cesario is male, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems improbable, as Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia appears to mock those of his era who judge others based solely on appearances. This is evident in Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually regarding Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often remembered for its harshness, particularly concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it is important to recognize that no colonial empire can be fully described with such a broad statement. The German colonial empire displayed a wide range of policies and governing styles, differing as much as its geographic spread. Educational offerings across the colonies were similarly varied. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a substantial number of well-educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories were also lauded by writers of the period.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established state schools and contributed significantly to the education of the local population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. The government did, however, allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans within the colony, developing a system of state schools and providing greater support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies saw a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" A variety of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the different experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and highlighting recent research on the perceptions of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere exists an extensive body of literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these texts are in German and were composed in the early 20th century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. The primary goal of these early works was to detail the characteristics of educational systems within these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse by offering comparative studies of education across various German colonies and providing more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. Notably, Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa directly addresses the topic of this paper. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nRelative to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa enjoyed a somewhat temperate climate, although much of the area is characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored the relatively favorable living conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once experienced a prolonged and challenging period of rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States launched an attack on Mexico, resulting in a victory that allowed it to annex Texas and the American Southwest. Several other conflicts occurred between these two nations, finally subsiding just before the outbreak of the First World War. The root of the rivalry lay in significant disagreements over religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a substantial clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is reminiscent of numerous other countries that have long-standing rivalries with their neighbors. Nations that share borders often encounter conflicting interests, which can give rise to adversarial positions. The case of the United States and Mexico mirrors many enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have maintained rivalrous relationships with it, in contrast to other Latin American countries that have generally enjoyed amicable relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences significantly contributed to the divide between the United States and Mexico, a challenge that has troubled many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) argues that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which combined ideological struggle with competition over perceived vital interests, the conflict between the United States and Mexico was rooted in religious disparities rather than political structures. This mutual distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which the United States and Mexico inherited from their colonial predecessors, complicating efforts to establish friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent problem until both the United States and Mexico deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) notes that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and ultimately concluded as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years back, my life took an unexpected turn when I was suddenly disabled by a condition I had never heard of before.\n\nAt that time, I was working as a nurse. I had selected this career driven by a deep-seated need for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always have a job; people will always need medical care,\" was a constant refrain throughout my teen years and beyond. So, even though my aspirations leaned towards becoming a scientist or a journalist—or perhaps both—I opted for a career in nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, without any savings, and unable to work. I remain disabled to this day, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability benefits, I find myself with virtually nothing to claim as my own. I manage to get by, but each day is a battle that challenges my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life feels stable anymore, but there is one truth I hold onto: without the support of my family and a few close friends, I would not have survived these years, regardless of my personal strength. When true calamity hits, you certainly don't feel very strong.\n\nThe reality is that life will always throw unexpected challenges our way, both big and small. No level of preparation can guarantee security, as some obstacles are simply too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nI firmly believe that in the U.S., we need to move away from relying solely on the government, which is showing signs of decay and instability. Instead, I would prefer to see Americans fostering trust and cooperation—supporting one another and being willing to seek support—rather than each person independently preparing for doomsday scenarios.\n\nWhile the U.S. Conservatives praise \"rugged individualism\" as a cornerstone of our nation's history, the truth is that our ancestors persevered through tough times not because of individualism but through compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Those who traveled in wagon trains across the Rockies didn't succeed by going it alone.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. I've assembled a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. I have multiple flashlights, a variety of batteries, an abundance of candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources to maintain a small farm and preserve your own food, go for it. It's a wise choice, as is investing in a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut as you prepare, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the distant past, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later become known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he chose to leave behind worldly life and achieved enlightenment. His teachings became the foundation of Buddhism, with the most traditional branch being Theravada Buddhism. This religion has a history spanning approximately 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in various places, such as Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious meaning despite not being part of Buddha's original teachings. These variations range from ceremonial practices to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, as well as both supportive and challenging forces.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently utilized in this discussion. The idea of internal versus external forces is one of these. Internal forces are those that originate from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces refer to influences from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or seeks to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. Conversely, a benign force does not aim to either harm or assist the Buddhist community, although it might inadvertently do so. These terms will be referenced multiple times throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the fundamental aspects of the religion—the essential doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, or \"three baskets,\" of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka comprises all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical elements of Buddhism. These metaphysical ideas include concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By understanding these concepts, one can end Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. With the cessation of Sansara comes the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts: refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks adhere to many more rules of discipline. The most essential doctrinal aspect in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, acknowledging that life involves suffering; second, that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by cultural factors. Culture isn't just defined by what it is, but also by what it isn't, and what it represents. It's not a monolithic or singular entity, and it's certainly not uniform. Broad statements like \"Russians are always stubborn\" or \"Japanese people are invariably accommodating\" are overly simplistic and fail to capture the complexity of cultures. Understanding cultural generalizations can be useful, but it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the importance of culture in the context of the negotiation and how cultural attitudes can impact discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, people naturally make comparisons to their own culture.\n\nUnderstanding a different culture or mindset may involve exploring its history and acknowledging its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, one should accept it and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, especially when one's bargaining position is weaker. If negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance discussions.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture doesn't only apply to national or international contexts. Companies often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, some prioritize long work hours, while others opt for more flexible schedules. Corporate culture can manifest in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others limit it to company-approved initiatives. The diversity of American corporate culture, varying from one company to another and even within regions of the same company, illustrates the range of perspectives within a societal culture. Other cultures might seem less stratified and more uniform to outsiders, but this exterior similarity invites a deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial because they explain the motivations behind a culture. For instance, in cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superiors. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle. Considering these general characteristics is vital before entering negotiations. However, it's also beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and sets the stage for St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This idea also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we'll explore. Both philosophers defend the same concept, prompting us to evaluate which argument is more compelling. For the sake of brevity and focus, let's assume that they both accurately believe in the existence of the Biblical God. Introducing a different concept of a deity would derail a proper comparison of their arguments, which are centered around a specific notion of God. Despite the merit in their points, neither philosopher offers a comprehensive justification for belief in God.\n\nTo delve into this, we begin by examining St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God can be found internally. He posits that since God exists within our understanding, it is impossible to truly conceive of His nonexistence. Although his explanation can be intricate and occasionally ambiguous, the essence is that the evidence for God resides in our minds. Anselm implies that truth about God is inherently known within us, rendering external evidence unnecessary. This notion of accepting what lacks undeniable empirical evidence is often termed faith in Christian literature.\n\nContrastingly, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be established purely through reason and empirical evidence, without any reliance on faith. This perspective is advantageous for evangelism, a significant aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of individuals solely through logical persuasion. Aquinas outlines five logical proofs for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through these, he illustrates that the necessity of God can be demonstrated logically. Just as one can infer the characteristics and existence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, Aquinas argues that logic alone can reveal God's existence.",
            "Authors frequently employ various techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers towards significant topics. These techniques can vary in their effectiveness. In his novel, \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these methods. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he imbues symbols with meaning and uses them for similar effects. One particular method he employs involves the use of colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, later using these associations to evoke certain feelings related to important objects or themes.\n\nThe associations Fitzgerald creates with the colors white/gray symbolize uniformity, with white connoting a sense of elegance and higher social standing, while gray suggests age and fading. This symbolism is established early in the novel through frequent references to these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted as being \"in white\" (8)—a color choice that extends to various characters and settings: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). A notable deviation from this is observed during Gatsby's party when \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines the meanings of these colors by applying them to mundane or commonplace subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the attendees of Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a metaphor for uniformity (28). Additionally, ordinary people or places are often described using white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes is populated with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), a child on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to denote unimportance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period with little mention of these colors, Daisy is depicted as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her less as a unique character and more as a standardized element that Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues to apply this technique in relation to Daisy, reinforcing the impression of her as a uniform presence. For instance, there is mention of the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and she wears a \"white\" (115) dress prior to the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County thrives in agricultural productivity, largely due to its mild and sunny climate. The region is known for producing a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is significant in San Diego, with many local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk also enjoy popularity. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations, along with recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. These farms present an opportunity for landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use and educational farm tours that can generate revenue.\n\nWhile organic farming can fill a profitable niche, it also contributes to increased biodiversity in the area by avoiding chemical use, which benefits both plants and wildlife. However, organic farming can incur higher costs compared to conventional farming due to its labor-intensive nature. This includes managing pests and weeds without chemicals and fertilizing the soil naturally. Losses can be greater, and small organic farms lack the economies of scale that larger operations have. Additionally, practices beneficial to wildlife but not directly related to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth, may result in increased labor costs. These are some of the reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Although still under review, the plan currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, such as burrowing owls, are declining and may be listed soon.\n\nThis land has a history of being inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the years. To explore the options available to a small farmer for cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly operations, I chose a property from a real estate website and researched potential government programs. I identified an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound and enduring, marked by a spectrum of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other in ways that no one else can, seeing a part of themselves reflected in their sibling. It's during moments of crisis that the true essence of this bond is revealed, for better or worse, accompanied by significant consequences. A deep understanding of these emotions involves grappling with the outcomes they produce. When a brother meets his sibling's gaze and sees a reflection of himself, he perceives his true nature, beyond what others see. It is through actions and their repercussions that one's true character is unveiled. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored by two brothers, accompanied by the tumultuous emotions it evokes. Against a backdrop of vividly depicted scenery, the boys embark on a journey destined for failure. This journey culminates in a scene where bitter disappointment collides with overwhelming pride, leaving only one brother surviving. The theme unfolds through direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of his environment.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From his initial outings with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother he could teach skills such as holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines at Old Woman Swamp. He envisioned a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or sit with him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, given Doodle's fragile heart condition, these dreams were unattainable. Doodle's survival was uncertain from birth, and participation in intense physical activities was nearly impossible. For the protagonist, brimming with youthful fantasies, the realization of these limitations was devastating. At one point, he even contemplates ending Doodle's life by smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would entertain such a thought? Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that fills him with hope, indicating that his resolve was not as strong as it seemed. Deep down, there was an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from its earliest forms to the state-of-the-art advancements we see today, the metaphors used to describe the brain have similarly progressed. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and finally, a computer. While studying the brain, it's crucial to recognize that these metaphors have their limits and may lead us to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory data undergoes continuous transformation through the brain's algorithms using both bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when observing a picture of a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing gathers basic details like color, orientation, and edge detection—where color shifts markedly over a small area—to conclude that a box is present. Top-down processing then leverages decisions from earlier bottom-up steps to expedite recognition of the box. In this scenario, top-down processing might assist in identifying the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped gap in the white field.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter assesses its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. For example, though your brain processes every blade of grass as you glance at your shoes, an effective attention filter stops you from noticing each one separately. Conversely, you might notice your name being spoken even amidst a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, with attention repeatedly shaping the outcomes.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it needs to be stored. Memory is categorized into sensory, working, and long-term types. Initially, information is encoded, and there are encoding methods specific to each sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on structure, which pertains to the appearance of a printed word, phonemically, which relates to the sound of the word, or semantically, which involves the word's meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by electrical signals cycling through a specific series of neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained within the structure of certain proteins.\n\nVarious models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are derived from how humans retrieve memories, others from computer science, and some from neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interlinked based on their relationships. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which could link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial crisis that led to a significant rise in unemployment, a collapse in the housing market, and left many major corporations in disarray. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from shortsighted and reckless political decisions that compelled banks and financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an underdeveloped financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex financial products like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves lacking sufficient capital reserves, spreading turmoil through the repackaged mortgages they had sold and affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought re-election by boosting his popularity. In pursuit of this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, which contributed to the conditions for the subprime crisis that emerged seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the administration to expand loan access to low and moderate-income individuals, while also being pressed by shareholders to sustain its impressive profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As outlined earlier and as Holmes anticipated, poorly conceived lending practices inevitably led to economic collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the intricate nature of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were extensively utilized in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets becoming heavily leveraged in real estate, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert into commercial banks under strict regulatory oversight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your tale where you spread your creative wings and soar, captivating everyone with your enchanting, if not mesmerizing, prose. Or perhaps it's the moment where your audience drifts off or clicks away, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she finds herself drowning in an overload of details, and not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition can be a tricky companion.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the classic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself lost in sprawling text where nothing unfolds, or worse, everything does. Exposition is the mischievous little voice that insists on getting the backstory out of the way to reach the exciting parts (not to be mixed up with the other voice demanding the author share every tiny detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, exposition occurs when a character delivers a lengthy monologue of information like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In novels, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her love at a specific time and place, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span only two pages, with both characters speaking just a couple of lines each. You would anticipate the author to delve into the husband's personality, illustrating through his words and actions how deeply he cherishes his wife, and expect the heroine to demonstrate in various ways how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this was true). A well-crafted introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and offer insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their connection, and hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his loss with her, thereby strengthening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance on the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your task to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues on*) There is often a temptation to gloss over certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he once served in the Air Force, now works as a night manager at a gas station, has been married twice without children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which aired live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The leading story focused on a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Although his wife's name wasn't mentioned, his mugshot was shown, and he appeared quite menacing. As the story was still unfolding, they only spent about two minutes on it, mentioning that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I felt that they dedicated an appropriate amount of time to this report.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was in critical condition; at that time, no arrests had been made, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating. This segment seemed brief, possibly because it involved a crime in a predominantly black neighborhood or a minority victim. I have noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention. When a white individual becomes a victim, the media tends to focus heavily on the story; however, when a minority is involved, it may not even make the news.\n\nAnother story detailed a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided information on where they believed the incident occurred, determining it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story discussed the forecasted rain and thunderstorms set for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures staying in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was relatively short, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. He was around six feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. It seemed they spent an unusual amount of time highlighting his race and skin tone.\n\nAnother piece was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas. He was found guilty of conspiring to transport large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Curiously, instead of stating he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" perhaps to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund, or ETF, is a type of security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it offers greater flexibility as it is traded like a stock on an exchange. ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund while allowing for the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase just a single share in any transaction. Despite these enticing benefits, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay a commission on any ETF trades, akin to stock transactions. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast range of funds available. Despite the clear advantages, it’s always wise for astute investors to scrutinize whether these benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will assess the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 holdings within the ETF to determine if owning a single ETF provides benefits comparable to owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could yield a more optimal return or Sharpe ratio.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF efficiently, we focus only on the top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF’s total assets. Listed below are these top ten holdings and their respective percentages of the total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use their current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate each stock’s contribution to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted solely of these ten stocks in the proportions allocated by the ETF. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart demonstrates that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it remains possible that the means of these two portfolios may not differ significantly from each other statistically.\n\nTo assess whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, adjusting it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Examining Figure 17, it’s evident that the number of commuter log submissions plummeted significantly during the third month of the initiative, which was somewhat discouraging. The reasons for this decline are not entirely clear. One factor could be the arrival of winter at a New England campus, as fewer people choose to commute by bike or on foot during colder months, potentially contributing to the downturn. December is also the end of the fall semester, a time when students and staff are preoccupied with finalizing academic responsibilities and grades, possibly leading them to overlook the commuter log. Furthermore, December heralds the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to be present on campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which may also explain the lower log numbers. However, this doesn’t fully account for the lack of submissions in February. It’s plausible that any project of this kind might start with enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counteract this, we initiated Carpool Challenge Week in March, a campaign aimed at revitalizing interest, which successfully increased log submissions. Thus, one major challenge we faced was sustaining project momentum amid both a natural decline in interest and the specific issues posed by holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education.\n\nAnother obstacle for this initiative, as with any alternative commuting project, is that individuals often cherish the autonomy and convenience of driving their own vehicles, a concept deeply rooted in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, such as gift certificates for local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the independent bookstore, and even some larger chain stores. It’s intriguing to consider how more substantial prizes, like a quality bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, might have impacted engagement. Such prizes could have alleviated the decline in participation experienced during the project. The nature of the prizes remained constant throughout the project. However, if the prize value had increased over time, it might have bolstered participation. Initially, the gift cards were quite effective, but if we had announced the inclusion of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, it’s conceivable that participation and engagement would have risen rather than fallen.",
            "As I explored the early Edison films available in the Library of Congress, I focused on viewing all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often utilize inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily aimed at outlining the stylistic elements typical to most trick films while also identifying unique evolutionary features in a few later productions. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are characterized by their reliance on set-bound scenes within a frontal proscenium, lack of camera movement, use of long and medium shots, and a one shot = one film approach. However, some early twentieth-century films began to challenge these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is the use of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movements of figures or objects. This setup, rooted in theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. One limitation of this stage-like arrangement is that characters in trick films usually only move laterally, rather than towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal plane. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays put.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also results in a predominance of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are notably absent from any of the trick films in the Edison collection. This mirrors theatrical and vaudevillian traditions where audiences viewed the entire performance within the confines of the stage's borders. Like many early films, actors in these trick films remain in the middle ground, never advancing towards the camera, hence the absence of close-ups.\n\nTypically, early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This restricts most trick films to a duration of about a minute or less, based on the frames per second. It also constrains their dramatic or narrative potential, as they mostly depict brief vaudeville-like tricks, such as magic acts, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, it's important to note that in trick films, what appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience doesn’t always equate to a single physical shot. A \"shot\" might actually consist of several segments stitched together to create an illusion, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as one continuous shot by viewers.",
            "In his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the classic \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its paradoxical nature. This literary style has faced both criticism and acclaim, with some dismissing it for lacking depth while others praise it for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, often credited as the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blends elements of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge this new genre, introducing a fresh approach to storytelling. Walpole incorporates traditional theatrical components along with a 'modern' portrayal of nature found in contemporary novels, branding his work as \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic drama, architecture, and customs. Even during the release of The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" described a variety of cultures, styles, and eras, often perceived as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" social and literary \"advancements.\" The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which offers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, has allowed the Gothic to endure over time, appearing both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original publication. \n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, which involved training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the initial Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds significant value for Gothic authors due to its representation of the archetypal knight—courageous, honorable, and capable—and the perceived absence of such ideals in their society, particularly noted by Walpole. By employing chivalric ideals and customs, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future shift from Gothic to Romantic, and serves as a means to critique and potentially improve the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was amid political turmoil and concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and facing (arguably) unfair criticism, he might have begun to consider, albeit implicitly, that the morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had somehow been lost in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, notably Frederic. Before even meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he exemplifies many chivalric qualities. He is depicted as a prince who has endured suffering, been deeply affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been slain by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the journey of goods from the moment a customer places an order, through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, until they reach the end consumer. This concept was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to quickly and efficiently meet customer needs. The supply chain is built around six core components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain is production, serving as the cornerstone for the entire process. It involves determining the timing, reasons, locations, and methods of production. Managers must be attuned to customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends—the primary indicator of consumer demands. With a clear understanding of market needs, managers can decide on the products to manufacture and their quantities. Subsequently, they choose the optimal production site, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Once the production location is set, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Precision in every aspect of production is crucial, as any oversight can result in significant time and financial losses. During my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, I observed that both companies employed structured processes and guidelines for all business operations, from employee uniforms to shipment receivables, ensuring smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe next critical component is supply, which involves strategic decision-making to establish a facility's core competencies and potential outsourcing partnerships. A company might operate several production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must identify the most suitable division for different product processes, occasionally opting to outsource to enhance speed. This strategy, known as velocity, aims to deliver quality and flexibility while minimizing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are often recognized for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the time. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while set in the Victorian era, deviate from this pattern. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which is uncommon for the period's literature. This approach enhances the depth of the characters by providing greater insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“In a sudden rush, a multitude of confusing thoughts overwhelmed his mind. It was as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were in a heated argument: for their very words echoed in his ears; and when he managed to focus on himself, … he realized he was speaking to them…. Abruptly, he was jolted by the sound of gunfire; shouts and cries filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and chaos, as an unseen force whisked him away swiftly. Amidst these rapid visions, there was a vague, troubling sense of pain, which tormented him constantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth novels frequently use elements of mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though each case serves different purposes. In Oliver Twist, such occurrences often offer insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pain, and his awareness of the reality around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences it vividly as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. This passage highlights the lack of control Oliver has over the unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, as illustrated by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself engulfs him; his senses are dulled, and he fails to notice the “unseen hand” carrying him away. He relives his despair, no longer shocked by pain, as it has become a constant, more associated with fear than surprise. This raises the question of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it is certainly not Oliver himself. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances, as he cannot even attempt to influence the outcome, even with his life at stake. This passage suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own survival.\n\n“The day slipped by – day! It vanished as quickly as it arrived – and night descended once more; a night both long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I found myself working in an after-school program dedicated to tutoring young students in elementary school. My primary aim was to assist them in overcoming challenges in various subjects, though I was particularly adept in English and reading. One day, an instructor asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in the third or fourth grade and was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; while he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, others seemed to completely baffle him. It was odd. Adrian was of Latino heritage, that much I could tell, but his spoken English was impeccable. We continued to face difficulties until the day I encountered his mother. I was supervising a few students who hadn’t gone on a field trip when she arrived. She spoke no English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it suddenly became clear to me: Adrian’s issue wasn’t reading itself but his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I’m not sure how much my realization helped him, but I certainly hope he’s improved since then.\n\nThis story highlights the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It serves as a reminder that these challenges aren’t always as visible as they might seem. Even a child who is fluent in spoken English can face substantial hurdles when it comes to reading. We can all acknowledge this problem exists, but the question remains: how do we address it? For Adrian, the solution was relatively straightforward: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. However, for many children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. A single answer doesn’t suffice. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes—none of these alone can solve the issue. The solution lies in integrating all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent concept, beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research suggests that children in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. There is considerable apprehension surrounding this idea, with concerns that it might be a misuse of resources or that the majority of students will not benefit. However, this perception is incorrect. If we were to make such programs the norm rather than the exception, all students could gain from them. But how should we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be neither reasonable nor realistic. Nonetheless, there is no reason we cannot employ bilingual aides or tutors to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some are guided to Sunday school to explore this notion, others to Temple, while some embark on an inner quest for answers. Many people readily embrace the religious beliefs handed down by their parents. Yet, there are those who completely reject these beliefs, unwilling to accept anything beyond their own egocentric reality. At times, we might adopt a set of values only to later replace them with another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our individual spiritual perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness into illumination.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain as it drummed on the tin roof above, smoking cigarettes together. The rainwater overflowed from the gutters, submerging the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed part searching, part reminiscing. Over the past few months, he had grown thinner, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair had thinned more than I remembered, too. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt isolated, scared, and found it difficult to express how much I would miss him because acknowledging it would make it too real for both of us. I embraced him, then sat back down, moving my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't lessened his suffering but had merely extended his life by a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't find meaning in prolonging his pain. I questioned what kind of God could allow this to happen. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt He had ceased listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his transition from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that had given me life come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone else did, even his family, and I believed he wouldn't have wanted his only child to be a witness to his death. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate of Republicanism during his time. Although primarily an agriculturist, his involvement in agriculture and his short stint in politics shaped him into a person recognized for his commitment and forthrightness regarding individual liberty and governance. His strong belief in an agrarian lifestyle heavily influenced his perspectives on governmental issues. His efforts to sustain and promote what he viewed as the most noble of professions significantly shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nJohn Taylor envisioned the United States as having a remarkable opportunity to establish an exemplary system, free from any pre-existing native traditions that might impede the founders of the government. This, he argued, paved the way for a system of self-governance. Taylor was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals and how these rights were interconnected; the denial of one would undermine them all, diminishing their overall value. He argued that these rights should remain untouchable by the government. He opposed the notion that in a \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence would prevail, asserting that such dynamics should not exist in a civilized society.\n\nTaylor believed that crafting an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the inherent good and evil within humans. He held strong convictions on the duality of morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and deter capitalism, suggesting that a government grounded in these principles would operate justly, despite being led by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions, he deemed it harmful only when it extended beyond building a society for the common good to creating sub-groups that thrived at others' expense. A sound government, he believed, was essential to curb humanity's inherent evil, yet it required vigilant oversight to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a significantly limited Federal government, endowed with no more rights or powers than those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. Taylor was aware that a sprawling Federal government could be costly and prone to tyranny. However, he also recognized that a straightforward, literal interpretation of the Constitution could be perilous without considering the framers' intentions, as it could easily lead to corruption. Moreover, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the genuine foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly depicted the nation as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single unified entity.",
            "As I looked down, my mind blankly absorbed the scene before me. Without emotion or sound, I observed with a practiced awareness that analyzed but refused to connect the object of my gaze to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind almost faster than I could recognize them. My consciousness functioned so seamlessly that it felt as if I had no real thoughts of my own, just a fluid experience of what I was observing.\n\nOnce, upon the recommendation of an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, I had wanted to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from the basics of a pencil to the brain's process of interpreting lines. One technique it taught was to frame any picture the artist wanted to study, transforming a detailed scene—like a fruit bowl on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a more manageable image, simply a bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nIn that moment, staring down at the bowl, I couldn't mentally project that artist’s frame. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance artists showcased a spectrum of colors. If I were to aspire to an artistic perspective, before me lay the beginnings of my picture, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nWith fingertips touching my chosen tool of creativity, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, shaping what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled smoothly and clearly. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My muscles tightened, jerked, and twitched more urgently on the second try as my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown package remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet spaced apart, a green tie uncomfortably knotted at my neck, I frowned at the unwelcome bundle of processed material left as a message for those cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some introspective moments, my hand moved to the right, grabbed the end of the toilet paper, and wrapped itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers are facing a troubling reality on the roads. Multiple factors converge to create a dangerous scenario for America's youngest motorists. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience also plays a significant role, leading to more fatal collisions, increased instances of rollovers, speeding, and vehicles veering off the road.\n\nTeenagers are particularly vulnerable when driving with their friends—a common occurrence that anyone familiar with teenage behavior can attest to. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo enhance the safety of young drivers, states like California have implemented provisional licenses, which restrict driving hours and prohibit having other minors as passengers. However, these provisional licenses are, in my view, merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically unprepared to manage the dangers and duties of driving adequately. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 years old might be too young for a standard driver's license. His research, as reported by USA Today, indicates that individuals under the age of 19-20 often seek thrills, which could justify delaying the age at which one can drive until this behavior stabilizes. Continuing to grant licenses to teenagers could perpetuate the occurrence of fatal accidents, with potentially severe consequences as more young drivers take to the roads.\n\nAddressing this problem through legislation would be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver’s education to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be permitted to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before a full license is granted, and a certain number of driving practice hours would still be necessary. These hours could be based on existing state requirements, such as California's current mandate of six hours of behind-the-wheel instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that teen driver fatality rates are a nationwide concern, a unified, national legislative approach would be a logical and, I believe, effective strategy for safeguarding young drivers across the country. This proposal is not entirely new.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it offers a concise explanation of the disorder. Following this, it delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it concludes with suggestions on how educators in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, (C)APD is defined as the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the underlying neurobiologic activity that facilitates this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). In essence, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory information correctly. Individuals with CAPD can hear adequately, hence are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" The challenge lies in the brain's ability to interpret sounds, such as distinguishing words or separating conversations from ambient noise, which doesn't function as expected.\n\nThe origins of what is now known as CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during the study of children with communication disorders. In 1954, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began creating tests for these children. Later, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the Central Auditory Nervous System (CANS) related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself through various symptoms: individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially; have trouble distinguishing between multiple \"acoustic events\"; fail to recognize sound patterns; have difficulty detecting changes in speech, such as identifying sarcasm through vocal tone; experience one sound being masked by another; lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues in a meaningful way for action; and find it challenging to discern the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the individual must undergo a screening involving \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be carried out by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and other professionals using diverse measures to evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This might include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, particularly how the individual reacts to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool or test with a high success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests present the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking them to discern specific items, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "As I embark on my journey in social work, I aim to carve out a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on aiding children who have faced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethical principles, dedication to enhancing interpersonal relationships, and a commitment to my own professional growth to maintain competence. These values are not only integral to social work but also hold personal significance for me.\n\nFrom an early age, I was drawn to helping others, although I was uncertain about the specific career path I should pursue. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their issues and resorting to inadequate coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations prompted me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Despite this, I remained undecided about my career direction and chose to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had contacted the police regarding his parents. I decided to visit the boy's parents to offer any assistance I could. I discreetly expressed my concerns to the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as legal action couldn't assist the teenager. When I engaged the parents in conversation, they appeared anxious and made excuses for their son’s \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for what they termed \"simple\" family disputes. This experience solidified my resolve to pursue a career in social work to support children caught in similar family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value in social work. Society often claims to value the individual and mourns those lost, yet the societal notion of the \"individual\" often adheres to outdated traditions rather than true uniqueness. If we truly mourn lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I value my individuality and resist imposing limitations on myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I stood against social injustice in various ways: by dyeing my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, participating in the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance (GSBA), and opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am a staunch advocate for social justice and will continue to challenge social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks in understanding insomnia. The biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. On the other hand, the Sociocultural models consider the influence of environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. This review examines insomnia through these lenses, analyzing various studies to clarify and elaborate on each model. The paper also evaluates the research findings, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental disorders, or those associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional sleep disorder categories may arise from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves trouble with initiating or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia entails difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve sleep-related behavioral or physiological anomalies. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders involve difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily concentrates on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders examines genetic, hereditary, and physiological factors. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. Research involving mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are key in sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. The sociocultural aspect suggests that inherited phenotypes affecting this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, potentially impacting various life areas such as education, work, and routine activities requiring concentration.",
            "Having been a student at University Park for two and a half years, or four and a half semesters, I've faced the challenges of navigating campus, as many others do. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm at East Halls, nearly the farthest point east on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, located near the center of campus, often took up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather was as unpredictable as it frequently is in State College. I spoke with an alum who is only a few years older and discovered that not long ago, large expanses of unused land separated East Halls from the rest of the university. Nowadays, that space hosts sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus keeps growing, moving around becomes increasingly challenging. How can we improve mobility? On a college campus, bicycles are the answer. However, owning a bike is not enough; students must use them, and the campus should accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend who started biking again after a long break. He wondered why he had ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are fantastic; for some time, it wasn't trendy to ride one, but it's the best way to get around.” Beyond being beneficial for health, cycling is an efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some effort, you can travel 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike was my smartest decision this year. My classes in the Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, can be reached in just 5 minutes on my bike if I push myself. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building but not always easy to traverse, whether biking or walking. While walking has its merits, I simply don't have the time. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable way to reach classes, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. That adds up to over two and a half hours each week, not including time spent walking to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley explores the looming dangers of technology intertwined with the capitalistic framework by crafting a dystopian universe. Within this society, the collective is prioritized over the individual, and people are systematically conditioned from birth to chase immediate gratification above everything else. The inhabitants are portrayed as mere chess pieces in a grander scheme, bound to a singular ideology governed by the World Controller. When viewed through the prism of Marxist theory, the novel highlights Huxley's concerns about the evolution of these systems. The frequent use of Marxist concepts, such as homogeny and reification, underscores the notion that Huxley's work critiques the flaws in the economic trends of his era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which suggests that ordinary citizens are kept in the dark about their true relationships with other social classes, being more focused on their personal gain. This stems from the ideological control exerted over the proletariat and common workers, a theme evident in the conditioning of the populace in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack true autonomy; their compulsion to consume and indulge is amplified through sleep-teaching, all under the manipulation of the World Controller. The idea of hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is clearly depicted here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, essentially endorsing an ideology that upholds the capitalist and consumerist framework. Meanwhile, the upper classes, despite having the capacity to recognize this system, largely do nothing about it; few, like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes significantly illustrate the perceived oppression inherent in capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are nonexistent. The novel seemingly avoids differentiating characters, even among the main ones, who lack depth. Perhaps Huxley implies that the convergence of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love is absent, as are the extremes of any particular emotion; instead, interactions remain shallow, depicted through men’s remarks about women focusing on physical traits (such as their 'pneumatic' quality) and women's unreserved discussions about their encounters. Additionally, each class's acceptance of their position within the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering adherence to their roles within the community signifies Marxist views on the proletariat, who are misled into believing their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, comply, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A significant topic of intense debate in the class was whether Islam should be considered a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more pertinent today than it was in the past. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I have noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile outlook on Islam and extremists to a more tolerant perspective in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Borac Obama, who has Muslim roots in his family, would have emerged.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me because it seems to contradict what I know about his history. From my understanding and previous learning, I believed Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, taking over tribes and compelling them to adopt the faith. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, who humbled himself and was eventually sought out by people who recognized the 'truth' in his teachings.\n\nFurthermore, there are notable parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. A prominent example is when he supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This writing style leads me to conclude that the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who needed no validation but simply lived truthfully and performed miracles. This portrayal seems to diminish the significance of the life and miracles of Jesus Christ. It feels as though they are attempting to appropriate aspects of Jesus's life and character through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, the biography contains numerous stories that appear to aim at providing evidence of people 'on their own' converting to Islam. However, many of these stories are recounted from a third-party perspective, with the author narrating what was heard from others. This approach, rather than confirming the stories' authenticity, seems to make them appear more dubious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts seem to challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble leader, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to prominence.",
            "After Jesus' life, Christian thought developed in ways that diverged significantly from what he originally taught and believed. If we examine this historical journey broadly, there's a noticeable drift of Christianity away from its foundational roots. In the modern world, there's a growing consciousness and a remarkable progressive inclination. Although traditionalists persist and resist any ideas beyond their inherited teachings, they might not hold enough sway to shape the entire landscape. Among Christians, historical awareness is set to expand greatly in the years ahead. An aspiration will emerge to separate the doctrines that accumulated over time from the true intentions of Christianity’s founder. It could take many decades or even centuries, but the result will be unavoidable: a significant shift in the course of Christian history, moving back toward its original form. A burgeoning movement will progressively peel back layers of doctrine, as if time were rewinding, until only the core concepts Jesus presented to humanity remain, before others influenced the narrative. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, many will be inspired to worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering solely to his teachings. The church as an institution will endure to guide this transformation. Yet, as theological perspectives reset, the broad diversity within Christianity will contract, leading to increasing homogeneity in beliefs and practices. Across regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will observe growing similarities instead of differences. Human history is marked by significant reversions. For instance, Christians once faced persecution by the Roman Empire, only for it to later become a Christian institution. In our own nation's history, we transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming reversion will unfold within Christianity, unraveling history to find its source and minimizing diversity along the way. It’s important to highlight that this process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what transpired after Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back far enough, we encounter Judaism as the theological bedrock of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish community was not unified; it was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" reveals the inherent tendency of humans to be selfish and greedy. The narrative illustrates how individuals often prioritize their personal gain above all else, neglecting those beneath them. This theme is prominently depicted through the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding and enhancing their enterprises, showing little concern for the people or things adversely affected by their progress. Upton Sinclair's work captures this notion vividly: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair paints a picture of the environmental devastation caused by industrial pollution, highlighting the owners' disregard for the harm inflicted on people and animals. They remain indifferent to the smoke pouring from the factories and the waste runoff surrounding Packingtown.\n\nMoreover, the welfare of their employees is of little importance to these owners and managers, whose main goal is profit maximization. Sinclair describes this cutthroat environment as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long hours and face abrupt layoffs without notice or support in finding new employment. During the period \"The Jungle\" is set, worker protections were virtually nonexistent, enabling managers and owners to exploit laborers in harsh conditions. Although not explicitly stated in the book, those who toiled in Packingtown faced grueling conditions both at work and in their living situations. Support systems for workers were absent, and unions often exploited rather than aided them. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe regarded \"Dream-Land\" as one of his more accomplished poems. In this work, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. Virgil's use of \"Thulé\" referred to a distant island north of Britain, seen by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, it's worth noting that Poe's interest in German literature could have influenced his usage. \n\nThis particular reference is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his analysis titled \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes the similarities between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe may have been emulating Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was a renowned author known for the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after receiving a goblet from his wife, falls into despair and heavy drinking following her death. Ultimately, he bequeaths his belongings to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the ocean before dying. The similarities between the king's melancholy in \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's depiction in \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works, notably using \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's dark and desolate landscape, haunted by memories of deceased friends, painting a world devoid of color. These themes resonate with Goethe's poem, where the king, having lost his wife, is overcome with loneliness and despair. It's as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" steps directly into the world of Goethe's creation.\n\nGoethe was a prominent literary figure, and Poe would likely have been familiar with his works, not least through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe's acknowledgment of Tennyson's influence suggests that he would have encountered Goethe's writings through the numerous reproductions that followed their original publication.",
            "Under the legal framework in California, the question arises whether a customer who was injured due to slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket could potentially receive punitive damages if it is demonstrated that the store manager acted with malice, given that he was notified twice about the spill but did not address it for thirty minutes because he was having dinner. It seems unlikely that a judge would outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To support a claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must show evidence that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer might argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential danger of ignoring a spill, especially since multiple customers had sustained injuries from similar incidents in the months leading up to Palmer’s accident. Despite this, Martin did not ensure the spill was cleaned up. The argument that Martin's conduct was despicable is less compelling but still justifiable given the fact that there had been six slip-and-fall accidents in 2009, yet Martin did not take necessary steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Mr. Martin, who responded similarly. At 5:30 pm on that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a significant back injury. Before Palmer's fall, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and we are considering whether to submit a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as behavior intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and performed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as per § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct to be malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" according to Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From a young age, she always sensed a certain emptiness within her. This longing, elusive and unfulfilled, began around age 14 as she transitioned into her teenage years. By the time she reached 17, the feeling persisted, but she had realized it was a person she sought, not an object. However, no boy captivated her interest. Though some were drawn to her and awkwardly tried to win her over, none sparked her curiosity. She often pondered this unusual situation, wondering what could cause such an anomaly in a teenage girl. Despite years of reflection and various theories, no satisfying answer emerged, leaving her to navigate life with an ongoing sense of curiosity about her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents exemplified calmness, rarely engaging in disputes with each other or with their daughter. When disagreements did arise, they usually centered on her desire for independence and self-expression. Though she contrasted her parents' placid nature with her vibrant and engaging personality, it made her well-liked, coupled with her innate kindness.\n\nYet today was anything but tranquil. As she moved through the house seeking new creative inspirations, her mother’s sudden scream from the kitchen shattered the peace. Panic-stricken, she rushed in, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in distress, muttering \"Ow\" between labored breaths. Kneeling beside her, she placed a supportive hand on her mother. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were strained, and her daughter could see the severe pain in her mother's eyes. \"Okay Mom, guide me on how to help you,\" she replied. With her mother’s direction, she relied on her strength training to lift her into the car, laying her gently in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital greeted her with the familiar smells of antiseptic and anxiety, but her focus remained solely on her mother’s wellbeing. Swiftly, she carried her into the building, urgently seeking medical assistance. A cluster of concerned staff gathered, one of them quickly bringing a gurney to lay her mother upon. They whisked her away for immediate care, leaving the daughter in a state of anxious waiting.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a step stool while attempting to reach a vase on the top shelf of their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is an adapted form of the traditional Med diet, distinguished by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but incorporating fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permissible.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, an intervention trial indicated that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and enhancing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Earlier research did not specifically concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, researchers monitored 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The study spanned from 1984 to 2004, during which the authors calculated an aMed diet score on six occasions using self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs”) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation checks. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were deemed “probable” and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. Factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin usage, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and provide a better representation of long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments for confounding factors (elements that might skew results) were made by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, correlated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease-related deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign reads: Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nStanding solitary on a street corner, Ellen Page, the renowned actress from *Juno*, holds a piece of cardboard above her head with the alarming message inscribed in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a nation in Southeast Asia governed by a repressive military junta that seized control via a coup d’état in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed the first public demonstrations in a decade. These protests, led predominantly by Burmese monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the hue of the monks' robes. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly permitted the monks to assemble peacefully, but as the protests gained public interest, the situation quickly deteriorated into violent clashes between the military junta and the monks. The military began raiding monasteries nationwide, and foreign journalists were detained, with a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fatally shot during a protest on September 27, 2007. Although the official death toll is recorded as 13, Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nSuch events are not new. While these are recent instances of global atrocities, the ambition of governments to suppress dissent and exert absolute control over their citizens has persisted throughout history. In ancient Rome, emperors claimed divine selection for absolute authority over societal facets. Japanese emperors are deemed divine, destined to lead their people to prosperity through the creation of inventions like Motorola cell phones and practices like hara-kiri. Meanwhile, our then-president, George W. Bush, reportedly held weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republic Party.\n\nNoteworthy examples of such actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered against governmental authoritarianism. The death toll estimates from this event vary significantly, with official Chinese reports citing 200-300 fatalities, while the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically exterminated Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ stands as an extreme instance, where countless individuals of Jewish descent were persecuted and executed over several years across numerous nations.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his exceptional talent in shaping his orchestra's sound. While his piano presence is often understated in the selections for this assignment, Ellington's genius as a composer shines through in his ability to create intricate and complex compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. He laid the groundwork for soloists to freely improvise, while also crafting meticulously orchestrated pieces that showcased the distinct styles of his musicians, effectively bringing out musical themes. This approach allowed him to emphasize the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in cohesive and original sounds tailored to each piece. Ellington's profound understanding of individual players' sounds and how they harmonized within an evolving ensemble led to some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its discussion of Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's skill in adding vocal texture and color without relying on lyrics, and it demonstrates his knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a hallmark of his career. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece consists of six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Features a call-and-response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic tone that shifts to a rougher sound by the end.  \nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the melody and highlights several extended blue notes.  \nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.  \nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.  \nChorus 5: The climactic chorus with reeds leading the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.  \nChorus 6: Returns to the first chorus structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, acting as an instrument.  \nTag: Concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color in this piece is a stylistic trait seen throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his mastery of tight orchestration with his keen sense for tonal color. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal qualities of Miley's playing and the instrumental characteristics of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington effectively employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key figure in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What factors influence the way organisms evolve? Are there limitations or constraints shaping the direction of evolutionary changes? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to study general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, considering both their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the genus Prunum, alongside experimental studies, can help unveil the mechanisms driving the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental transformations. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal forms. These parameters were fed into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By modeling hypothetical shell forms, we aimed to interpret the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. The findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary processes in this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a structure resembling a tube that spirals through 360 degrees over time. These spirals or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which encircle an imaginary central axis. This axis extends through the shell's central column, termed the columella. The growth rate of the whorls can differ, with each whorl separated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last one, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the base is at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer with the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nTo count the whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has witnessed little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. While the nation appears to be on track with several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the expected progress in child and maternal health remains significantly lacking to meet the 2015 targets. The underlying causes of these deficiencies are explored below, suggesting a focus on reinforcing the healthcare system rather than just implementing program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen some advancement in the presence of skilled health professionals at births, with 72% of deliveries now attended by such personnel. However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who are not equipped to handle medical complications during childbirth, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. Hence, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, indicating that substantial efforts are still necessary. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the number of children under five with diarrhea being treated by health professionals. Although data on postnatal care remains sparse, it's evident that this area requires attention due to low nationwide rates.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than anticipated, hovering around 4%. This figure highlights another significant concern. In urban regions, the c-section rate is 7%, whereas in rural areas, it is a mere 2%, revealing disparities in healthcare access. Health services are evidently more accessible in urban areas. Another access issue pertains to vertical equity, with a 27% disparity in service use between the poorest and wealthiest segments. This indicates that poorer individuals face greater obstacles in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: should Indonesia focus on service-specific approaches or bolster the overall health system, irrespective of pre and post-natal care? Program-specific strategies are appealing since they offer precise, manageable goals and often yield quicker results. However, there are significant drawbacks. Prioritizing one health sector can divert funds from others and concentrate human resources in that area, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Additionally, operating multiple parallel programs can lead to service duplication and uncoordinated efforts, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded to encompass a vast array of genres, making it challenging to catalog them comprehensively. Adding to this complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres within popular music over the last four decades. Its expressiveness is evident in its wide emotional range, often gravitating towards darker themes. Its diversity became apparent early on, as enthusiasts recognized its inherent flexibility and began crafting their own sub-genres, which in turn spawned further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented with specialized niches that defining heavy metal itself has become a challenge. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet, like all music forms, it originated from a specific point. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend what constitutes the metal movement and why it transcends being merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by its affinity for darkness. It can be described as music that embodies excess—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatrical flair. There is less primitivism, and more technical skill; musicians in metal bands are often highly proficient, and this expertise is reflected in their music. Moreover, metal is—perhaps unsurprisingly—deeply intertwined with drug culture. The psychedelic drug wave of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental and otherworldly music productions, with artists using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, contrasting sharply with the lighter emotional tones of much popular music. Subsequent generations of metal bands have drawn inspiration from these dark, visceral elements, reminiscent of the Romantic Era’s influence. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter illustrate the movement's signature darkness.\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter reveal the darker aspects of the Beatles, reflecting a tumultuous, perhaps drug-influenced experience. This track is often regarded as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a similarly heavy and dark Rolling Stones track. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity, which is why the song was included on The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist painters began their exploration of dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, both in his art and ambitions. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only portrays a woman entranced by the wonders of a dreamt landscape but also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations as an artist. From the onset of his career, Rousseau longed for recognition and admiration from fellow artists and the art community. However, achieving this dream was fraught with internal conflict. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle—whether to conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished or to remain true to his unique creative voice and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream through this lens, one must understand Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed moderate prosperity (Shattuck 47). He received no formal art education and worked for the French municipal toll service, often mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector, until he was forty (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving only a daughter named Julia, plunged Rousseau into deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting as a means of renewal and comfort. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized rural life, Rousseau’s work reflected the aspirations and experiences of the average person of his social standing.\n\nRousseau’s yearning for acceptance in the art world is understandable when considered in context. Untrained and starting his art career later in life, he competed alongside other acclaimed modern artists. Only after years of effort did Rousseau start gaining recognition, around the time Matisse was establishing his reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes the contrast between the two; while Matisse feared falling into artistic clichés, Rousseau sought to create works conventional enough to earn him a place in the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous intellectuals have suggested a close relationship between ethics and aesthetics, and between truth and beauty. I am convinced that there is a fundamental reason behind this connection. As John Keats eloquently puts it in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, yet our appreciation of ethics and aesthetics, as Keats hints, seems to arise without formal instruction. Both areas attempt to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely aims to explain what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action moral, rather than establishing rules for creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nCritiquing art or morality often falls short of capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural significance, but these don't fully explain why it is considered great art. When someone speaks about a favorite artwork or piece of literature, they often say, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed analysis. I believe that art and morals cannot be entirely distilled into a list of qualities. As Flannery O'Connor remarks, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Even with a thorough description of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I see the same quality in ethics. As Wittgenstein points out, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this indefinable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that the close relationship between morality and art stems from their profound impact on us at a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. We experience them deeply, yet cannot fully explain them. This connection is particularly strong in the realm of literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a formidable and cohesive nation with a diverse cultural identity stretching from the Alpine region of Munich to the Baltic city of Kiel. This cultural essence is discernible from Cologne on the Rhine River, traversing central Germany to Dresden on the Elbe. Given its distinctive heritage, it is no surprise that contemporary Germany emerged from a mix of various origins and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral roots of the German people lie in Germania, though the name's origins are debated among experts. According to Tacitus, the name came from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and engaged the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and encountered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine with dubious intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had vanquished (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin remains uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue. In his initial account of these wars, Caesar observes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name derives from the weapon they wielded, a spear known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” implying that the Germans were boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman chronicler Tacitus, in his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” which explored the Germans' origins, noted, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not initially. They ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally embarked on land campaigns but typically returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and offering their services as soldiers in the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the notion that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these facades to avoid losing their true identity. However, ceasing such deception poses a significant challenge, as it may lead to feelings of isolation. Consequently, individuals are faced with the choice between safeguarding their own identity or maintaining relationships with those around them. Some may react indifferently to the revelation of deception, yet others may feel deeply offended by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of deception related to gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises several questions, most notably, the reason behind the disguise. Why would someone abandon their identity to assume the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is clearly a measure of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels compelled to masquerade as a man for protection against potential threats. Her strategy is successful, but it also isolates her from other women, depriving her of crucial support. To complicate matters further, her disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and, consequently, falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, she must navigate her repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nAlthough this might be seen as a progressive perspective, contemporary readers may view \"Twelfth Night\" as showcasing how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Certain scenes suggest that these characters might possess unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because she believes Cesario is male, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems improbable, as Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia appears to mock those of his era who judge others based solely on appearances. This is evident in Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually regarding Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often remembered for its harshness, particularly concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it is important to recognize that no colonial empire can be fully described with such a broad statement. The German colonial empire displayed a wide range of policies and governing styles, differing as much as its geographic spread. Educational offerings across the colonies were similarly varied. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a substantial number of well-educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories were also lauded by writers of the period.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established state schools and contributed significantly to the education of the local population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. The government did, however, allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans within the colony, developing a system of state schools and providing greater support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies saw a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" A variety of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the different experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and highlighting recent research on the perceptions of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere exists an extensive body of literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these texts are in German and were composed in the early 20th century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. The primary goal of these early works was to detail the characteristics of educational systems within these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse by offering comparative studies of education across various German colonies and providing more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. Notably, Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa directly addresses the topic of this paper. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nRelative to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa enjoyed a somewhat temperate climate, although much of the area is characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored the relatively favorable living conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once experienced a prolonged and challenging period of rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States launched an attack on Mexico, resulting in a victory that allowed it to annex Texas and the American Southwest. Several other conflicts occurred between these two nations, finally subsiding just before the outbreak of the First World War. The root of the rivalry lay in significant disagreements over religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a substantial clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is reminiscent of numerous other countries that have long-standing rivalries with their neighbors. Nations that share borders often encounter conflicting interests, which can give rise to adversarial positions. The case of the United States and Mexico mirrors many enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have maintained rivalrous relationships with it, in contrast to other Latin American countries that have generally enjoyed amicable relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences significantly contributed to the divide between the United States and Mexico, a challenge that has troubled many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) argues that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which combined ideological struggle with competition over perceived vital interests, the conflict between the United States and Mexico was rooted in religious disparities rather than political structures. This mutual distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which the United States and Mexico inherited from their colonial predecessors, complicating efforts to establish friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent problem until both the United States and Mexico deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) notes that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and ultimately concluded as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years back, my life took an unexpected turn when I was suddenly disabled by a condition I had never heard of before.\n\nAt that time, I was working as a nurse. I had selected this career driven by a deep-seated need for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always have a job; people will always need medical care,\" was a constant refrain throughout my teen years and beyond. So, even though my aspirations leaned towards becoming a scientist or a journalist—or perhaps both—I opted for a career in nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, without any savings, and unable to work. I remain disabled to this day, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability benefits, I find myself with virtually nothing to claim as my own. I manage to get by, but each day is a battle that challenges my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life feels stable anymore, but there is one truth I hold onto: without the support of my family and a few close friends, I would not have survived these years, regardless of my personal strength. When true calamity hits, you certainly don't feel very strong.\n\nThe reality is that life will always throw unexpected challenges our way, both big and small. No level of preparation can guarantee security, as some obstacles are simply too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nI firmly believe that in the U.S., we need to move away from relying solely on the government, which is showing signs of decay and instability. Instead, I would prefer to see Americans fostering trust and cooperation—supporting one another and being willing to seek support—rather than each person independently preparing for doomsday scenarios.\n\nWhile the U.S. Conservatives praise \"rugged individualism\" as a cornerstone of our nation's history, the truth is that our ancestors persevered through tough times not because of individualism but through compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Those who traveled in wagon trains across the Rockies didn't succeed by going it alone.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. I've assembled a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. I have multiple flashlights, a variety of batteries, an abundance of candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources to maintain a small farm and preserve your own food, go for it. It's a wise choice, as is investing in a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut as you prepare, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the distant past, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later become known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he chose to leave behind worldly life and achieved enlightenment. His teachings became the foundation of Buddhism, with the most traditional branch being Theravada Buddhism. This religion has a history spanning approximately 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in various places, such as Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious meaning despite not being part of Buddha's original teachings. These variations range from ceremonial practices to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, as well as both supportive and challenging forces.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently utilized in this discussion. The idea of internal versus external forces is one of these. Internal forces are those that originate from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces refer to influences from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or seeks to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. Conversely, a benign force does not aim to either harm or assist the Buddhist community, although it might inadvertently do so. These terms will be referenced multiple times throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the fundamental aspects of the religion—the essential doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, or \"three baskets,\" of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka comprises all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical elements of Buddhism. These metaphysical ideas include concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By understanding these concepts, one can end Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. With the cessation of Sansara comes the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts: refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks adhere to many more rules of discipline. The most essential doctrinal aspect in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, acknowledging that life involves suffering; second, that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Negotiations are deeply influenced by cultural factors. Culture isn't just defined by what it is, but also by what it isn't, and what it represents. It's not a monolithic or singular entity, and it's certainly not uniform. Broad statements like \"Russians are always stubborn\" or \"Japanese people are invariably accommodating\" are overly simplistic and fail to capture the complexity of cultures. Understanding cultural generalizations can be useful, but it's more beneficial for a negotiator to grasp the importance of culture in the context of the negotiation and how cultural attitudes can impact discussions. When encountering a foreign culture, people naturally make comparisons to their own culture.\n\nUnderstanding a different culture or mindset may involve exploring its history and acknowledging its biases. Instead of judging or trying to alter a culture, one should accept it and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, especially when one's bargaining position is weaker. If negotiating in unfamiliar territory, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance discussions.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture doesn't only apply to national or international contexts. Companies often develop their own corporate cultures. For example, some prioritize long work hours, while others opt for more flexible schedules. Corporate culture can manifest in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others limit it to company-approved initiatives. The diversity of American corporate culture, varying from one company to another and even within regions of the same company, illustrates the range of perspectives within a societal culture. Other cultures might seem less stratified and more uniform to outsiders, but this exterior similarity invites a deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is crucial because they explain the motivations behind a culture. For instance, in cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superiors. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that values aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle. Considering these general characteristics is vital before entering negotiations. However, it's also beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The phrase, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and sets the stage for St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This idea also resonates with Thomas Aquinas, another thinker we'll explore. Both philosophers defend the same concept, prompting us to evaluate which argument is more compelling. For the sake of brevity and focus, let's assume that they both accurately believe in the existence of the Biblical God. Introducing a different concept of a deity would derail a proper comparison of their arguments, which are centered around a specific notion of God. Despite the merit in their points, neither philosopher offers a comprehensive justification for belief in God.\n\nTo delve into this, we begin by examining St. Anselm's core argument. Anselm's approach emphasizes understanding through faith, suggesting that proof of God can be found internally. He posits that since God exists within our understanding, it is impossible to truly conceive of His nonexistence. Although his explanation can be intricate and occasionally ambiguous, the essence is that the evidence for God resides in our minds. Anselm implies that truth about God is inherently known within us, rendering external evidence unnecessary. This notion of accepting what lacks undeniable empirical evidence is often termed faith in Christian literature.\n\nContrastingly, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be established purely through reason and empirical evidence, without any reliance on faith. This perspective is advantageous for evangelism, a significant aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of individuals solely through logical persuasion. Aquinas outlines five logical proofs for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Through these, he illustrates that the necessity of God can be demonstrated logically. Just as one can infer the characteristics and existence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, Aquinas argues that logic alone can reveal God's existence.",
            "Authors frequently employ various techniques to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers towards significant topics. These techniques can vary in their effectiveness. In his novel, \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a range of these methods. Occasionally, Fitzgerald combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create a distinct atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he imbues symbols with meaning and uses them for similar effects. One particular method he employs involves the use of colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns particular meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, later using these associations to evoke certain feelings related to important objects or themes.\n\nThe associations Fitzgerald creates with the colors white/gray symbolize uniformity, with white connoting a sense of elegance and higher social standing, while gray suggests age and fading. This symbolism is established early in the novel through frequent references to these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted as being \"in white\" (8)—a color choice that extends to various characters and settings: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom wears a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). A notable deviation from this is observed during Gatsby's party when \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines the meanings of these colors by applying them to mundane or commonplace subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the attendees of Gatsby's parties are reduced to \"gray names\" (61) on Nick’s schedule, and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a metaphor for uniformity (28). Additionally, ordinary people or places are often described using white or gray: Jordan and Daisy share a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes is populated with \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), a child on the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to denote unimportance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period with little mention of these colors, Daisy is depicted as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her less as a unique character and more as a standardized element that Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald continues to apply this technique in relation to Daisy, reinforcing the impression of her as a uniform presence. For instance, there is mention of the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18), and she wears a \"white\" (115) dress prior to the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

These farms present an opportunity for landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, allowing for recreational use and educational farm tours that can generate revenue.\n\nWhile organic farming can fill a profitable niche, it also contributes to increased biodiversity in the area by avoiding chemical use, which benefits both plants and wildlife. However, organic farming can incur higher costs compared to conventional farming due to its labor-intensive nature. This includes managing pests and weeds without chemicals and fertilizing the soil naturally. Losses can be greater, and small organic farms lack the economies of scale that larger operations have. Additionally, practices beneficial to wildlife but not directly related to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth, may result in increased labor costs. These are some of the reasons a landowner might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe land selected for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It consists of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Although still under review, the plan currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, such as burrowing owls, are declining and may be listed soon.\n\nThis land has a history of being inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 1800s. It was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the years. To explore the options available to a small farmer for cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly operations, I chose a property from a real estate website and researched potential government programs. I identified an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound and enduring, marked by a spectrum of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. This unique bond allows brothers to understand each other in ways that no one else can, seeing a part of themselves reflected in their sibling. It's during moments of crisis that the true essence of this bond is revealed, for better or worse, accompanied by significant consequences. A deep understanding of these emotions involves grappling with the outcomes they produce. When a brother meets his sibling's gaze and sees a reflection of himself, he perceives his true nature, beyond what others see. It is through actions and their repercussions that one's true character is unveiled. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored by two brothers, accompanied by the tumultuous emotions it evokes. Against a backdrop of vividly depicted scenery, the boys embark on a journey destined for failure. This journey culminates in a scene where bitter disappointment collides with overwhelming pride, leaving only one brother surviving. The theme unfolds through direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which reveals the protagonist's complex emotions and his perception of his environment.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by one dominant emotion: pride. From his initial outings with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He longed for a brother he could teach skills such as holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines at Old Woman Swamp. He envisioned a brother who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing or sit with him atop the great pine behind the barn. However, given Doodle's fragile heart condition, these dreams were unattainable. Doodle's survival was uncertain from birth, and participation in intense physical activities was nearly impossible. For the protagonist, brimming with youthful fantasies, the realization of these limitations was devastating. At one point, he even contemplates ending Doodle's life by smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would entertain such a thought? Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that fills him with hope, indicating that his resolve was not as strong as it seemed. Deep down, there was an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from its earliest forms to the state-of-the-art advancements we see today, the metaphors used to describe the brain have similarly progressed. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, later a book, and finally, a computer. While studying the brain, it's crucial to recognize that these metaphors have their limits and may lead us to incorrect assumptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory data undergoes continuous transformation through the brain's algorithms using both bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when observing a picture of a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing gathers basic details like color, orientation, and edge detection—where color shifts markedly over a small area—to conclude that a box is present. Top-down processing then leverages decisions from earlier bottom-up steps to expedite recognition of the box. In this scenario, top-down processing might assist in identifying the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped gap in the white field.\n\nOnce information reaches a certain level of processing, an attention filter assesses its importance and determines which cognitive processes should receive it. For example, though your brain processes every blade of grass as you glance at your shoes, an effective attention filter stops you from noticing each one separately. Conversely, you might notice your name being spoken even amidst a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, with attention repeatedly shaping the outcomes.\n\nBefore the brain can process information, it needs to be stored. Memory is categorized into sensory, working, and long-term types. Initially, information is encoded, and there are encoding methods specific to each sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on structure, which pertains to the appearance of a printed word, phonemically, which relates to the sound of the word, or semantically, which involves the word's meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by electrical signals cycling through a specific series of neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained within the structure of certain proteins.\n\nVarious models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized in the brain. Some are derived from how humans retrieve memories, others from computer science, and some from neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interlinked based on their relationships. In such a network, \"chair\" might connect to \"table,\" which could link to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a severe financial crisis that led to a significant rise in unemployment, a collapse in the housing market, and left many major corporations in disarray. This recession continues today, prompting us to ask: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it in the future? Essentially, the crisis stemmed from shortsighted and reckless political decisions that compelled banks and financial institutions to issue subprime loans within an underdeveloped financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to underwrite and bundle these mortgages into complex financial products like CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves lacking sufficient capital reserves, spreading turmoil through the repackaged mortgages they had sold and affecting the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought re-election by boosting his popularity. In pursuit of this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, which contributed to the conditions for the subprime crisis that emerged seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the administration to expand loan access to low and moderate-income individuals, while also being pressed by shareholders to sustain its impressive profit growth. Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As outlined earlier and as Holmes anticipated, poorly conceived lending practices inevitably led to economic collapse.\n\nNumerous factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the intricate nature of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations were extensively utilized in the years leading up to the crisis, further entangling various economic sectors with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets becoming heavily leveraged in real estate, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert into commercial banks under strict regulatory oversight. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your tale where you spread your creative wings and soar, captivating everyone with your enchanting, if not mesmerizing, prose. Or perhaps it's the moment where your audience drifts off or clicks away, muttering your name in frustration. Dr. Merlin has been known to yell at her screen when she finds herself drowning in an overload of details, and not even in an enjoyable way.\n\nExposition can be a tricky companion.\n\nMy dear readers are already familiar with the classic writing advice, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself lost in sprawling text where nothing unfolds, or worse, everything does. Exposition is the mischievous little voice that insists on getting the backstory out of the way to reach the exciting parts (not to be mixed up with the other voice demanding the author share every tiny detail of each character's past).\n\nExposition involves telling the audience what occurred, usually in straightforward prose. In movies, exposition occurs when a character delivers a lengthy monologue of information like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In novels, it's the author doing the explaining.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you're informed that the heroine met her love at a specific time and place, they had a grand wedding, and her husband was tragically killed before her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to span only two pages, with both characters speaking just a couple of lines each. You would anticipate the author to delve into the husband's personality, illustrating through his words and actions how deeply he cherishes his wife, and expect the heroine to demonstrate in various ways how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the story later explicitly states this was true). A well-crafted introduction to the husband's character would engage you emotionally with his fate and offer insight into the heroine's character: what drew her to him, the depth of their connection, and hints about her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his loss with her, thereby strengthening your connection to the heroine.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance on the bare bones of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your task to provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues on*) There is often a temptation to gloss over certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he once served in the Air Force, now works as a night manager at a gas station, has been married twice without children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which aired live, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The leading story focused on a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Although his wife's name wasn't mentioned, his mugshot was shown, and he appeared quite menacing. As the story was still unfolding, they only spent about two minutes on it, mentioning that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I felt that they dedicated an appropriate amount of time to this report.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was in critical condition; at that time, no arrests had been made, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating. This segment seemed brief, possibly because it involved a crime in a predominantly black neighborhood or a minority victim. I have noticed over the years that crimes involving minorities often receive less media attention. When a white individual becomes a victim, the media tends to focus heavily on the story; however, when a minority is involved, it may not even make the news.\n\nAnother story detailed a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They provided information on where they believed the incident occurred, determining it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe following story discussed the forecasted rain and thunderstorms set for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures staying in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was relatively short, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThey also reported on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. He was around six feet tall and weighed approximately 150 pounds. It seemed they spent an unusual amount of time highlighting his race and skin tone.\n\nAnother piece was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas. He was found guilty of conspiring to transport large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Curiously, instead of stating he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300 months,\" perhaps to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund, or ETF, is a type of security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, but it offers greater flexibility as it is traded like a stock on an exchange. ETFs provide the diversification benefits of an index fund while allowing for the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase just a single share in any transaction. Despite these enticing benefits, ETFs typically have much lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, there are some drawbacks, such as the requirement to pay a commission on any ETF trades, akin to stock transactions. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast range of funds available. Despite the clear advantages, it’s always wise for astute investors to scrutinize whether these benefits, like diversification, truly exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will assess the ETF IHF and compare it to the top 10 holdings within the ETF to determine if owning a single ETF provides benefits comparable to owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and whether there are better configurations of these stocks that could yield a more optimal return or Sharpe ratio.\n\nTo evaluate the ETF efficiently, we focus only on the top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF’s total assets. Listed below are these top ten holdings and their respective percentages of the total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use their current percentage of assets, adjusted to 100%, to calculate each stock’s contribution to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted solely of these ten stocks in the proportions allocated by the ETF. The Beta and return calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart demonstrates that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it remains possible that the means of these two portfolios may not differ significantly from each other statistically.\n\nTo assess whether these portfolios are statistically distinct, we calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks, adjusting it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Examining Figure 17, it’s evident that the number of commuter log submissions plummeted significantly during the third month of the initiative, which was somewhat discouraging. The reasons for this decline are not entirely clear. One factor could be the arrival of winter at a New England campus, as fewer people choose to commute by bike or on foot during colder months, potentially contributing to the downturn. December is also the end of the fall semester, a time when students and staff are preoccupied with finalizing academic responsibilities and grades, possibly leading them to overlook the commuter log. Furthermore, December heralds the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to be present on campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which may also explain the lower log numbers. However, this doesn’t fully account for the lack of submissions in February. It’s plausible that any project of this kind might start with enthusiasm that naturally wanes over time. To counteract this, we initiated Carpool Challenge Week in March, a campaign aimed at revitalizing interest, which successfully increased log submissions. Thus, one major challenge we faced was sustaining project momentum amid both a natural decline in interest and the specific issues posed by holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education.\n\nAnother obstacle for this initiative, as with any alternative commuting project, is that individuals often cherish the autonomy and convenience of driving their own vehicles, a concept deeply rooted in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, such as gift certificates for local eateries, coffee shops, massage therapists, the independent bookstore, and even some larger chain stores. It’s intriguing to consider how more substantial prizes, like a quality bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, might have impacted engagement. Such prizes could have alleviated the decline in participation experienced during the project. The nature of the prizes remained constant throughout the project. However, if the prize value had increased over time, it might have bolstered participation. Initially, the gift cards were quite effective, but if we had announced the inclusion of bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, it’s conceivable that participation and engagement would have risen rather than fallen.",
            "As I explored the early Edison films available in the Library of Congress, I focused on viewing all fifteen trick films made between 1895 and 1901. These films often utilize inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis primarily aimed at outlining the stylistic elements typical to most trick films while also identifying unique evolutionary features in a few later productions. Generally, trick films from the turn of the century are characterized by their reliance on set-bound scenes within a frontal proscenium, lack of camera movement, use of long and medium shots, and a one shot = one film approach. However, some early twentieth-century films began to challenge these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is the use of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movements of figures or objects. This setup, rooted in theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic performances, was prevalent in early cinema. One limitation of this stage-like arrangement is that characters in trick films usually only move laterally, rather than towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal plane. Even when they exit the frame, the camera stays put.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also results in a predominance of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are notably absent from any of the trick films in the Edison collection. This mirrors theatrical and vaudevillian traditions where audiences viewed the entire performance within the confines of the stage's borders. Like many early films, actors in these trick films remain in the middle ground, never advancing towards the camera, hence the absence of close-ups.\n\nTypically, early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot constitutes a film. This restricts most trick films to a duration of about a minute or less, based on the frames per second. It also constrains their dramatic or narrative potential, as they mostly depict brief vaudeville-like tricks, such as magic acts, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storytelling. However, it's important to note that in trick films, what appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience doesn’t always equate to a single physical shot. A \"shot\" might actually consist of several segments stitched together to create an illusion, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as one continuous shot by viewers.",
            "In his book, The Rise of the Gothic Novel, Ian Watt refers to the classic \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" highlighting its paradoxical nature. This literary style has faced both criticism and acclaim, with some dismissing it for lacking depth while others praise it for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, often credited as the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blends elements of \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge this new genre, introducing a fresh approach to storytelling. Walpole incorporates traditional theatrical components along with a 'modern' portrayal of nature found in contemporary novels, branding his work as \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic drama, architecture, and customs. Even during the release of The Castle of Otranto, the term \"gothic\" described a variety of cultures, styles, and eras, often perceived as outdated or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" social and literary \"advancements.\" The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which offers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, has allowed the Gothic to endure over time, appearing both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its original publication. \n\nA key theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, which involved training a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the initial Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds significant value for Gothic authors due to its representation of the archetypal knight—courageous, honorable, and capable—and the perceived absence of such ideals in their society, particularly noted by Walpole. By employing chivalric ideals and customs, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future shift from Gothic to Romantic, and serves as a means to critique and potentially improve the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was amid political turmoil and concerned about the future. Immersed in politics and facing (arguably) unfair criticism, he might have begun to consider, albeit implicitly, that the morality and inherent \"goodness\" of people from the gothic era had somehow been lost in contemporary society. This notion is evident in several characters, notably Frederic. Before even meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he exemplifies many chivalric qualities. He is depicted as a prince who has endured suffering, been deeply affected by tragedy, and is believed to have been slain by infidels. The portrayal of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, exaggerated, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the journey of goods from the moment a customer places an order, through the stages of raw materials, supply, production, and distribution, until they reach the end consumer. This concept was introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver. He explained the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing supply chain activities to quickly and efficiently meet customer needs. The supply chain is built around six core components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to deliver optimal customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain is production, serving as the cornerstone for the entire process. It involves determining the timing, reasons, locations, and methods of production. Managers must be attuned to customer preferences, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends—the primary indicator of consumer demands. With a clear understanding of market needs, managers can decide on the products to manufacture and their quantities. Subsequently, they choose the optimal production site, considering factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Once the production location is set, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Precision in every aspect of production is crucial, as any oversight can result in significant time and financial losses. During my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, I observed that both companies employed structured processes and guidelines for all business operations, from employee uniforms to shipment receivables, ensuring smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe next critical component is supply, which involves strategic decision-making to establish a facility's core competencies and potential outsourcing partnerships. A company might operate several production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must identify the most suitable division for different product processes, occasionally opting to outsource to enhance speed. This strategy, known as velocity, aims to deliver quality and flexibility while minimizing or maintaining low costs.",
            "Victorian novels are often recognized for their meticulous detail and focus on the aristocracy of the time. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while set in the Victorian era, deviate from this pattern. These novels incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which is uncommon for the period's literature. This approach enhances the depth of the characters by providing greater insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“In a sudden rush, a multitude of confusing thoughts overwhelmed his mind. It was as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were in a heated argument: for their very words echoed in his ears; and when he managed to focus on himself, … he realized he was speaking to them…. Abruptly, he was jolted by the sound of gunfire; shouts and cries filled the air; lights flashed before his eyes, and everything was noise and chaos, as an unseen force whisked him away swiftly. Amidst these rapid visions, there was a vague, troubling sense of pain, which tormented him constantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth novels frequently use elements of mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though each case serves different purposes. In Oliver Twist, such occurrences often offer insights into Oliver’s inner struggles, his pain, and his awareness of the reality around him. When Oliver's shooting is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences it vividly as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. This passage highlights the lack of control Oliver has over the unfolding events and the precarious state of his health, as illustrated by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself engulfs him; his senses are dulled, and he fails to notice the “unseen hand” carrying him away. He relives his despair, no longer shocked by pain, as it has become a constant, more associated with fear than surprise. This raises the question of who is responsible for his misfortune, as it is certainly not Oliver himself. The shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances, as he cannot even attempt to influence the outcome, even with his life at stake. This passage suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and affecting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it could be assumed Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own survival.\n\n“The day slipped by – day! It vanished as quickly as it arrived – and night descended once more; a night both long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A few years back, I found myself working in an after-school program dedicated to tutoring young students in elementary school. My primary aim was to assist them in overcoming challenges in various subjects, though I was particularly adept in English and reading. One day, an instructor asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in the third or fourth grade and was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; while he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, others seemed to completely baffle him. It was odd. Adrian was of Latino heritage, that much I could tell, but his spoken English was impeccable. We continued to face difficulties until the day I encountered his mother. I was supervising a few students who hadn’t gone on a field trip when she arrived. She spoke no English, only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it suddenly became clear to me: Adrian’s issue wasn’t reading itself but his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. I’m not sure how much my realization helped him, but I certainly hope he’s improved since then.\n\nThis story highlights the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly in California. It serves as a reminder that these challenges aren’t always as visible as they might seem. Even a child who is fluent in spoken English can face substantial hurdles when it comes to reading. We can all acknowledge this problem exists, but the question remains: how do we address it? For Adrian, the solution was relatively straightforward: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations. However, for many children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. A single answer doesn’t suffice. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, ESL classes—none of these alone can solve the issue. The solution lies in integrating all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent concept, beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research suggests that children in two-way bilingual education programs often outperform their peers academically. There is considerable apprehension surrounding this idea, with concerns that it might be a misuse of resources or that the majority of students will not benefit. However, this perception is incorrect. If we were to make such programs the norm rather than the exception, all students could gain from them. But how should we implement this? Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be neither reasonable nor realistic. Nonetheless, there is no reason we cannot employ bilingual aides or tutors to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some are guided to Sunday school to explore this notion, others to Temple, while some embark on an inner quest for answers. Many people readily embrace the religious beliefs handed down by their parents. Yet, there are those who completely reject these beliefs, unwilling to accept anything beyond their own egocentric reality. At times, we might adopt a set of values only to later replace them with another. Regardless of the path we take, we strive to define a part of ourselves through our individual spiritual perspectives. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness into illumination.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he replied, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain as it drummed on the tin roof above, smoking cigarettes together. The rainwater overflowed from the gutters, submerging the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain with a look that seemed part searching, part reminiscing. Over the past few months, he had grown thinner, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame. His hair had thinned more than I remembered, too. He continued to look into the rain, avoiding my gaze. I felt isolated, scared, and found it difficult to express how much I would miss him because acknowledging it would make it too real for both of us. I embraced him, then sat back down, moving my chair closer to his, and joined him in watching the rain fall in the June twilight.\n\nMy father died that December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't lessened his suffering but had merely extended his life by a few months beyond the doctors' predictions; I couldn't find meaning in prolonging his pain. I questioned what kind of God could allow this to happen. Alone at night, I offered no prayers. If God existed, I felt He had ceased listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his transition from this life to the next. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that had given me life come to an end. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. I knew him better than anyone else did, even his family, and I believed he wouldn't have wanted his only child to be a witness to his death. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate of Republicanism during his time. Although primarily an agriculturist, his involvement in agriculture and his short stint in politics shaped him into a person recognized for his commitment and forthrightness regarding individual liberty and governance. His strong belief in an agrarian lifestyle heavily influenced his perspectives on governmental issues. His efforts to sustain and promote what he viewed as the most noble of professions significantly shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nJohn Taylor envisioned the United States as having a remarkable opportunity to establish an exemplary system, free from any pre-existing native traditions that might impede the founders of the government. This, he argued, paved the way for a system of self-governance. Taylor was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals and how these rights were interconnected; the denial of one would undermine them all, diminishing their overall value. He argued that these rights should remain untouchable by the government. He opposed the notion that in a \"state of nature,\" those with physical strength and cunning intelligence would prevail, asserting that such dynamics should not exist in a civilized society.\n\nTaylor believed that crafting an ideal society required a government that acknowledged both the inherent good and evil within humans. He held strong convictions on the duality of morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and deter capitalism, suggesting that a government grounded in these principles would operate justly, despite being led by greed and self-interest. While he saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions, he deemed it harmful only when it extended beyond building a society for the common good to creating sub-groups that thrived at others' expense. A sound government, he believed, was essential to curb humanity's inherent evil, yet it required vigilant oversight to prevent the incorporation of harmful principles.\n\nLike many staunch Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He sought a significantly limited Federal government, endowed with no more rights or powers than those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. Taylor was aware that a sprawling Federal government could be costly and prone to tyranny. However, he also recognized that a straightforward, literal interpretation of the Constitution could be perilous without considering the framers' intentions, as it could easily lead to corruption. Moreover, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the genuine foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly depicted the nation as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single unified entity.",
            "As I looked down, my mind blankly absorbed the scene before me. Without emotion or sound, I observed with a practiced awareness that analyzed but refused to connect the object of my gaze to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind almost faster than I could recognize them. My consciousness functioned so seamlessly that it felt as if I had no real thoughts of my own, just a fluid experience of what I was observing.\n\nOnce, upon the recommendation of an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art instruction book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since the age of six, I had wanted to learn drawing, and this book covered everything from the basics of a pencil to the brain's process of interpreting lines. One technique it taught was to frame any picture the artist wanted to study, transforming a detailed scene—like a fruit bowl on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room—into a more manageable image, simply a bowl of fruit on a flat surface.\n\nIn that moment, staring down at the bowl, I couldn't mentally project that artist’s frame. Overwhelmed and awestruck, I could only stand and marvel. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance artists showcased a spectrum of colors. If I were to aspire to an artistic perspective, before me lay the beginnings of my picture, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nWith fingertips touching my chosen tool of creativity, muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand moved through space, shaping what could have been my most creative moment. Water swirled smoothly and clearly. Bits of matter broke away and vanished. My muscles tightened, jerked, and twitched more urgently on the second try as my hand struck the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown package remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet spaced apart, a green tie uncomfortably knotted at my neck, I frowned at the unwelcome bundle of processed material left as a message for those cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some introspective moments, my hand moved to the right, grabbed the end of the toilet paper, and wrapped itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young drivers are facing a troubling reality on the roads. Multiple factors converge to create a dangerous scenario for America's youngest motorists. According to the National Institutes of Health, one part of the issue is the fact that the teenage brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience also plays a significant role, leading to more fatal collisions, increased instances of rollovers, speeding, and vehicles veering off the road.\n\nTeenagers are particularly vulnerable when driving with their friends—a common occurrence that anyone familiar with teenage behavior can attest to. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nTo enhance the safety of young drivers, states like California have implemented provisional licenses, which restrict driving hours and prohibit having other minors as passengers. However, these provisional licenses are, in my view, merely temporary fixes. The core issue is that young drivers, as a demographic, are statistically unprepared to manage the dangers and duties of driving adequately. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 years old might be too young for a standard driver's license. His research, as reported by USA Today, indicates that individuals under the age of 19-20 often seek thrills, which could justify delaying the age at which one can drive until this behavior stabilizes. Continuing to grant licenses to teenagers could perpetuate the occurrence of fatal accidents, with potentially severe consequences as more young drivers take to the roads.\n\nAddressing this problem through legislation would be relatively simple. Schools could still offer driver’s education to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be permitted to drive. A provisional permit could be issued before a full license is granted, and a certain number of driving practice hours would still be necessary. These hours could be based on existing state requirements, such as California's current mandate of six hours of behind-the-wheel instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that teen driver fatality rates are a nationwide concern, a unified, national legislative approach would be a logical and, I believe, effective strategy for safeguarding young drivers across the country. This proposal is not entirely new.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it offers a concise explanation of the disorder. Following this, it delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it concludes with suggestions on how educators in mainstream classrooms can support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. Specifically, (C)APD is defined as the perceptual processing of auditory data within the CNS and the underlying neurobiologic activity that facilitates this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). In essence, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to process auditory information correctly. Individuals with CAPD can hear adequately, hence are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" The challenge lies in the brain's ability to interpret sounds, such as distinguishing words or separating conversations from ambient noise, which doesn't function as expected.\n\nThe origins of what is now known as CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), during the study of children with communication disorders. In 1954, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began creating tests for these children. Later, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the Central Auditory Nervous System (CANS) related to dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further spurred research into children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself through various symptoms: individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially; have trouble distinguishing between multiple \"acoustic events\"; fail to recognize sound patterns; have difficulty detecting changes in speech, such as identifying sarcasm through vocal tone; experience one sound being masked by another; lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues in a meaningful way for action; and find it challenging to discern the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, the individual must undergo a screening involving \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function,\" which can be carried out by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and other professionals using diverse measures to evaluate auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This might include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, particularly how the individual reacts to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool or test with a high success rate, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many tests present the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli, asking them to discern specific items, such as a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "As I embark on my journey in social work, I aim to carve out a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on aiding children who have faced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in distress. The values I bring to the social work profession include service, respect, ethical principles, dedication to enhancing interpersonal relationships, and a commitment to my own professional growth to maintain competence. These values are not only integral to social work but also hold personal significance for me.\n\nFrom an early age, I was drawn to helping others, although I was uncertain about the specific career path I should pursue. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their issues and resorting to inadequate coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations prompted me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Despite this, I remained undecided about my career direction and chose to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. She explained that he was there to escape his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had contacted the police regarding his parents. I decided to visit the boy's parents to offer any assistance I could. I discreetly expressed my concerns to the police and mentioned my recent Psychology degree from Piedmont College. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as legal action couldn't assist the teenager. When I engaged the parents in conversation, they appeared anxious and made excuses for their son’s \"manipulative\" behavior in seeking outside help for what they termed \"simple\" family disputes. This experience solidified my resolve to pursue a career in social work to support children caught in similar family conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another crucial value in social work. Society often claims to value the individual and mourns those lost, yet the societal notion of the \"individual\" often adheres to outdated traditions rather than true uniqueness. If we truly mourn lost individuals, why do we strive for conformity? I value my individuality and resist imposing limitations on myself to fit in. Throughout high school and college, I stood against social injustice in various ways: by dyeing my hair unconventional colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, participating in the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance (GSBA), and opposing racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am a staunch advocate for social justice and will continue to challenge social injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks in understanding insomnia. The biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical health factors. On the other hand, the Sociocultural models consider the influence of environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic conditions. This review examines insomnia through these lenses, analyzing various studies to clarify and elaborate on each model. The paper also evaluates the research findings, highlighting their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental disorders, or those associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, while sleep disorders related to mental disorders are connected to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional sleep disorder categories may arise from medical conditions or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves trouble with initiating or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia entails difficulty staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy is characterized by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. While Dyssomnias focus on sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias involve sleep-related behavioral or physiological anomalies. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders involve difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily concentrates on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders examines genetic, hereditary, and physiological factors. Neurons containing orexin in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in sleep-wake regulation. Research involving mice demonstrated that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are key in sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These results suggest that mouse models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could impair sleep quality without medication. The sociocultural aspect suggests that inherited phenotypes affecting this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, potentially impacting various life areas such as education, work, and routine activities requiring concentration.",
            "Having been a student at University Park for two and a half years, or four and a half semesters, I've faced the challenges of navigating campus, as many others do. During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm at East Halls, nearly the farthest point east on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in distant buildings like Willard, located near the center of campus, often took up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather was as unpredictable as it frequently is in State College. I spoke with an alum who is only a few years older and discovered that not long ago, large expanses of unused land separated East Halls from the rest of the university. Nowadays, that space hosts sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and is surrounded by apartments. As the campus keeps growing, moving around becomes increasingly challenging. How can we improve mobility? On a college campus, bicycles are the answer. However, owning a bike is not enough; students must use them, and the campus should accommodate cyclists.\n\nI recently spoke to a friend who started biking again after a long break. He wondered why he had ever stopped, saying, “Bikes are fantastic; for some time, it wasn't trendy to ride one, but it's the best way to get around.” Beyond being beneficial for health, cycling is an efficient mode of transportation. With a bowl of oatmeal and some effort, you can travel 30 miles or more. Like many students, I now live off-campus, as far from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike was my smartest decision this year. My classes in the Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, can be reached in just 5 minutes on my bike if I push myself. The only issue is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to the Thomas building but not always easy to traverse, whether biking or walking. While walking has its merits, I simply don't have the time. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable way to reach classes, adding 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. That adds up to over two and a half hours each week, not including time spent walking to other classes and appointments. That's more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley explores the looming dangers of technology intertwined with the capitalistic framework by crafting a dystopian universe. Within this society, the collective is prioritized over the individual, and people are systematically conditioned from birth to chase immediate gratification above everything else. The inhabitants are portrayed as mere chess pieces in a grander scheme, bound to a singular ideology governed by the World Controller. When viewed through the prism of Marxist theory, the novel highlights Huxley's concerns about the evolution of these systems. The frequent use of Marxist concepts, such as homogeny and reification, underscores the notion that Huxley's work critiques the flaws in the economic trends of his era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which suggests that ordinary citizens are kept in the dark about their true relationships with other social classes, being more focused on their personal gain. This stems from the ideological control exerted over the proletariat and common workers, a theme evident in the conditioning of the populace in \"Brave New World.\" The lower classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack true autonomy; their compulsion to consume and indulge is amplified through sleep-teaching, all under the manipulation of the World Controller. The idea of hegemony, where social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is clearly depicted here. The lower classes remain oblivious to this manipulation, essentially endorsing an ideology that upholds the capitalist and consumerist framework. Meanwhile, the upper classes, despite having the capacity to recognize this system, largely do nothing about it; few, like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes significantly illustrate the perceived oppression inherent in capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are nonexistent. The novel seemingly avoids differentiating characters, even among the main ones, who lack depth. Perhaps Huxley implies that the convergence of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love is absent, as are the extremes of any particular emotion; instead, interactions remain shallow, depicted through men’s remarks about women focusing on physical traits (such as their 'pneumatic' quality) and women's unreserved discussions about their encounters. Additionally, each class's acceptance of their position within the hierarchy reflects the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unwavering adherence to their roles within the community signifies Marxist views on the proletariat, who are misled into believing their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, comply, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A significant topic of intense debate in the class was whether Islam should be considered a hostile religion. I believe this question is even more pertinent today than it was in the past. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I have noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile outlook on Islam and extremists to a more tolerant perspective in America. Back in 2001, it seemed unlikely that a presidential candidate with a name like Borac Obama, who has Muslim roots in his family, would have emerged.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me because it seems to contradict what I know about his history. From my understanding and previous learning, I believed Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, taking over tribes and compelling them to adopt the faith. However, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, who humbled himself and was eventually sought out by people who recognized the 'truth' in his teachings.\n\nFurthermore, there are notable parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. A prominent example is when he supposedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This writing style leads me to conclude that the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet who needed no validation but simply lived truthfully and performed miracles. This portrayal seems to diminish the significance of the life and miracles of Jesus Christ. It feels as though they are attempting to appropriate aspects of Jesus's life and character through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, the biography contains numerous stories that appear to aim at providing evidence of people 'on their own' converting to Islam. However, many of these stories are recounted from a third-party perspective, with the author narrating what was heard from others. This approach, rather than confirming the stories' authenticity, seems to make them appear more dubious to me.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who was humble, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts seem to challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble leader, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true historical context of Muhammad's rise to prominence.",
            "After Jesus' life, Christian thought developed in ways that diverged significantly from what he originally taught and believed. If we examine this historical journey broadly, there's a noticeable drift of Christianity away from its foundational roots. In the modern world, there's a growing consciousness and a remarkable progressive inclination. Although traditionalists persist and resist any ideas beyond their inherited teachings, they might not hold enough sway to shape the entire landscape. Among Christians, historical awareness is set to expand greatly in the years ahead. An aspiration will emerge to separate the doctrines that accumulated over time from the true intentions of Christianity’s founder. It could take many decades or even centuries, but the result will be unavoidable: a significant shift in the course of Christian history, moving back toward its original form. A burgeoning movement will progressively peel back layers of doctrine, as if time were rewinding, until only the core concepts Jesus presented to humanity remain, before others influenced the narrative. As this trend spreads across the United States and Europe, many will be inspired to worship as if living during Jesus' time, adhering solely to his teachings. The church as an institution will endure to guide this transformation. Yet, as theological perspectives reset, the broad diversity within Christianity will contract, leading to increasing homogeneity in beliefs and practices. Across regions, denominations, and various divisions, we will observe growing similarities instead of differences. Human history is marked by significant reversions. For instance, Christians once faced persecution by the Roman Empire, only for it to later become a Christian institution. In our own nation's history, we transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The forthcoming reversion will unfold within Christianity, unraveling history to find its source and minimizing diversity along the way. It’s important to highlight that this process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus’ words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what transpired after Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back far enough, we encounter Judaism as the theological bedrock of Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the faith. The Jewish community was not unified; it was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of ordinary people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" reveals the inherent tendency of humans to be selfish and greedy. The narrative illustrates how individuals often prioritize their personal gain above all else, neglecting those beneath them. This theme is prominently depicted through the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding and enhancing their enterprises, showing little concern for the people or things adversely affected by their progress. Upton Sinclair's work captures this notion vividly: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair paints a picture of the environmental devastation caused by industrial pollution, highlighting the owners' disregard for the harm inflicted on people and animals. They remain indifferent to the smoke pouring from the factories and the waste runoff surrounding Packingtown.\n\nMoreover, the welfare of their employees is of little importance to these owners and managers, whose main goal is profit maximization. Sinclair describes this cutthroat environment as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long hours and face abrupt layoffs without notice or support in finding new employment. During the period \"The Jungle\" is set, worker protections were virtually nonexistent, enabling managers and owners to exploit laborers in harsh conditions. Although not explicitly stated in the book, those who toiled in Packingtown faced grueling conditions both at work and in their living situations. Support systems for workers were absent, and unions often exploited rather than aided them. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe regarded \"Dream-Land\" as one of his more accomplished poems. In this work, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. Virgil's use of \"Thulé\" referred to a distant island north of Britain, seen by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil indeed used this term, it's worth noting that Poe's interest in German literature could have influenced his usage. \n\nThis particular reference is significant as it highlights Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his analysis titled \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes the similarities between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe may have been emulating Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was a renowned author known for the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust\" is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates the story of a king who, after receiving a goblet from his wife, falls into despair and heavy drinking following her death. Ultimately, he bequeaths his belongings to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the ocean before dying. The similarities between the king's melancholy in \"The King of Thulé\" and Poe's depiction in \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible reflection of Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H. P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions Thule twice in his collected works, notably using \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's dark and desolate landscape, haunted by memories of deceased friends, painting a world devoid of color. These themes resonate with Goethe's poem, where the king, having lost his wife, is overcome with loneliness and despair. It's as if the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" steps directly into the world of Goethe's creation.\n\nGoethe was a prominent literary figure, and Poe would likely have been familiar with his works, not least through his admiration for Tennyson. Poe's acknowledgment of Tennyson's influence suggests that he would have encountered Goethe's writings through the numerous reproductions that followed their original publication.",
            "Under the legal framework in California, the question arises whether a customer who was injured due to slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket could potentially receive punitive damages if it is demonstrated that the store manager acted with malice, given that he was notified twice about the spill but did not address it for thirty minutes because he was having dinner. It seems unlikely that a judge would outright dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To support a claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must show evidence that the defendant acted with willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their actions could cause, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer might argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential danger of ignoring a spill, especially since multiple customers had sustained injuries from similar incidents in the months leading up to Palmer’s accident. Despite this, Martin did not ensure the spill was cleaned up. The argument that Martin's conduct was despicable is less compelling but still justifiable given the fact that there had been six slip-and-fall accidents in 2009, yet Martin did not take necessary steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a worker at D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Mr. Martin, who responded similarly. At 5:30 pm on that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a significant back injury. Before Palmer's fall, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and we are considering whether to submit a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as behavior intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and performed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,\" as per § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct to be malicious when done with a conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" according to Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "From a young age, she always sensed a certain emptiness within her. This longing, elusive and unfulfilled, began around age 14 as she transitioned into her teenage years. By the time she reached 17, the feeling persisted, but she had realized it was a person she sought, not an object. However, no boy captivated her interest. Though some were drawn to her and awkwardly tried to win her over, none sparked her curiosity. She often pondered this unusual situation, wondering what could cause such an anomaly in a teenage girl. Despite years of reflection and various theories, no satisfying answer emerged, leaving her to navigate life with an ongoing sense of curiosity about her desires.\n\nLife at home was typically serene. Her parents exemplified calmness, rarely engaging in disputes with each other or with their daughter. When disagreements did arise, they usually centered on her desire for independence and self-expression. Though she contrasted her parents' placid nature with her vibrant and engaging personality, it made her well-liked, coupled with her innate kindness.\n\nYet today was anything but tranquil. As she moved through the house seeking new creative inspirations, her mother’s sudden scream from the kitchen shattered the peace. Panic-stricken, she rushed in, calling out, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" She found her mother on the floor, clearly in distress, muttering \"Ow\" between labored breaths. Kneeling beside her, she placed a supportive hand on her mother. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were strained, and her daughter could see the severe pain in her mother's eyes. \"Okay Mom, guide me on how to help you,\" she replied. With her mother’s direction, she relied on her strength training to lift her into the car, laying her gently in the back, and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital greeted her with the familiar smells of antiseptic and anxiety, but her focus remained solely on her mother’s wellbeing. Swiftly, she carried her into the building, urgently seeking medical assistance. A cluster of concerned staff gathered, one of them quickly bringing a gurney to lay her mother upon. They whisked her away for immediate care, leaving the daughter in a state of anxious waiting.\n\nHer mother had taken a tumble from a step stool while attempting to reach a vase on the top shelf of their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke mortality. The aMed diet is an adapted form of the traditional Med diet, distinguished by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but incorporating fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in preference to saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permissible.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, an intervention trial indicated that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and enhancing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. Earlier research did not specifically concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, researchers monitored 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of CVD or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The study spanned from 1984 to 2004, during which the authors calculated an aMed diet score on six occasions using self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs”) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation checks. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were deemed “probable” and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions falling into this category. Factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin usage, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormones were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for an individual and provide a better representation of long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments for confounding factors (elements that might skew results) were made by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, correlated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease-related deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign reads: Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nStanding solitary on a street corner, Ellen Page, the renowned actress from *Juno*, holds a piece of cardboard above her head with the alarming message inscribed in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a nation in Southeast Asia governed by a repressive military junta that seized control via a coup d’état in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed the first public demonstrations in a decade. These protests, led predominantly by Burmese monks, became known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" named after the hue of the monks' robes. Initially, the Burmese government reluctantly permitted the monks to assemble peacefully, but as the protests gained public interest, the situation quickly deteriorated into violent clashes between the military junta and the monks. The military began raiding monasteries nationwide, and foreign journalists were detained, with a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fatally shot during a protest on September 27, 2007. Although the official death toll is recorded as 13, Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, claimed, \"Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.\"\n\nSuch events are not new. While these are recent instances of global atrocities, the ambition of governments to suppress dissent and exert absolute control over their citizens has persisted throughout history. In ancient Rome, emperors claimed divine selection for absolute authority over societal facets. Japanese emperors are deemed divine, destined to lead their people to prosperity through the creation of inventions like Motorola cell phones and practices like hara-kiri. Meanwhile, our then-president, George W. Bush, reportedly held weekly calls with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subgroup of the Republic Party.\n\nNoteworthy examples of such actions include the Tiananmen Square protests on June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered against governmental authoritarianism. The death toll estimates from this event vary significantly, with official Chinese reports citing 200-300 fatalities, while the Chinese Red Cross reported 2,000-3,000 deaths. Another example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, systematically exterminated Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’ stands as an extreme instance, where countless individuals of Jewish descent were persecuted and executed over several years across numerous nations.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz largely stems from his long career and his exceptional talent in shaping his orchestra's sound. While his piano presence is often understated in the selections for this assignment, Ellington's genius as a composer shines through in his ability to create intricate and complex compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. He laid the groundwork for soloists to freely improvise, while also crafting meticulously orchestrated pieces that showcased the distinct styles of his musicians, effectively bringing out musical themes. This approach allowed him to emphasize the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in cohesive and original sounds tailored to each piece. Ellington's profound understanding of individual players' sounds and how they harmonized within an evolving ensemble led to some of the most groundbreaking and brilliant works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in its discussion of Ellington's sound and innovation, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's skill in adding vocal texture and color without relying on lyrics, and it demonstrates his knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a hallmark of his career. The slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece consists of six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Features a call-and-response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic tone that shifts to a rougher sound by the end.  \nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the melody and highlights several extended blue notes.  \nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.  \nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.  \nChorus 5: The climactic chorus with reeds leading the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.  \nChorus 6: Returns to the first chorus structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds, where the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, acting as an instrument.  \nTag: Concludes with a brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tonal color in this piece is a stylistic trait seen throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington merges his mastery of tight orchestration with his keen sense for tonal color. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing uses the vocal qualities of Miley's playing and the instrumental characteristics of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, as Ellington effectively employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key figure in Ellington's orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "What factors influence the way organisms evolve? Are there limitations or constraints shaping the direction of evolutionary changes? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" and this observation holds true today. Recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to study general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, considering both their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the genus Prunum, alongside experimental studies, can help unveil the mechanisms driving the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental transformations. We utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters, which were then used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal forms. These parameters were fed into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By modeling hypothetical shell forms, we aimed to interpret the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. The findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary processes in this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a structure resembling a tube that spirals through 360 degrees over time. These spirals or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which encircle an imaginary central axis. This axis extends through the shell's central column, termed the columella. The growth rate of the whorls can differ, with each whorl separated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last one, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the base is at the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is the apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer with the apex pointing upwards.)\n\nTo count the whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identify where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell formation process.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has witnessed little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. While the nation appears to be on track with several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the expected progress in child and maternal health remains significantly lacking to meet the 2015 targets. The underlying causes of these deficiencies are explored below, suggesting a focus on reinforcing the healthcare system rather than just implementing program-specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen some advancement in the presence of skilled health professionals at births, with 72% of deliveries now attended by such personnel. However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who are not equipped to handle medical complications during childbirth, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. Hence, the progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, indicating that substantial efforts are still necessary. Moreover, there has been a reduction in the number of children under five with diarrhea being treated by health professionals. Although data on postnatal care remains sparse, it's evident that this area requires attention due to low nationwide rates.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than anticipated, hovering around 4%. This figure highlights another significant concern. In urban regions, the c-section rate is 7%, whereas in rural areas, it is a mere 2%, revealing disparities in healthcare access. Health services are evidently more accessible in urban areas. Another access issue pertains to vertical equity, with a 27% disparity in service use between the poorest and wealthiest segments. This indicates that poorer individuals face greater obstacles in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: should Indonesia focus on service-specific approaches or bolster the overall health system, irrespective of pre and post-natal care? Program-specific strategies are appealing since they offer precise, manageable goals and often yield quicker results. However, there are significant drawbacks. Prioritizing one health sector can divert funds from others and concentrate human resources in that area, as seen with international funding for HIV/AIDS impacting the family planning sector. Additionally, operating multiple parallel programs can lead to service duplication and uncoordinated efforts, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and funding.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded to encompass a vast array of genres, making it challenging to catalog them comprehensively. Adding to this complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive genres within popular music over the last four decades. Its expressiveness is evident in its wide emotional range, often gravitating towards darker themes. Its diversity became apparent early on, as enthusiasts recognized its inherent flexibility and began crafting their own sub-genres, which in turn spawned further sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented with specialized niches that defining heavy metal itself has become a challenge. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet, like all music forms, it originated from a specific point. To truly grasp the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend what constitutes the metal movement and why it transcends being merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal is a movement characterized by its affinity for darkness. It can be described as music that embodies excess—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatrical flair. There is less primitivism, and more technical skill; musicians in metal bands are often highly proficient, and this expertise is reflected in their music. Moreover, metal is—perhaps unsurprisingly—deeply intertwined with drug culture. The psychedelic drug wave of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental and otherworldly music productions, with artists using drugs as a catalyst for their creativity. Metal's dark, visceral qualities were a novel addition to the music scene, contrasting sharply with the lighter emotional tones of much popular music. Subsequent generations of metal bands have drawn inspiration from these dark, visceral elements, reminiscent of the Romantic Era’s influence. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter illustrate the movement's signature darkness.\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter reveal the darker aspects of the Beatles, reflecting a tumultuous, perhaps drug-influenced experience. This track is often regarded as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a similarly heavy and dark Rolling Stones track. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity, which is why the song was included on The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist painters began their exploration of dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was crafting his own visions, both in his art and ambitions. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only portrays a woman entranced by the wonders of a dreamt landscape but also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations as an artist. From the onset of his career, Rousseau longed for recognition and admiration from fellow artists and the art community. However, achieving this dream was fraught with internal conflict. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle—whether to conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance in the critical art world he cherished or to remain true to his unique creative voice and forge his own path.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream through this lens, one must understand Rousseau’s background. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed moderate prosperity (Shattuck 47). He received no formal art education and worked for the French municipal toll service, often mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector, until he was forty (Shattuck 46). The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving only a daughter named Julia, plunged Rousseau into deep sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace, he turned to painting as a means of renewal and comfort. Unlike his contemporaries who often romanticized rural life, Rousseau’s work reflected the aspirations and experiences of the average person of his social standing.\n\nRousseau’s yearning for acceptance in the art world is understandable when considered in context. Untrained and starting his art career later in life, he competed alongside other acclaimed modern artists. Only after years of effort did Rousseau start gaining recognition, around the time Matisse was establishing his reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes the contrast between the two; while Matisse feared falling into artistic clichés, Rousseau sought to create works conventional enough to earn him a place in the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous intellectuals have suggested a close relationship between ethics and aesthetics, and between truth and beauty. I am convinced that there is a fundamental reason behind this connection. As John Keats eloquently puts it in “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience, yet our appreciation of ethics and aesthetics, as Keats hints, seems to arise without formal instruction. Both areas attempt to describe rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty largely aims to explain what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action moral, rather than establishing rules for creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nCritiquing art or morality often falls short of capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural significance, but these don't fully explain why it is considered great art. When someone speaks about a favorite artwork or piece of literature, they often say, “There's just something about it,” before offering a more detailed analysis. I believe that art and morals cannot be entirely distilled into a list of qualities. As Flannery O'Connor remarks, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” Even with a thorough description of a literary work, something transcendent remains. I see the same quality in ethics. As Wittgenstein points out, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this indefinable quality, this je ne sais quoi, is the most compelling aspect of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe that the close relationship between morality and art stems from their profound impact on us at a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. We experience them deeply, yet cannot fully explain them. This connection is particularly strong in the realm of literature. As McKean states, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a formidable and cohesive nation with a diverse cultural identity stretching from the Alpine region of Munich to the Baltic city of Kiel. This cultural essence is discernible from Cologne on the Rhine River, traversing central Germany to Dresden on the Elbe. Given its distinctive heritage, it is no surprise that contemporary Germany emerged from a mix of various origins and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral roots of the German people lie in Germania, though the name's origins are debated among experts. According to Tacitus, the name came from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and engaged the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he subdued the Gauls and encountered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine with dubious intentions. He adopted this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had vanquished (the Gauls) and those he had not. While the origin remains uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish tongue. In his initial account of these wars, Caesar observes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others suggest the name derives from the weapon they wielded, a spear known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” implying that the Germans were boisterous. (Names of Germany)\n\nThe early Roman chronicler Tacitus, in his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” which explored the Germans' origins, noted, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nAnd who would abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not initially. They ventured into Germania for resources and occasionally embarked on land campaigns but typically returned to their vast empire. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and offering their services as soldiers in the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the notion that while disguises can effectively sustain prolonged deception, ultimately, one must abandon these facades to avoid losing their true identity. However, ceasing such deception poses a significant challenge, as it may lead to feelings of isolation. Consequently, individuals are faced with the choice between safeguarding their own identity or maintaining relationships with those around them. Some may react indifferently to the revelation of deception, yet others may feel deeply offended by the deceit.\n\nThe theme of deception related to gender role reversal is particularly complex, as it raises several questions, most notably, the reason behind the disguise. Why would someone abandon their identity to assume the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is clearly a measure of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels compelled to masquerade as a man for protection against potential threats. Her strategy is successful, but it also isolates her from other women, depriving her of crucial support. To complicate matters further, her disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and, consequently, falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, she must navigate her repressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nAlthough this might be seen as a progressive perspective, contemporary readers may view \"Twelfth Night\" as showcasing how deception can reveal hidden emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino's cases. Certain scenes suggest that these characters might possess unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because she believes Cesario is male, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It seems improbable, as Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia appears to mock those of his era who judge others based solely on appearances. This is evident in Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, eventually regarding Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "German colonial rule is often remembered for its harshness, particularly concerning the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. However, it is important to recognize that no colonial empire can be fully described with such a broad statement. The German colonial empire displayed a wide range of policies and governing styles, differing as much as its geographic spread. Educational offerings across the colonies were similarly varied. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a substantial number of well-educated and literate Africans. German educational initiatives in Kamerun and other territories were also lauded by writers of the period.\n\nIn contrast, the situation in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was notably different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established state schools and contributed significantly to the education of the local population, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. The government did, however, allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans within the colony, developing a system of state schools and providing greater support and regulation for missionary schools. These educational policies left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies saw a significant number of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" A variety of social, political, and economic factors contributed to the different experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the discussion by identifying these factors and highlighting recent research on the perceptions of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere exists an extensive body of literature focused specifically on education within the German colonial empire. Most of these texts are in German and were composed in the early 20th century, during or shortly after German colonial rule. The primary goal of these early works was to detail the characteristics of educational systems within these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse by offering comparative studies of education across various German colonies and providing more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. Notably, Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa directly addresses the topic of this paper. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounts for many of the distinctive features of its educational system.\n\nRelative to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa enjoyed a somewhat temperate climate, although much of the area is characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored the relatively favorable living conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once experienced a prolonged and challenging period of rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). This rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the United States launched an attack on Mexico, resulting in a victory that allowed it to annex Texas and the American Southwest. Several other conflicts occurred between these two nations, finally subsiding just before the outbreak of the First World War. The root of the rivalry lay in significant disagreements over religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a substantial clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is reminiscent of numerous other countries that have long-standing rivalries with their neighbors. Nations that share borders often encounter conflicting interests, which can give rise to adversarial positions. The case of the United States and Mexico mirrors many enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both Mexico and Cuba are geographically close to the United States and have maintained rivalrous relationships with it, in contrast to other Latin American countries that have generally enjoyed amicable relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences significantly contributed to the divide between the United States and Mexico, a challenge that has troubled many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) argues that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). Similar to the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which combined ideological struggle with competition over perceived vital interests, the conflict between the United States and Mexico was rooted in religious disparities rather than political structures. This mutual distrust stemmed from the historical animosity between the English and Spanish, which the United States and Mexico inherited from their colonial predecessors, complicating efforts to establish friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes involved territorial issues, such as border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent problem until both the United States and Mexico deployed military forces to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97). Schmitt (1974) notes that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and ultimately concluded as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the latter part of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years back, my life took an unexpected turn when I was suddenly disabled by a condition I had never heard of before.\n\nAt that time, I was working as a nurse. I had selected this career driven by a deep-seated need for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always have a job; people will always need medical care,\" was a constant refrain throughout my teen years and beyond. So, even though my aspirations leaned towards becoming a scientist or a journalist—or perhaps both—I opted for a career in nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, without any savings, and unable to work. I remain disabled to this day, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability benefits, I find myself with virtually nothing to claim as my own. I manage to get by, but each day is a battle that challenges my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life feels stable anymore, but there is one truth I hold onto: without the support of my family and a few close friends, I would not have survived these years, regardless of my personal strength. When true calamity hits, you certainly don't feel very strong.\n\nThe reality is that life will always throw unexpected challenges our way, both big and small. No level of preparation can guarantee security, as some obstacles are simply too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nI firmly believe that in the U.S., we need to move away from relying solely on the government, which is showing signs of decay and instability. Instead, I would prefer to see Americans fostering trust and cooperation—supporting one another and being willing to seek support—rather than each person independently preparing for doomsday scenarios.\n\nWhile the U.S. Conservatives praise \"rugged individualism\" as a cornerstone of our nation's history, the truth is that our ancestors persevered through tough times not because of individualism but through compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. Those who traveled in wagon trains across the Rockies didn't succeed by going it alone.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. I've assembled a disaster kit with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. I have multiple flashlights, a variety of batteries, an abundance of candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the land and resources to maintain a small farm and preserve your own food, go for it. It's a wise choice, as is investing in a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut as you prepare, take the time to get to know your neighbors.",
            "In the distant past, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would later become known as Buddha. Throughout his life, he chose to leave behind worldly life and achieved enlightenment. His teachings became the foundation of Buddhism, with the most traditional branch being Theravada Buddhism. This religion has a history spanning approximately 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. This evolution is evident in various places, such as Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada Buddhist country, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious meaning despite not being part of Buddha's original teachings. These variations range from ceremonial practices to the fundamental beliefs of the religion. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, as well as both supportive and challenging forces.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently utilized in this discussion. The idea of internal versus external forces is one of these. Internal forces are those that originate from members of the Buddhist community, regardless of their monastic status. External forces refer to influences from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is one that harms or seeks to harm the Buddhist community, stemming from a negative view of Buddhism. Conversely, a benign force does not aim to either harm or assist the Buddhist community, although it might inadvertently do so. These terms will be referenced multiple times throughout the discussion.\n\nTo begin, it is crucial to explore the fundamental aspects of the religion—the essential doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, or \"three baskets,\" of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka comprises all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules of discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the metaphysical elements of Buddhism. These metaphysical ideas include concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By understanding these concepts, one can end Sansara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth. With the cessation of Sansara comes the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living. Laypeople follow five precepts: refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks adhere to many more rules of discipline. The most essential doctrinal aspect in Buddhism is the four noble truths: first, the truth of Dukkha, acknowledging that life involves suffering; second, that attachment leads to suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."
