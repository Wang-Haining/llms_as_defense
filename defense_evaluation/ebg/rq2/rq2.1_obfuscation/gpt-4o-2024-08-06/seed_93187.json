            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation, culture holds a pivotal influence. It can often be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually represents. Culture is far from being uniform or a single entity. It isn't a simple, homogenous concept. Broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and inherently misleading. While having an understanding of a culture's general traits can be useful, it's far more effective for a negotiator to grasp the specific relevance of a culture to the negotiation and how its perspectives might influence discussions. When engaging with a different culture, individuals often relate it to their own, prompting inevitable comparisons.\n\nExploring a foreign culture or mindset might involve anything from delving into its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly during negotiations, especially when in a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, if a negotiator is in unfamiliar territory, showing respect for local traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural barriers and advancing the negotiation.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to a national or international divide. Companies often cultivate their own corporate cultures within a nation. For example, a company's culture might stress extended office hours or promote a more relaxed work schedule. Corporate culture manifests in various ways, such as employee dress codes, communication styles (be it direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropic efforts at any level, while others limit them to company-endorsed charities or events. Observing the diversity within American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within different regions of the same company) highlights the varied perspectives that can exist within a societal culture. Some cultures may appear less stratified than American culture and might seem more uniform to outsiders, yet this surface similarity invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial, as they reveal the reasons behind a culture. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony is highly valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly criticize their company or superior to gain an advantage. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle quickly. Considering these general tendencies is essential before entering negotiations. However, it's beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and marks the start of St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This sentiment is similarly embraced by Thomas Aquinas, another thinker under discussion. As both philosophers defend the notion of God's existence, our task is to evaluate which argument is superior. To maintain focus, we will assume they both correctly advocate for the existence of the biblical God. Introducing a different concept of divinity would hinder our ability to adequately compare their arguments, as they both address a specific understanding of God. Despite their compelling points, neither offers a comprehensive justification for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. He presents a path to understanding through faith, suggesting that introspection reveals evidence of God. Anselm argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Though his explanation can be complex and unclear, the essence is that the proof of God lies within one's mind. Anselm implies that we need not look beyond our own soul to discover the truth about God, as His existence is evident through what we inherently know to be true. External evidence seems unnecessary, with the concept of faith often invoked in Christian texts to describe accepting beliefs without empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through reason and empirical evidence, independent of faith. This approach is advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of new believers based solely on logical persuasion. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each illustrates that God's existence is a logical necessity. Just as one can infer the characteristics and presence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic alone can lead to the recognition of God.",
            "Authors often employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant themes. Among these techniques, some prove more impactful than others. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes an array of such methods. Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to certain elements and uses them to achieve a similar effect. Notably, Fitzgerald frequently employs this strategy with colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald establishes symbolic meanings for colors like white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke specific feelings or associations with key objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a sense of uniformity to the colors white and gray, with white representing a slightly more refined and upper-class connotation, while gray conveys a sense of age and fading. He introduces these meanings early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8)—indeed, many characters are described in white attire: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only notable departure from white clothing occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further associates these colors with mundane or insignificant subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby's party guests become \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" symbolizing uniformity (28). Additionally, he portrays ordinary individuals or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sufficiently established the meanings of white and gray, he employs them to suggest the insignificance or uniformity of certain subjects. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period without significant references to these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of a distinct character and more of a conventional addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression by surrounding Daisy with these colors, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her wearing a \"white\" dress (115) before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

These types of businesses allow landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus enabling recreational use and generating revenue through farm tours and educational activities.  \nOrganic farming not only fills a potentially profitable niche market but also increases biodiversity in plants and wildlife by avoiding chemical use in the soil and water. Nonetheless, organic farming can be pricier than conventional methods since it demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and to enrich the soil without chemicals. Additionally, organic farms often experience higher losses compared to traditional farms and lack the efficiency of larger operations. Practices that benefit wildlife, though not directly related to organic farming, can also add to labor costs, such as planting cover crops, managing grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create habitats with specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, landowners might need financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.  \nThe land selected for this scenario is a parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. Spanning 160 acres, it comprises chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is under review and considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \nNative Americans inhabited this area for countless centuries before it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood production throughout many intervening decades.  \nI chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore realistic options for a small farmer to mitigate costs and maintain wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of potential achievements for someone farming this land, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful, enduring one, filled with a spectrum of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique relationship allows brothers to understand each other deeply, seeing reflections of themselves in one another. In critical moments, the essence of this bond is revealed, whether it leads to positive or negative outcomes. The emotions tied to this relationship often come with significant consequences. Understanding these feelings requires acknowledging the impact they have. When someone looks into their brother's eyes and sees their true self, they perceive themselves in a more genuine light, beyond how others view them. It is through their actions and the resulting consequences that their true character is revealed. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers amid a vividly depicted setting. Their expedition, fraught with conflicting emotions like bitter disappointment and intense pride, ends tragically for one brother. The theme is highlighted through the characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview, heavily influencing his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be traced back to a central emotion: pride. From the outset of their adventures to their final, tragic outing, he harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had envisioned a sibling to share his skills with, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He desired a companion for racing to Horsehead Landing and sitting atop the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, Doodle's frail heart made such activities impossible, shattering the protagonist's dreams. His frustration even led him to consider harming Doodle, pondering smothering him with a pillow. Yet, a smile from Doodle softens his heart, rekindling hope. This moment illustrates that his intent was probably never strong, hinting at an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. Over time, as technology evolved from basic to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, a book, and more recently, a computer, these comparisons have developed over the years. However, when studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe process of handling information begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms then transform this sensory data through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details such as color, orientation, and object edges—where color changes abruptly—to recognize the box. Top-down processing uses this information to quickly identify the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped void in the white area.\n\nAfter some degree of processing, an attention filter evaluates the significance of the signal and decides which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might still notice your name being mentioned, even in a bustling room. There are multiple levels of processing, and attention repeatedly influences the outcomes.\n\nTo process information, the brain must store it first. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information undergoes encoding, which varies for different sensory stimuli. For example, verbal inputs can be encoded by appearance (structurally), sound (phonemically), or meaning (semantically). Once stored, information needs maintenance. Some animal research suggests that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through specific neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained within the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, with some based on human memory retrieval, others inspired by computer science, and yet others rooted in neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, within a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could connect to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial downturn. Joblessness climbed, the housing sector collapsed, and numerous major American corporations faced devastation. This recession lingers today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? Essentially, the crisis was a result of reckless and shortsighted political choices that led banks and companies to issue subprime loans within a fragile financial system. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to back and bundle these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the turmoil spread to the restructured mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as President Clinton sought to extend his tenure by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, his administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of The New York Times noted, \"Fannie Mae, the country's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may encounter difficulties in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier and as Holmes anticipated, poor lending practices were bound to trigger an economic collapse.\n\nVarious elements combined to send the economy into a downward spiral, one being the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets overextending themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered greatly. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—the part of your narrative that can either be a soaring showcase of your writing talents or the segment that causes readers to drift off or abandon your work altogether. Dr. Merlin, for instance, often finds herself exasperated when encountering excessive details, particularly when they aren't engaging.\n\nExposition can be a tricky element.\n\nMost seasoned readers are familiar with the advice to \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin occasionally ends up with lengthy sections where little happens, or too much does. Exposition is that mischievous voice that suggests explaining the background to get to the exciting parts (distinct from the other voice that insists on detailing every aspect of each character's past).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, generally through straightforward prose. In movies, it occurs when one character relays a significant amount of information to another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author who conveys this information.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine reading a story where you're informed that the heroine met her partner at a specific place and time, they married in a grand ceremony, and then her husband was tragically killed in front of her. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to be condensed into two pages, with minimal dialogue. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showcasing his love through his actions and words, and similarly, you'd want to see how the heroine's life was enriched by his presence. A detailed portrayal of the husband's character would allow you to feel invested in his fate and offer insights into the heroine's personality: what she cherished in him, the strength of their connection, and glimpses into her thoughts and dreams mirrored through his perspective. This emotional depth would make you grieve his loss alongside her, deepening your connection to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you'd anticipate a richer narrative beyond the bare storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's crucial to add depth to your story. (*considers metaphor, continues undeterred*) It's sometimes tempting to gloss over certain elements. Maybe you're introducing a new character, and you know he once served in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, was married twice, has no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly hopes to own the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, broadcast live, was NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story involved a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife, although her name wasn't mentioned. They showed his mug shot, which portrayed him as quite menacing. The coverage of this developing story lasted about two minutes, which seemed appropriate. The details shared were limited to the fact that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody.\n\nThe second segment covered a shooting incident involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. He was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area, with no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was looking into the matter. The brevity of this report stood out, possibly because it involved a black individual in a predominantly black neighborhood. It has been my observation over the years that crimes involving minority victims do not receive the same level of attention as those involving white individuals. For instance, when a white child or adult is kidnapped or harmed, the media coverage is extensive, whereas minority cases often receive minimal mention.\n\nAnother story discussed a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The report included details about the location of the incident, identifying the bullet as a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a reward of five thousand dollars for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe forecast segment outlined rain and thunderstorms expected on Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures predicted to be in the mid to low eighties. Although brief, this segment seemed intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nCoverage also included a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect, described as a dark-skinned black man, was wearing a hoodie. He was approximately six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The emphasis on his skin color and its darkness seemed unusually pronounced.\n\nAnother report featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating he received a 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months,\" possibly to make it sound harsher. They also highlighted that he was Hispanic, a detail that appeared irrelevant to the core of the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment vehicle that aims to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or collection of assets, much like an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs offer greater flexibility because they can be bought and sold like individual stocks on an exchange. One of the advantages of ETFs is that they combine the broad market exposure of index funds with the flexibility of stock trading, allowing investors to engage in practices such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing in small quantities, even as little as a single share. While these features are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs incurs commission fees similar to those associated with stock trades. Additionally, ETFs provide a vast array of fund choices. Despite these advantages, a prudent investor should critically assess whether the proclaimed benefits, like diversification, are truly present and to what degree. For this discussion, we will analyze the ETF IHF by comparing it with its top 10 underlying holdings, aiming to evaluate if owning a single ETF can match the benefits of holding a diversified set of the ten individual stocks. We will also explore if there are alternative configurations of these stocks that could yield a more favorable Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo streamline the analysis, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF’s total assets. These holdings and their respective asset percentages are outlined below.\n\nBy examining the proportion of assets attributed to these ten stocks and adjusting them to a normalized 100%, we can estimate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these stocks in the same proportions as those in the ETF. The chart below details the calculated Beta and return.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio restricted to the top 10 holdings achieves a return that is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, translating to a 16% improvement in returns. Furthermore, the Beta of these top ten holdings is lower by 0.12 compared to the ETF overall. The findings suggest that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a reduced Beta. Nonetheless, it's possible that the average returns of these two portfolios do not differ significantly in statistical terms. To determine the statistical significance of any differences, we calculate and normalize the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks to 100%, allowing us to compare their collective standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Examining Figure 17, it becomes evident that there was a significant decline in the submissions of commuter logs during the project's third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and pinpointing the exact cause is challenging. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely contributes to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, which could partially explain the drop-off. December also signifies the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when individuals are engrossed in completing assignments, grading, and other academic tasks. Consequently, logging commutes might not have been a priority for many. Moreover, December ushers in the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, possibly another reason for the low log entries that month. Nevertheless, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It's plausible that projects like this start with enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counteract this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign aimed at revitalizing the project, which resulted in an increase in log submissions. Thus, a key challenge was sustaining project momentum amid a natural dip in engagement and the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education.\n\nAnother obstacle for this or any alternative commuting project is the widespread preference for the autonomy and convenience of driving personal vehicles, a deeply ingrained cultural norm. Therefore, providing incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We awarded numerous prizes, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a local independent bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been intriguing to observe how offering more substantial prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, might have influenced participation, potentially addressing the drop in engagement. The prize structure remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing the value of the prizes over time might have encouraged continued participation. While the initial gift cards were adequate, announcing additional prizes like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have spurred greater engagement.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, numbering fifteen from the years 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily involved detailing the stylistic elements prevalent in most trick films and investigating the unique characteristics of some of the later works. Typically, trick films from this era are staged, filmed within a static, frontal proscenium setup, avoid camera movement, utilize long and medium shots, and adhere to a strict one shot equals one film principle. However, some films from the start of the twentieth century challenge these norms by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nA key feature shared by trick films is their filming on an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movement of figures or objects. This composition style was prevalent in early filmmaking, rooted in theatrical traditions and, specifically for trick films, in vaudeville and magic performances. The stage setting inherently restricts movement, with figures in trick films typically only moving laterally without advancing towards or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors appear from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow.\n\nThe frontal proscenium format also dictates the use of long shots and occasionally medium shots, with close-ups absent from Edison’s trick films. This mirrors the theatrical and vaudeville custom, where audiences observed the entire act at once, confined within the stage’s borders. As with many early films, actors remain in the middle distance, avoiding movement towards the camera, thus eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films generally conform to the principle that one conceptual shot represents an entire film. This confines their duration to roughly a minute or less, contingent on the frames per second. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic scope, with many focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, vanishing acts, and transformations with minimal storyline. It’s important to note, however, that in a trick film, what appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience may actually consist of several shots seamlessly combined to create illusions of appearing or disappearing. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), closer examination reveals the point where the scene with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt, in his work The Rise of the Gothic Novel, refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" This literary form has been regarded in various ways—some dismiss it, others extol its virtues, and opinions differ on its depth and the 'terrible sublime' quality it purportedly possesses, as observed by Burke. The inception of this genre can be traced back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which blended elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge a new path in literary expression. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical techniques with 'new' naturalistic elements of contemporary novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre harks back to medieval theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term applied to a variety of peoples, styles, and eras, often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated against the backdrop of \"modern\" societal and literary progress. The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which offers readers a more intimate understanding of characters' psychology, is what has allowed the Gothic genre to persist over time, simultaneously appearing outdated and fresh to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nA significant theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. This medieval concept, which encompasses the training of a knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors due to what it symbolizes—the archetypal knight, courageous, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of these qualities in their contemporary society, especially noted by Walpole. By incorporating chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future development of Gothic into Romantic literature, and serves as a means to critique and potentially elevate the present. When Walpole crafted The Castle of Otranto, he was navigating a politically turbulent era, filled with uncertainty about the future. Engulfed in political machinations and arguably unjust accusations, he might have begun to perceive, even if subconsciously, that the moral integrity and innate \"goodness\" associated with the gothic era were absent in the individuals of his own time. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic. Before even encountering Frederic, the reader learns that he embodies numerous chivalric qualities; he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic is portrayed using an abundance of traditional chivalric imagery; most notably, he is a prince who has endured suffering and tragedy, having left and believed to be slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, an exaggeration, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a series of processes that facilitate the movement of goods from the initial customer order through stages such as raw materials acquisition, supply, production, and ultimately distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant, who articulated it as the comprehensive process of organizing, executing, and overseeing operations within the supply chain to effectively fulfill customer demands. This management framework consists of six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which are leveraged by business managers to optimize customer service delivery.\n\nThe production phase marks the beginning of the supply chain journey. It serves as the cornerstone for the entire supply chain operation. During this phase, decisions are made regarding the timing, rationale, location, and method of production. Managers must ascertain customer preferences, which can be achieved by analyzing market trends, as the market serves as a significant indicator of consumer demands. Once managers have evaluated the market and grasped customer needs, they can determine which products to manufacture and the quantities required. Subsequently, decisions are made about the production site, choosing the most suitable plant to achieve the desired volume and quality of goods, ensuring customer satisfaction is prioritized. Once the production site is selected, managers then focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. The production stage is crucial in the supply chain process, where meticulous planning is essential to avoid potential time and financial losses. For instance, during my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, both organizations had detailed layouts and procedures for every facet of the business, from employee attire to receiving shipments. Such structured processes ensure smooth operations and clarity in roles and expectations.\n\nSupply is the second fundamental component of supply chain management. It involves making strategic decisions to define the core capabilities of a facility and forming outsourcing partnerships based on these decisions. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each equipped with different machinery, staff, and expertise. It is the manager's responsibility to determine which division is best suited for various product processes. Additionally, management may opt to outsource tasks to other companies, primarily to enhance velocity. Velocity refers to the ability to deliver quality and adaptability while simultaneously minimizing costs or maintaining low expenditure levels.",
            "Victorian novels are often noted for their meticulous detailing and focus on the upper echelons of society during that era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, depart from this norm. Both incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of their time, to deepen the portrayals of their characters and offer insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\nA striking example from Oliver Twist illustrates this: “And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels frequently use mysterious elements like dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specifics differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, such occurrences often unveil aspects of Oliver's psyche, his suffering, and his understanding of the reality surrounding him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it intensely, as if dreaming, while desperately seeking help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, highlighting his precarious health condition through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The overwhelming nature of the shooting numbs his senses, leaving him unaware of the “unseen hand” that rescues him; he endures his misery again, with pain now tied to fear rather than surprise. This raises questions about whose actions led to his plight, as it certainly wasn't his own doing. The shooting underscores Oliver's powerlessness, showing his inability to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. The text hints at a growing sense of submission in Oliver, as if Fagin’s influence is wearing him down, making him accept his despair and affecting his capacity to respond. Otherwise, it would seem that Oliver would attempt to act, if only to preserve his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. My role was to assist them in the subjects they found challenging, though I was particularly skilled in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in third or fourth grade and having significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, while others were a complete struggle. Despite being of Latino descent, Adrian spoke English perfectly. Our challenges continued until I met his mother while supervising a small group of students left behind during a field trip. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it suddenly became clear: Adrian's issue wasn't with reading itself, but rather with his grasp of the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this insight helped him, but I sincerely hope he's improved.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue prevalent in schools, especially in California. It illustrates how this barrier isn't always apparent. Even a child fluent in spoken English can face significant hurdles in reading. Recognizing the problem is straightforward, but finding solutions is another matter. For Adrian, focused tutoring on English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, was the answer. However, for many children who speak little English, the solution is more complex. No single approach, be it dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes, can solve this issue alone. The key is to integrate all these methods.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is a promising strategy. It's beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers. Despite concerns that such programs are resource-intensive and offer little benefit to the majority, this is a misconception. Implementing these programs universally would benefit all students. The challenge is in execution. Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's impractical. However, there is no reason why we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, or seek answers within their own hearts. Many people embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their families. Yet, some choose to reject these beliefs, insisting there's nothing beyond their personal, self-centered reality. We might adopt a particular set of values, only to later shift to another. Regardless of the path we take, we embark on a journey to define a part of ourselves through our individual views on spirituality. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness into brightness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my dad replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain pounding on the metal roof above as we shared a smoke. The downspouts directed the rain, overwhelming the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, a look that seemed both searching and reminiscent. Over the past few months, he had become thinner, with his clothes hanging loosely on him. His hair had thinned as well, more so than I remembered. He continued to avoid eye contact, staring into the rain. I felt isolated, scared, unable to express to my dad how much I would miss him, fearing that discussing it would make it all too real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in looking out at the rain falling in the June evening.\n\nLater that year, in December, my father passed away, just five days after I turned twenty-two. The treatments hadn't eased his pain but had extended his life slightly beyond what doctors had predicted. I couldn't find any value in prolonging his suffering. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I didn't pray. If God existed, it seemed to me that he had stopped listening long ago.\n\nI didn't want to see him transition from this life to whatever lay beyond, so I chose not to be there. I couldn't witness the end of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I understood him better than anyone else, even better than his family, and knew he wouldn't want his only child witnessing his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even reached out to me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate of Republicanism in its early days. Although primarily an agriculturist, his time in politics and dedication to personal liberty and governance made him a notable figure. Taylor's commitment to an agrarian lifestyle was central to his views on government. His efforts to safeguard and promote what he saw as the noblest profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to establish an exemplary system, free from the constraints of native traditions that could impede the creation of self-governance. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one compromises the rest, diminishing their value. Thus, he argued that these rights should remain untouched by governmental authority. He contended that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" allowed those with strength and cunning to prosper, a situation that civilization should not replicate.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He held firm views on dual morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He identified good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and curb capitalism, believing that a government rooted in these principles would operate justly, even if led by self-interest and greed. He saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions, only deemed negative when it fostered societal divisions that benefited some at the expense of others. A well-structured government was essential to restrain man's inherent evil, requiring vigilant oversight to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike other committed Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly restricted Federal government, granted only the powers explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He understood that a large Federal government could be costly and potentially tyrannical. Nonetheless, he recognized the risks of a straightforward, literal approach and warned that ignoring the framers' intent could lead to corruption. He also regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly defines the nation as a collective of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "I looked down, my mind taking in the scene before me with a detached calmness. Quietly and without emotion, my practiced awareness observed without trying to connect the scene to any larger concept, my mind processing the image I beheld. Thoughts entered and exited my mind almost quicker than they arrived. My consciousness operated so smoothly that it felt as though I had no independent thoughts, just a fluid and active experience of the sight before me. \n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I knew, I bought a book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had been eager to learn drawing since I was six, and the book covers everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One method it suggested was using a square frame to focus on any picture the artist wanted to examine. This approach turned a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a simpler image of a bowl of fruit on a flat surface. \n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awed, and could only stand there in wonder. Picasso had his blue period, Monet had a passion for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters reveled in color. If I aspired to call my perspective Artistic, then here lay the beginnings of my work, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen artistic tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved, my mind's intention taking shape in what might have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled calmly and smoothly, clear and pristine. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. My muscles tensed, my hand more quickly and anxiously hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown object remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet planted firmly, green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned at the offensive bundle of processed materials someone had left for those of us cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and a few more moments of introspection, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly submerged into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "The issue of teenage fatalities in car accidents is a growing concern. Various elements contribute to the alarming statistics associated with young drivers in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of this problem is that teenagers' brains are not fully developed to manage the dangers of driving. Additionally, lack of experience significantly contributes to the issue, leading not just to more fatal accidents but also a higher incidence of rollovers, speeding, and other road mishaps. \n\nMoreover, teenagers are at greater risk when driving with friends, a common scenario. Research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlights a connection between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, states like California have introduced provisional licenses for teens, which impose restrictions on driving hours and carrying minor passengers. However, I believe these measures are merely temporary solutions. The root problem is that young drivers, based on statistical evidence, are generally unprepared to manage the responsibilities and risks of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 might be too young for a full driver's license. His research, discussed by USA Today, indicates that individuals under 19-20 often seek risky thrills. Delaying the age for obtaining a driver's license could reduce these risks as the propensity for thrill-seeking diminishes.\n\nWithout changes, we risk seeing an increase in fatal accidents as more young drivers take to the roads, especially as the children of the Baby Boomer generation become eligible for licenses by 2010. Implementing legislation to address this is relatively straightforward. Schools could still offer driver’s education to start training future drivers, but operating a vehicle could be restricted to those 18 and older. Provisional permits could be granted before full licenses, with a specified number of training hours required. This requirement could align with existing state standards, such as California’s current 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.\n\nConsidering the widespread nature of this issue, uniform national legislation would be a sensible and effective strategy to protect teenagers nationwide. The concept of such legislation is not new, but it is a necessary step.",
            "This document explores three primary aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. Then, it delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting typical traits or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it discusses strategies that teachers in mainstream classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is described as the proficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) interprets auditory information. More specifically, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain cannot properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD typically have normal hearing and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" However, the brain region responsible for distinguishing words or differentiating between speech and background noise does not operate in the usual manner.\n\nThe earliest reference to what would become known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, when it was termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) during studies of children with communicative disorders. In 1954, an Italian research team led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children. Subsequently, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various forms: individuals may struggle to localize or perceive sound in space, have difficulty distinguishing between different \"acoustic events,\" fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm conveyed through vocal tone. Additionally, one sound may mask another, subsequent sound, and individuals might lack the capability to synthesize auditory cues into meaningful interpretations that guide their actions. They may also be challenged in recalling the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a thorough screening, involving \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function.\" This process might be handled by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and other professionals using a variety of measures that assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These evaluations could include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, particularly how individuals respond to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test with a high rate of diagnostic accuracy, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many diagnostic procedures involve presenting patients with multiple, concurrent auditory stimuli, asking them to identify specific items such as a sequence of words or numbers. More advanced diagnostics may involve measuring acoustic signals within the ear and recording the responses to these signals.",
            "I am eager to pursue a career in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, with the aim of assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in crisis. I bring to the field of social work a dedication to service, a deep respect for others, a commitment to ethical practice, and a resolve to foster better relationships while continually enhancing my professional skills. These values are not only essential to the profession of social work but are also deeply significant to me on a personal level.\n\nSince childhood, I've been drawn to helping others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path would best fulfill this aspiration. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems and some adopting less-than-ideal coping strategies. Witnessing these situations influenced my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still unsure of my career direction, I took some time to reflect. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was visibly anxious. She explained that he was trying to escape an abusive home. The next day, he reported his parents to the authorities. Feeling compelled to help, I visited his parents' home and expressed my concerns to the police, mentioning my recent degree in Psychology. The police asked me to speak with the parents as legal intervention was not an option for the teen. In conversation, the parents appeared uneasy and attempted to justify their son’s actions. This experience profoundly impacted me and led me to seriously consider a career in social work, focusing on resolving family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Our society often claims to value individuals, yet paradoxically, pressures them to conform. This contradiction has always puzzled me, as I value my individuality and resist societal pressures to conform. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively opposed social injustice by expressing myself through unique hair colors and clothing, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights through the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, and standing against racism and discrimination. I am committed to promoting social justice and will continue to challenge social injustices wherever I encounter them.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks in the context of insomnia. The biological framework examines inherited genetic factors and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural framework considers environmental interactions and their implications for race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review analyzes insomnia by discussing these frameworks and detailing selected research to elucidate and enhance the understanding of each model. The research explanations and findings are subsequently evaluated to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, disorders related to another mental condition, or those associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas disorders linked to another mental condition relate to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia concerns staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy features cataplexy and/or automatic REM. While Dyssomnias are primarily about sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are related to behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic, heritable, and physiological factors. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that encourage sleep, while inhibition of its firing can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was found to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. An issue or absence of this receptor could impact one's ability to sleep without medication. The sociocultural dimension of this study implies that if the phenotype were inherited, it could manage sleep, and any alteration of the receptor would naturally disrupt sleep, affecting aspects of life such as education, work, and daily activities requiring focus and routine.",
            "I've been attending University Park for around two and a half years now, which amounts to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm in East Halls, located at the far eastern edge of the campus, apart from the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take as long as 25 minutes on foot, particularly in bad weather, which is common in State College. A conversation with a recent alum revealed that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated by large expanses of unused land. Today, those areas have been developed into sports fields, significant new structures such as the new Creamery and health services building, and are now encircled by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What could be the most effective solution for mobility issues on a college campus? The answer lies in bicycles. However, simply having bikes won't resolve the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists' needs.  \nA friend of mine, who recently started biking again after several years, brought up an interesting point. He said, \"Bikes are fantastic. For a while, it wasn't considered cool to ride one, but it's really the best way to get around.\" Besides promoting physical fitness, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I currently live off-campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was purchasing a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a good twenty-five-minute walk from where I live. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. The challenge lies in Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my home, which can be difficult to navigate, with or without a bike. While walking has its advantages, my schedule is too packed for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my day for a walk to Thomas. That equates to over two and a half hours each week. On top of that, there’s all the additional walking time to other classes and appointments. It's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In the novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist framework that supports it by depicting a dystopian society. In this world, the collective is prioritized over the individual, and from birth, people are conditioned to seek immediate gratification above everything else. The citizens are portrayed as mere instruments in a larger scheme, adhering to a single ideology as directed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism regarding the evolution of these systems. Terms commonly used in Marxism, such as hegemony and reification, bolster the notion that Huxley's work critiques the flaws of the economic landscape of his era.\n\nCapitalism is caricatured through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary citizens are kept from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control of the working class, made evident by the conditioning in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy; hypnopaedia intensifies their urge to consume, spend, and indulge. This manipulation is orchestrated, as mentioned, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the complete dominance of social groups by another, is clearly applied here. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology supporting this structure, namely capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes can recognize it but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, aside from characters like Bernard, challenge their status. The interactions among social classes, as will be further examined, highlight capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between different individuals do not exist. The novel seemingly avoids distinguishing characters—even major ones lack depth. Huxley might be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent; interactions are superficial, depicted through the way men talk about women, focusing mainly on their physical attributes, and women openly discuss their experiences. Moreover, each class's contentment with their hierarchical placement reveals capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their strict adherence to their communal roles reflects Marxist views on the proletariat, who are mistakenly convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A central topic of intense debate in the class was the perception of Islam as either a peaceful or hostile religion. I find this question even more pertinent today than before. Reflecting on the period since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam—from an initially antagonistic stance towards Islamic extremism to a more tolerant approach within America. In 2001, it seemed unlikely to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has connections to Islam.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it contradicts his portrayed character. Previously, I believed Muhammad compelled people to embrace Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion upon them. However, the biography presents Muhammad as a misunderstood figure, almost martyr-like, who humbly engaged with others. It describes how individuals gradually recognized the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking resemblances between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad. A notable example is when he allegedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style suggests that the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a modest prophet who embodied truth and performed miracles without needing to prove himself. I find this problematic as it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly borrowing from Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, numerous stories in the biography seem designed to demonstrate instances of voluntary conversion to Islam. Yet, many of these accounts appear to be third-hand, with the author recounting hearsay from various sources. This approach, intended to validate the stories, actually makes them seem less credible and more dubious to me.\n\nWhat concerns me most about this biography is its attempt to portray Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical accounts often challenge the notion of Muhammad as gentle and humble, leading me to question whether Muslims today are aware of the full history behind Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his lifetime. If we examine this history on a broad scale, we notice a tendency for Christianity to drift further from its roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and an unprecedented push towards progressiveness. While there are still traditionalists who resist new ways of thinking beyond what they've been taught, this group may not have enough influence to sway the majority. Within the Christian community, there will be a significant increase in historical awareness in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to separate the doctrines added over time from the original intent of Christianity's namesake. Although this may take decades or even centuries, the result is inevitable: a significant shift back to the original form of Christianity. A movement will emerge to peel back layers of doctrine, as if time is being reversed, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced on behalf of God remains, untouched by subsequent claims. As this movement spreads across the United States and Europe, inspiring people to worship as if in Jesus' time, adhering strictly to his teachings, the church will remain strong to guide this transformation. However, as theological perspectives regress, the diversity within Christianity will diminish into greater uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and all divisions, there will be a trend towards similarity rather than difference. History is marked by significant reversals. One example is the early persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian stronghold. Our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversal will take place within Christianity, seeking to undo history and diversity in pursuit of its origins. An essential part of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? By looking far back into history, we find the beginnings of Christianity in Judaism, which laid the foundation with monotheism, the notion of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures, all established by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was not united, as it was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a broad spectrum of common people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest that lie within human nature. People tend to prioritize their own well-being and prosperity, often neglecting those who are less fortunate. This theme is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. Their primary focus is on expanding and enhancing their businesses, disregarding the impact on others or the harm their progress may cause. Upton Sinclair's depiction of the industrial landscape underscores this disregard: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the environmental destruction resulting from pollution and the lack of concern for both people and animals affected by it. The factory owners show no remorse for the smoke and waste produced by their operations.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers exhibit little concern for their employees, who toil to generate their wealth. They pursue profit at all costs, sacrificing loyalty and decency: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long hours and face abrupt layoffs without compensation or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" few, if any, laws existed to protect workers' safety or welfare, allowing management to exploit their labor under harsh conditions. Although not explicitly stated, those who toiled and perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the dire circumstances both in and out of the workplace. No organizations existed to support or inform workers, and while unions emerged, they often exacerbated the plight of the laborers by profiting from their struggles. The workers were so oppressed and trapped within the Packingtown system that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finer poetic creations. Within this poem, Poe makes use of the term \"Thulé,\" a reference found in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil employed this term to describe an island located to the north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil's use of the term is well-documented, it's important to note that there is a more contemporary influence on Poe's work. Poe showed a keen interest in German authors.\n\nThis particular reference underscores Poe's awareness of Goethe's literary contributions. In his book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt highlights the parallels between their two poems, suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was an esteemed writer, known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—first in 1808 and later in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem recounts the story of a king whose wife passes away, leaving him a goblet as a gift. Grief-stricken, the king becomes consumed by heavy drinking and sorrow. In his final moments, he bequeaths his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He then approaches a cliff, hurls the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and meets his own end. The demeanor of the King of Thulé closely resembles that of the figure in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's inclusion of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe refers to Thule on two occasions in his body of work. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but uses the term twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. Viewed collectively, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's landscape as dark and solitary, haunted by the specters of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with the themes in Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his desire to rule or live. The poem's atmosphere suggests that the narrator has entered Goethe's literary world.\n\nGoethe was a prominent figure in literature, and Poe would have been familiar with his work, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe once remarked on his respect for Tennyson. Beyond this connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's writings through the numerous reproductions that emerged following the initial publication.",
            "Under the legal framework of California, could a shopper who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket potentially receive punitive damages by arguing that the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill but not addressing it for thirty minutes because he was having his dinner? It seems unlikely that a judge would immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To argue for such an award, a plaintiff must present evidence showing that the defendant's actions were taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their conduct could cause, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could assert that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning up the spill, given that other customers had suffered injuries from slipping in the months leading up to Palmer's accident at D&D. Despite this awareness, Martin neglected to ensure the spill was cleaned up. Palmer's claim that Martin’s actions were despicable might be less convincing, yet it remains reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still didn't take proper steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 p.m., Rich Wayne, an employee at D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin, however, responded that he was on his dinner break and couldn't attend to customer complaints. At 5:15 p.m., another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, receiving the same response. At 5:30 p.m., the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. In the year 2009, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D. Now, Palmer is pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the consideration is on whether to submit a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute specifies malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have deemed conduct as malicious when done with a conscious disregard for a plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was a persistent feeling of yearning within her, an unfulfilled desire that had taken root around the age of 14, as she stepped into her teenage years. Even three years later, at 17, this feeling lingered. She had concluded that her longing was for a person, not an object. Yet, no boys had captured her interest. Some had shown attraction towards her, trying awkwardly to win over her seemingly unyielding heart, but none sparked her interest. She often pondered this puzzling situation, wondering what could lead a teenage girl to feel this way. Despite years of introspection, she had developed theories but nothing substantial enough to consider seriously. So, she continued her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nTypically, days spent at home were serene. Her parents were gentle and composed, rarely engaging in disagreements with each other, and seldom with her. The only disputes arose from her asserting her independence and spirited nature. Though born to a calm couple, she balanced their tranquility with her vibrant personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her quite likable.\n\nHowever, today was an exception to the usual calm. As she moved from one room to another, seeking fresh inspiration, a sudden scream from the kitchen interrupted the tranquility. It was her mother's familiar voice. Startled, she dashed into the kitchen, anxiety building as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, are you okay?!\" There, she found her mother on the floor, wincing and repeatedly uttering \"Ow\" with labored breaths. Rushing to her side, she placed a reassuring hand on her mother, who managed to say, \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words were forced and breathy, and her daughter could tell her mother was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where you need support.\" Her mother indicated, and at that moment, the daughter felt grateful for her strength training. She lifted her mother into the car, gently laid her in the backseat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital greeted them with the familiar blend of antiseptic and anxiety, yet she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She hurriedly brought her mother inside, calling for medical help. Concerned staff quickly gathered, placing her mother on a rolling bed and whisking her away for immediate attention, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a stepping stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf in their home.",
            "The objective of this research was to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with a decreased likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as mortality from stroke. The aMed diet is an altered form of the Med diet, emphasizing a greater intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (rather than saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have highlighted an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Moreover, an intervention trial established that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in aiding weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, past research did not specifically address stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes and were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Instances of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified as such. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin consumption, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and more accurately reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could interfere with results) by taking into account age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nStronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (including both fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile faced a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in the movie Juno, stands solitary at a street corner, gripping a cardboard sign with those unsettling words scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, which is also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw its first significant public demonstrations in a decade. These were spearheaded by numerous Burmese monks and came to be known as the “Saffron Revolution,” named after the saffron-colored robes the monks wore. Initially, the government reluctantly permitted the peaceful protests, but as the public's involvement grew, tensions intensified. The situation escalated into what many viewed as a conflict between the monks and the military, with the junta raiding monasteries across the nation. Foreign journalists were detained, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, merely for attending a protest. While official reports claim 13 fatalities, Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, suggested that the actual number of deaths was much higher, potentially in the thousands.\n\nThese acts of brutality are not unprecedented. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress opposition to maintain control. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their absolute authority. Similarly, Japanese emperors were seen as deities destined to guide their people. In the contemporary era, President George W. Bush reportedly held regular discussions with Ted Haggard, the leader of an organization named Stupid People Worldwide, affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nHistorical cases of such repression include the June 4, 1989, protests at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, workers, and students rallied against government authoritarianism. The death toll from this event varies, with Chinese government estimates at 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Another grim example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, during which Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, executed a systematic massacre targeting Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. The atrocities committed under Hitler’s ‘Third Reich,’ during which Jews were systematically exterminated across several countries, represent another extreme case of such oppression.",
            "Duke Ellington's remarkable impact on jazz is largely attributed to his enduring career and his innovative skill in orchestrating his band. While Ellington's piano presence is understated in many of the pieces chosen for this analysis, his prowess as a composer shines through his ability to craft intricate and layered compositions that highlighted his band members' talents. He constructed a musical environment where soloists could improvise freely while also composing tightly orchestrated segments that leveraged each musician's unique style to bring out musical concepts. Through this approach, he accentuated the orchestra's overall tone, creating unified and original melodies tailored to each piece. His exceptional understanding of individual musicians' sounds, combined with their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble, allowed him to produce some of jazz's most imaginative and outstanding works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when exploring Ellington's distinctive sound and inventiveness, points to Creole Love Call as an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early piece illustrates Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color independent of lyrics. Creole Love Call also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing his soloists' styles, a characteristic evident throughout his career. This deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds through six choruses, as follows:\n\nChorus 1: Features a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a coarser tone by the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo expands on the main melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo is supported by a discreet syncopated piano line.\nChorus 4: The entire band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece reaches its climax as the reeds initiate the call and response in a higher register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Revisits the first chorus's structure, with call and response between voice and reeds. Here, the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, performing as an instrument.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant, novel trombone ending.\n\nEllington's integration of voice to enhance the tonal diversity of the piece exemplifies a stylistic characteristic that permeates his body of work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington blends his tight orchestration skills with his sensitivity to tone color. The piece features a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, intertwining Miley’s vocal-like trumpet playing with Cox’s instrumental vocal style to create a complex and harmonious sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further explores these ideas, with Ellington using Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone to great effect.",
            "What causes organisms to evolve in the ways they do? Are there particular limitations or factors that guide evolutionary changes? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" a statement that holds true today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been increasingly applied to various aspects of mollusk shell formation throughout both individual development and evolutionary history (such as in the work of Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum species, combined with experimental studies, can help clarify the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. By using X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that could model both hypothetical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We then created models of hypothetical shell forms to explore the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of large-scale evolutionary events in this group.\n\nThink of a shell as a tube moving through 360 degrees of space over time. The turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, the columella, runs through the shell's central column. Whorls can expand at different speeds, and they are separated by a line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, also known as the body whorl. The spire includes all the whorls except for the last one. The spire’s tip is the apex, and the opposite end is called the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening termed the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" way to view a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nTo count whorls, one starts by looking at the shell from the apical view and identifying where the first suture begins. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and approximated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of openings that move through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates for the center of each whorl’s aperture along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented in both graphical and mathematical forms. Once a mathematical model is constructed, it's possible to adjust the parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell-forming process.",
            "In Indonesia, the rates of neonatal and infant mortality have not seen significant changes over the past decade. The country is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation. However, the necessary advancements in child and maternal health are not being achieved at the pace required to meet the targets set for 2015. The reasons for these deficiencies will be elaborated on, highlighting the importance of enhancing the overall health system instead of focusing solely on specific program interventions.\n\nThere have been advancements in ensuring skilled health workers are present at births, with 72% of deliveries now attended by such professionals. However, this figure also includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who are not equipped to handle medical complications during childbirth, contributing to the high number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Therefore, while progress in this area is reflected in the statistics, it presents a somewhat deceptive picture, indicating that substantial efforts are still needed. Moreover, there is a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving treatment from healthcare professionals. Although comprehensive data on postnatal care is lacking, it is evident that this remains a significant concern nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates are lower than expected, approximately 4%. This statistic also highlights another issue: the disparity in healthcare access between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, the cesarean section rate is 7%, compared to just 2% in rural regions, underscoring the uneven distribution of healthcare services. Additionally, there is a noticeable gap in healthcare service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest segments of the population, with a 27% difference, indicating that the poor face greater barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to the financial burden involved.\n\nWhen considering the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to effectively address the shortfall in service provision. Should Indonesia implement specific program strategies or focus on strengthening the health system as a whole without centering on maternal and child healthcare before and after pregnancy? Program-specific strategies are appealing as they offer targeted and manageable objectives, often yielding quicker results. However, there are potential drawbacks. A significant concern is that concentrating resources on one area can divert funding from other sectors, leading to an imbalance in resource allocation (as seen with the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning services). Moreover, running several parallel programs can lead to service duplication and a lack of coordination, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and fund management.",
            "Over the past century, the landscape of Popular Music has expanded to encompass countless genres, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even further subdivisions. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably evolved into one of the most varied and expressive categories of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a broad spectrum of emotions, albeit often leaning toward the more somber end. In terms of diversity, soon after its inception, the genre's inherent flexibility was recognized, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has reached a level of diversity where pinpointing a precise definition of what constitutes heavy metal is challenging. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet like all things, it originated from a specific point. To fully appreciate the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends being just a genre.\n\nIn various respects, metal is a movement characterized by its dark themes. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, volume, intensity, and theatricality. It moves away from primitiveness, showcasing skilled musicianship; members of metal bands are adept with their instruments, and this expertise is evident in their music. Unsurprisingly, metal is also a movement with significant drug influences. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental music, with artists using substances as a catalyst for creating groundbreaking and otherworldly records. Metal's dark and visceral qualities stood out in the music scene, contrasting with the predominantly lighter themes in popular music. Later metal generations drew inspiration from the dark and intense elements that were prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics reflecting this darkness are emblematic of the movement, such as those by Byrne.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles showcase their darker side, depicting a tumultuous experience often associated with drug use. This track is sometimes cited as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a Rolling Stones track that also explored heavier, darker themes. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the intensity of the Stones, leading to the inclusion of this song on The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist movement captured imaginations with its dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was already weaving his own visions, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only portrays a woman marveling at the wonders of an unfamiliar dreamscape but also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. From the beginning of his journey, Rousseau longed for recognition and acclaim from the art world he cherished, yet he grappled with an internal struggle to achieve this dream. The Dream encapsulates his enduring conflict: should he adhere to established artistic norms to gain acceptance, or should he forge his own path with a distinct and independent style?\n\nUnderstanding The Dream requires a glimpse into Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau hailed from a modest background; his father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who experienced some degree of prosperity (Shattuck 47). Without formal artistic training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, or toll service employee, until he was forty, though he was inaccurately referred to as a customs inspector, or douanier (Shattuck 46). The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, after the deaths of eight infant children, left him with one surviving daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a new beginning, he turned to painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized rural life, Rousseau remained true to his roots, embodying the hopes and dreams of an ordinary person of his social class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance in the art community is understandable given his circumstances: he lacked formal education in painting, started his career later in life, and was overshadowed by more prominent artists of his time. Despite years of effort, it wasn’t until the emergence of artists like Matisse that Rousseau began gaining recognition. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, their motivations and methods were distinct. While Matisse feared falling into cliché, Rousseau aspired to create works so traditional that he would be welcomed by the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "Numerous philosophers have explored the close relationship between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I am convinced there is a fundamental reason for this connection. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding is gained through education or experience, yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics more intuitively, without conventional instruction. Ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our discussions on morality and beauty primarily focus on explaining why a piece of art or a deed is admirable, rather than setting guidelines for assessing or producing good art or moral conduct.\n\nFurthermore, critiques of art or morality often fall short of truly encapsulating what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or its cultural significance, but ultimately, these elements do not fully account for its artistic merit. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before offering a more detailed analysis. I contend that the essence of art and morality cannot be entirely captured by describing their attributes. Flannery O'Connor once remarked, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we analyze a literary work, there remains an indescribable quality. I believe ethics shares this trait. Wittgenstein observed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this indescribable \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that is the most potent feature of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI propose that the profound connection between morality and art stems from how we experience both on a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. They affect us in ways that are felt deeply yet are hard to completely articulate. This link is particularly strong in the realm of literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a formidable nation, characterized by a rich tapestry of culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic coast in Kiel. This cultural essence is similarly present from Cologne along the Rhine, through Germany’s heartland, reaching the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It is only natural that contemporary Germany's identity is rooted in a variety of different origins and tribes.\n\nThe land known as Germania is the ancestral home of the German people. The etymology of its name is a subject of debate among scholars and historians. According to Tacitus, the term originated from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to confront the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the term “Germanus” in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he recounted subduing the Gauls and engaging with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under questionable pretenses. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. Although the origin remains uncertain, some suggest it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar remarks: “The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, with whom the Gauls are in perpetual conflict... They engage with the Germans in almost daily skirmishes.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Some propose that the name derives from the spear, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” indicating the Germans' loud demeanor (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” the early Roman historian Tacitus described the origins of the Germans, stating, “I would consider [the Germans] as native and unmixed with other races through either migration or intermarriage. In earlier times, it was by sea, not by land, that immigrants arrived... Who would leave Asia or Africa, or even Italy, for Germany, with its harsh landscapes, severe climate, and grim customs, unless it was truly their home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They ventured into Germanic lands for resources and conducted occasional military campaigns, but ultimately, they returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they settled along the Roman Empire’s borders, trading their land-derived goods and offering their expertise by serving in the Roman military (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the use of disguise can be quite effective for maintaining deception over time. However, ultimately, one must abandon this false identity to avoid losing their true self. The challenge in ending a deception is the potential alienation it may cause. Thus, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may react neutrally to the realization of being deceived, others may not be as forgiving and could take offense at the deception.\n\nThe theme of deception, particularly in the context of reversing gender roles, introduces additional complexities. A critical question arises: why does someone feel compelled to abandon their identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? Viola’s situation provides an example of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels the need to disguise herself as a man for protection against potential threats. Although her strategy succeeds, it isolates her from the women around her, severing a crucial support network. Compounding the situation, her male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her, saying, “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nWhile this might appear progressive to contemporary readers, Twelfth Night can be viewed as a narrative where deception unveils hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest that the presence of Viola/Cesario compels these characters to confront unspoken desires. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario purely because of his male appearance, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It can be argued that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare’s portrayal of Olivia seems to satirize individuals of his era who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her romantic interest from Cesario to Sebastian and starts considering Cesario/Viola as family instead of a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial regime has been characterized by various commentators for its harshness, particularly with regard to the atrocity against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with such a broad brush is an oversimplification. The German colonial empire encompassed a range of policies and governance styles, much like its geographic diversity. Educational opportunities within the colonies mirrored this variability. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education were recognized in Kamerun and other colonies by contemporary scholars. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) stood in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the local population, South West Africa largely delegated native education to missionary groups, which received minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up a system of state schools alongside more substantial support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting implications for South West Africa, persisting beyond German rule. While other German colonies featured notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the different experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the dialogue by identifying these factors and focusing on recent research about the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans. There exists an extensive body of literature specifically about education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary objective of early works was to outline the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language writings expanded the discussion through comparative studies of education in various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work that directly addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational frameworks of the two colonies and examines the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of the colony's educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, even though much of the region is arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored its relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that experienced a lengthy rivalry, which lasted 57 years from 1836 to 1893, as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). This tense relationship reached its peak during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, when the United States launched an offensive against Mexico, emerging victorious and acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other confrontations occurred between the two countries, eventually subsiding just before the outbreak of World War I. The origins of this rivalry can be traced back to disagreements over crucial issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as significant material interests, as highlighted by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario is not dissimilar to many other nations worldwide that have ongoing rivalries with neighboring countries. Border-sharing nations frequently encounter conflicting interests, leading to the establishment of adversarial positions. The United States and Mexico exemplify such enduring rivalries between bordering countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations are geographically proximate to the United States and have historically been its rivals, whereas other Latin American countries have typically maintained amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of friction between the two nations, a common historical issue among many countries. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that \"while in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were against Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Much like the Cold War's ideological and interest-based rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, this earlier conflict was rooted not in political systems but in the religious preferences of the two countries. This mutual suspicion stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, a sentiment inherited from their colonial pasts, which posed a considerable challenge in fostering friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry period between Mexico and the United States. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws targeting American border towns were a persistent problem until both countries strengthened their military presence at the borders, as Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry between the nations began to diminish when \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually concluded as American interests transitioned \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) towards the end of the 19th century.",
            "About fifteen years back, an unexpected illness left me suddenly disabled, something I had never imagined. At the time, I was working as a nurse. My career choice was driven by a deep-seated desire for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. Growing up, I often heard the saying, \"People will always need healthcare, so you'll always have a job.\" Although my true aspirations leaned toward becoming a scientist or a journalist, or perhaps both, I decided to pursue nursing.\n\nFast forward to being 46 years old, I found myself single, with no significant savings, and unable to continue working. Today, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing to call my own. I manage to get by, but each day brings challenges that threaten my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite the uncertainty that now characterizes my life, one truth remains: I couldn't have endured these years without the support of my family and a few close friends, no matter how resilient I believed myself to be. In the face of true calamity, feeling strong is rare.\n\nEmergencies, both large and small, are inevitable in life. No matter how prepared we are, some situations are simply too overwhelming to tackle alone. I agree that in the U.S., we need to diversify our reliance beyond big government, which is undeniably crumbling. However, I would prefer to see Americans rebuild trust in each other, fostering a culture of mutual aid rather than isolation.\n\nWhile some US Conservatives praise \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our nation, it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing that sustained our ancestors through tough times. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains reached the coast not by going it alone, but through collective effort.\n\nTherefore, it's wise to be prepared. I am. I have assembled a disaster kit, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. My preparations also include flashlights, various batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the means to cultivate a small farm or preserve your own food, it's advisable. A wood stove is also beneficial, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you make these preparations, remember to connect with your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would eventually become known as the Buddha. Throughout his lifetime, he chose to leave worldly life behind and attained enlightenment, resulting in the creation of Buddhism. The oldest and most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism. This religious tradition has been around for about 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since the time of the Buddha. Such changes are evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where people observe the annual water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious meaning even though the Buddha did not teach any such celebration. These variations are not only visible in surface-level practices but also penetrate the core teachings of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its doctrinal beliefs over time due to various influences, both internal and external, whether they be adversarial or neutral.\n\nIn this discussion, several key terms will be frequently used. The first is the distinction between internal and external forces. Internal forces arise from within the Buddhist community, known as the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status, while external forces come from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm Buddhism, often stemming from negative perceptions of it. Benign forces, on the other hand, neither seek to harm nor aid Buddhism, although they may inadvertently do so. These terms will be discussed repeatedly throughout this exploration.\n\nTo begin, it is essential to examine the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. These philosophical concepts include Anatta, the absence of a permanent self; Dukkha, the inherent suffering in life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Understanding these ideas is crucial to ending Samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Achieving enlightenment also puts an end to lobha (greed), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the core of Buddhism are the four noble truths. The first truth is Dukkha, the acknowledgment that life involves suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation, culture holds a pivotal influence. It can often be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually represents. Culture is far from being uniform or a single entity. It isn't a simple, homogenous concept. Broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and inherently misleading. While having an understanding of a culture's general traits can be useful, it's far more effective for a negotiator to grasp the specific relevance of a culture to the negotiation and how its perspectives might influence discussions. When engaging with a different culture, individuals often relate it to their own, prompting inevitable comparisons.\n\nExploring a foreign culture or mindset might involve anything from delving into its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly during negotiations, especially when in a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, if a negotiator is in unfamiliar territory, showing respect for local traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural barriers and advancing the negotiation.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to a national or international divide. Companies often cultivate their own corporate cultures within a nation. For example, a company's culture might stress extended office hours or promote a more relaxed work schedule. Corporate culture manifests in various ways, such as employee dress codes, communication styles (be it direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropic efforts at any level, while others limit them to company-endorsed charities or events. Observing the diversity within American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within different regions of the same company) highlights the varied perspectives that can exist within a societal culture. Some cultures may appear less stratified than American culture and might seem more uniform to outsiders, yet this surface similarity invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial, as they reveal the reasons behind a culture. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony is highly valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly criticize their company or superior to gain an advantage. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle quickly. Considering these general tendencies is essential before entering negotiations. However, it's beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and marks the start of St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This sentiment is similarly embraced by Thomas Aquinas, another thinker under discussion. As both philosophers defend the notion of God's existence, our task is to evaluate which argument is superior. To maintain focus, we will assume they both correctly advocate for the existence of the biblical God. Introducing a different concept of divinity would hinder our ability to adequately compare their arguments, as they both address a specific understanding of God. Despite their compelling points, neither offers a comprehensive justification for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. He presents a path to understanding through faith, suggesting that introspection reveals evidence of God. Anselm argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Though his explanation can be complex and unclear, the essence is that the proof of God lies within one's mind. Anselm implies that we need not look beyond our own soul to discover the truth about God, as His existence is evident through what we inherently know to be true. External evidence seems unnecessary, with the concept of faith often invoked in Christian texts to describe accepting beliefs without empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through reason and empirical evidence, independent of faith. This approach is advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of new believers based solely on logical persuasion. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each illustrates that God's existence is a logical necessity. Just as one can infer the characteristics and presence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic alone can lead to the recognition of God.",
            "Authors often employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant themes. Among these techniques, some prove more impactful than others. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes an array of such methods. Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to certain elements and uses them to achieve a similar effect. Notably, Fitzgerald frequently employs this strategy with colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald establishes symbolic meanings for colors like white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke specific feelings or associations with key objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a sense of uniformity to the colors white and gray, with white representing a slightly more refined and upper-class connotation, while gray conveys a sense of age and fading. He introduces these meanings early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8)—indeed, many characters are described in white attire: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only notable departure from white clothing occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further associates these colors with mundane or insignificant subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby's party guests become \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" symbolizing uniformity (28). Additionally, he portrays ordinary individuals or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sufficiently established the meanings of white and gray, he employs them to suggest the insignificance or uniformity of certain subjects. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period without significant references to these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of a distinct character and more of a conventional addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression by surrounding Daisy with these colors, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her wearing a \"white\" dress (115) before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's agriculture thrives due to its pleasant and sunny weather. The region is known for producing a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, along with berries, honey, and peppers. There's a notable demand for organic foods from community-supported agriculture in San Diego, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits. These types of businesses allow landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus enabling recreational use and generating revenue through farm tours and educational activities.  \nOrganic farming not only fills a potentially profitable niche market but also increases biodiversity in plants and wildlife by avoiding chemical use in the soil and water. Nonetheless, organic farming can be pricier than conventional methods since it demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and to enrich the soil without chemicals. Additionally, organic farms often experience higher losses compared to traditional farms and lack the efficiency of larger operations. Practices that benefit wildlife, though not directly related to organic farming, can also add to labor costs, such as planting cover crops, managing grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create habitats with specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, landowners might need financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.  \nThe land selected for this scenario is a parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. Spanning 160 acres, it comprises chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is under review and considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \nNative Americans inhabited this area for countless centuries before it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood production throughout many intervening decades.  \nI chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore realistic options for a small farmer to mitigate costs and maintain wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of potential achievements for someone farming this land, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful, enduring one, filled with a spectrum of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique relationship allows brothers to understand each other deeply, seeing reflections of themselves in one another. In critical moments, the essence of this bond is revealed, whether it leads to positive or negative outcomes. The emotions tied to this relationship often come with significant consequences. Understanding these feelings requires acknowledging the impact they have. When someone looks into their brother's eyes and sees their true self, they perceive themselves in a more genuine light, beyond how others view them. It is through their actions and the resulting consequences that their true character is revealed. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers amid a vividly depicted setting. Their expedition, fraught with conflicting emotions like bitter disappointment and intense pride, ends tragically for one brother. The theme is highlighted through the characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview, heavily influencing his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be traced back to a central emotion: pride. From the outset of their adventures to their final, tragic outing, he harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had envisioned a sibling to share his skills with, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He desired a companion for racing to Horsehead Landing and sitting atop the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, Doodle's frail heart made such activities impossible, shattering the protagonist's dreams. His frustration even led him to consider harming Doodle, pondering smothering him with a pillow. Yet, a smile from Doodle softens his heart, rekindling hope. This moment illustrates that his intent was probably never strong, hinting at an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. Over time, as technology evolved from basic to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, a book, and more recently, a computer, these comparisons have developed over the years. However, when studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe process of handling information begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms then transform this sensory data through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details such as color, orientation, and object edges—where color changes abruptly—to recognize the box. Top-down processing uses this information to quickly identify the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped void in the white area.\n\nAfter some degree of processing, an attention filter evaluates the significance of the signal and decides which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might still notice your name being mentioned, even in a bustling room. There are multiple levels of processing, and attention repeatedly influences the outcomes.\n\nTo process information, the brain must store it first. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information undergoes encoding, which varies for different sensory stimuli. For example, verbal inputs can be encoded by appearance (structurally), sound (phonemically), or meaning (semantically). Once stored, information needs maintenance. Some animal research suggests that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through specific neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained within the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, with some based on human memory retrieval, others inspired by computer science, and yet others rooted in neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, within a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could connect to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial downturn. Joblessness climbed, the housing sector collapsed, and numerous major American corporations faced devastation. This recession lingers today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? Essentially, the crisis was a result of reckless and shortsighted political choices that led banks and companies to issue subprime loans within a fragile financial system. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to back and bundle these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the turmoil spread to the restructured mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as President Clinton sought to extend his tenure by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, his administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of The New York Times noted, \"Fannie Mae, the country's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may encounter difficulties in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier and as Holmes anticipated, poor lending practices were bound to trigger an economic collapse.\n\nVarious elements combined to send the economy into a downward spiral, one being the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets overextending themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered greatly. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—the part of your narrative that can either be a soaring showcase of your writing talents or the segment that causes readers to drift off or abandon your work altogether. Dr. Merlin, for instance, often finds herself exasperated when encountering excessive details, particularly when they aren't engaging.\n\nExposition can be a tricky element.\n\nMost seasoned readers are familiar with the advice to \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin occasionally ends up with lengthy sections where little happens, or too much does. Exposition is that mischievous voice that suggests explaining the background to get to the exciting parts (distinct from the other voice that insists on detailing every aspect of each character's past).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, generally through straightforward prose. In movies, it occurs when one character relays a significant amount of information to another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author who conveys this information.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine reading a story where you're informed that the heroine met her partner at a specific place and time, they married in a grand ceremony, and then her husband was tragically killed in front of her. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to be condensed into two pages, with minimal dialogue. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showcasing his love through his actions and words, and similarly, you'd want to see how the heroine's life was enriched by his presence. A detailed portrayal of the husband's character would allow you to feel invested in his fate and offer insights into the heroine's personality: what she cherished in him, the strength of their connection, and glimpses into her thoughts and dreams mirrored through his perspective. This emotional depth would make you grieve his loss alongside her, deepening your connection to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you'd anticipate a richer narrative beyond the bare storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's crucial to add depth to your story. (*considers metaphor, continues undeterred*) It's sometimes tempting to gloss over certain elements. Maybe you're introducing a new character, and you know he once served in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, was married twice, has no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly hopes to own the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, broadcast live, was NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story involved a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife, although her name wasn't mentioned. They showed his mug shot, which portrayed him as quite menacing. The coverage of this developing story lasted about two minutes, which seemed appropriate. The details shared were limited to the fact that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody.\n\nThe second segment covered a shooting incident involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. He was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area, with no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was looking into the matter. The brevity of this report stood out, possibly because it involved a black individual in a predominantly black neighborhood. It has been my observation over the years that crimes involving minority victims do not receive the same level of attention as those involving white individuals. For instance, when a white child or adult is kidnapped or harmed, the media coverage is extensive, whereas minority cases often receive minimal mention.\n\nAnother story discussed a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The report included details about the location of the incident, identifying the bullet as a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a reward of five thousand dollars for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe forecast segment outlined rain and thunderstorms expected on Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures predicted to be in the mid to low eighties. Although brief, this segment seemed intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nCoverage also included a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect, described as a dark-skinned black man, was wearing a hoodie. He was approximately six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The emphasis on his skin color and its darkness seemed unusually pronounced.\n\nAnother report featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating he received a 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months,\" possibly to make it sound harsher. They also highlighted that he was Hispanic, a detail that appeared irrelevant to the core of the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment vehicle that aims to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or collection of assets, much like an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs offer greater flexibility because they can be bought and sold like individual stocks on an exchange. One of the advantages of ETFs is that they combine the broad market exposure of index funds with the flexibility of stock trading, allowing investors to engage in practices such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing in small quantities, even as little as a single share. While these features are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs incurs commission fees similar to those associated with stock trades. Additionally, ETFs provide a vast array of fund choices. Despite these advantages, a prudent investor should critically assess whether the proclaimed benefits, like diversification, are truly present and to what degree. For this discussion, we will analyze the ETF IHF by comparing it with its top 10 underlying holdings, aiming to evaluate if owning a single ETF can match the benefits of holding a diversified set of the ten individual stocks. We will also explore if there are alternative configurations of these stocks that could yield a more favorable Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo streamline the analysis, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF’s total assets. These holdings and their respective asset percentages are outlined below.\n\nBy examining the proportion of assets attributed to these ten stocks and adjusting them to a normalized 100%, we can estimate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these stocks in the same proportions as those in the ETF. The chart below details the calculated Beta and return.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio restricted to the top 10 holdings achieves a return that is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, translating to a 16% improvement in returns. Furthermore, the Beta of these top ten holdings is lower by 0.12 compared to the ETF overall. The findings suggest that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a reduced Beta. Nonetheless, it's possible that the average returns of these two portfolios do not differ significantly in statistical terms. To determine the statistical significance of any differences, we calculate and normalize the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks to 100%, allowing us to compare their collective standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Examining Figure 17, it becomes evident that there was a significant decline in the submissions of commuter logs during the project's third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and pinpointing the exact cause is challenging. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely contributes to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, which could partially explain the drop-off. December also signifies the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when individuals are engrossed in completing assignments, grading, and other academic tasks. Consequently, logging commutes might not have been a priority for many. Moreover, December ushers in the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, possibly another reason for the low log entries that month. Nevertheless, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It's plausible that projects like this start with enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counteract this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign aimed at revitalizing the project, which resulted in an increase in log submissions. Thus, a key challenge was sustaining project momentum amid a natural dip in engagement and the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education.\n\nAnother obstacle for this or any alternative commuting project is the widespread preference for the autonomy and convenience of driving personal vehicles, a deeply ingrained cultural norm. Therefore, providing incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We awarded numerous prizes, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a local independent bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been intriguing to observe how offering more substantial prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, might have influenced participation, potentially addressing the drop in engagement. The prize structure remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing the value of the prizes over time might have encouraged continued participation. While the initial gift cards were adequate, announcing additional prizes like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have spurred greater engagement.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, numbering fifteen from the years 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily involved detailing the stylistic elements prevalent in most trick films and investigating the unique characteristics of some of the later works. Typically, trick films from this era are staged, filmed within a static, frontal proscenium setup, avoid camera movement, utilize long and medium shots, and adhere to a strict one shot equals one film principle. However, some films from the start of the twentieth century challenge these norms by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nA key feature shared by trick films is their filming on an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movement of figures or objects. This composition style was prevalent in early filmmaking, rooted in theatrical traditions and, specifically for trick films, in vaudeville and magic performances. The stage setting inherently restricts movement, with figures in trick films typically only moving laterally without advancing towards or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors appear from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow.\n\nThe frontal proscenium format also dictates the use of long shots and occasionally medium shots, with close-ups absent from Edison’s trick films. This mirrors the theatrical and vaudeville custom, where audiences observed the entire act at once, confined within the stage’s borders. As with many early films, actors remain in the middle distance, avoiding movement towards the camera, thus eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films generally conform to the principle that one conceptual shot represents an entire film. This confines their duration to roughly a minute or less, contingent on the frames per second. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic scope, with many focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, vanishing acts, and transformations with minimal storyline. It’s important to note, however, that in a trick film, what appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience may actually consist of several shots seamlessly combined to create illusions of appearing or disappearing. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), closer examination reveals the point where the scene with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt, in his work The Rise of the Gothic Novel, refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" This literary form has been regarded in various ways—some dismiss it, others extol its virtues, and opinions differ on its depth and the 'terrible sublime' quality it purportedly possesses, as observed by Burke. The inception of this genre can be traced back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which blended elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge a new path in literary expression. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical techniques with 'new' naturalistic elements of contemporary novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre harks back to medieval theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term applied to a variety of peoples, styles, and eras, often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated against the backdrop of \"modern\" societal and literary progress. The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which offers readers a more intimate understanding of characters' psychology, is what has allowed the Gothic genre to persist over time, simultaneously appearing outdated and fresh to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nA significant theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. This medieval concept, which encompasses the training of a knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors due to what it symbolizes—the archetypal knight, courageous, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of these qualities in their contemporary society, especially noted by Walpole. By incorporating chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future development of Gothic into Romantic literature, and serves as a means to critique and potentially elevate the present. When Walpole crafted The Castle of Otranto, he was navigating a politically turbulent era, filled with uncertainty about the future. Engulfed in political machinations and arguably unjust accusations, he might have begun to perceive, even if subconsciously, that the moral integrity and innate \"goodness\" associated with the gothic era were absent in the individuals of his own time. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic. Before even encountering Frederic, the reader learns that he embodies numerous chivalric qualities; he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic is portrayed using an abundance of traditional chivalric imagery; most notably, he is a prince who has endured suffering and tragedy, having left and believed to be slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, an exaggeration, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a series of processes that facilitate the movement of goods from the initial customer order through stages such as raw materials acquisition, supply, production, and ultimately distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant, who articulated it as the comprehensive process of organizing, executing, and overseeing operations within the supply chain to effectively fulfill customer demands. This management framework consists of six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which are leveraged by business managers to optimize customer service delivery.\n\nThe production phase marks the beginning of the supply chain journey. It serves as the cornerstone for the entire supply chain operation. During this phase, decisions are made regarding the timing, rationale, location, and method of production. Managers must ascertain customer preferences, which can be achieved by analyzing market trends, as the market serves as a significant indicator of consumer demands. Once managers have evaluated the market and grasped customer needs, they can determine which products to manufacture and the quantities required. Subsequently, decisions are made about the production site, choosing the most suitable plant to achieve the desired volume and quality of goods, ensuring customer satisfaction is prioritized. Once the production site is selected, managers then focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. The production stage is crucial in the supply chain process, where meticulous planning is essential to avoid potential time and financial losses. For instance, during my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, both organizations had detailed layouts and procedures for every facet of the business, from employee attire to receiving shipments. Such structured processes ensure smooth operations and clarity in roles and expectations.\n\nSupply is the second fundamental component of supply chain management. It involves making strategic decisions to define the core capabilities of a facility and forming outsourcing partnerships based on these decisions. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each equipped with different machinery, staff, and expertise. It is the manager's responsibility to determine which division is best suited for various product processes. Additionally, management may opt to outsource tasks to other companies, primarily to enhance velocity. Velocity refers to the ability to deliver quality and adaptability while simultaneously minimizing costs or maintaining low expenditure levels.",
            "Victorian novels are often noted for their meticulous detailing and focus on the upper echelons of society during that era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, depart from this norm. Both incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of their time, to deepen the portrayals of their characters and offer insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\nA striking example from Oliver Twist illustrates this: “And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels frequently use mysterious elements like dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specifics differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, such occurrences often unveil aspects of Oliver's psyche, his suffering, and his understanding of the reality surrounding him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it intensely, as if dreaming, while desperately seeking help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, highlighting his precarious health condition through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The overwhelming nature of the shooting numbs his senses, leaving him unaware of the “unseen hand” that rescues him; he endures his misery again, with pain now tied to fear rather than surprise. This raises questions about whose actions led to his plight, as it certainly wasn't his own doing. The shooting underscores Oliver's powerlessness, showing his inability to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. The text hints at a growing sense of submission in Oliver, as if Fagin’s influence is wearing him down, making him accept his despair and affecting his capacity to respond. Otherwise, it would seem that Oliver would attempt to act, if only to preserve his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. My role was to assist them in the subjects they found challenging, though I was particularly skilled in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in third or fourth grade and having significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, while others were a complete struggle. Despite being of Latino descent, Adrian spoke English perfectly. Our challenges continued until I met his mother while supervising a small group of students left behind during a field trip. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it suddenly became clear: Adrian's issue wasn't with reading itself, but rather with his grasp of the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this insight helped him, but I sincerely hope he's improved.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue prevalent in schools, especially in California. It illustrates how this barrier isn't always apparent. Even a child fluent in spoken English can face significant hurdles in reading. Recognizing the problem is straightforward, but finding solutions is another matter. For Adrian, focused tutoring on English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, was the answer. However, for many children who speak little English, the solution is more complex. No single approach, be it dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes, can solve this issue alone. The key is to integrate all these methods.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is a promising strategy. It's beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers. Despite concerns that such programs are resource-intensive and offer little benefit to the majority, this is a misconception. Implementing these programs universally would benefit all students. The challenge is in execution. Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's impractical. However, there is no reason why we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, or seek answers within their own hearts. Many people embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their families. Yet, some choose to reject these beliefs, insisting there's nothing beyond their personal, self-centered reality. We might adopt a particular set of values, only to later shift to another. Regardless of the path we take, we embark on a journey to define a part of ourselves through our individual views on spirituality. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness into brightness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my dad replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain pounding on the metal roof above as we shared a smoke. The downspouts directed the rain, overwhelming the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, a look that seemed both searching and reminiscent. Over the past few months, he had become thinner, with his clothes hanging loosely on him. His hair had thinned as well, more so than I remembered. He continued to avoid eye contact, staring into the rain. I felt isolated, scared, unable to express to my dad how much I would miss him, fearing that discussing it would make it all too real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in looking out at the rain falling in the June evening.\n\nLater that year, in December, my father passed away, just five days after I turned twenty-two. The treatments hadn't eased his pain but had extended his life slightly beyond what doctors had predicted. I couldn't find any value in prolonging his suffering. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I didn't pray. If God existed, it seemed to me that he had stopped listening long ago.\n\nI didn't want to see him transition from this life to whatever lay beyond, so I chose not to be there. I couldn't witness the end of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I understood him better than anyone else, even better than his family, and knew he wouldn't want his only child witnessing his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even reached out to me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate of Republicanism in its early days. Although primarily an agriculturist, his time in politics and dedication to personal liberty and governance made him a notable figure. Taylor's commitment to an agrarian lifestyle was central to his views on government. His efforts to safeguard and promote what he saw as the noblest profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to establish an exemplary system, free from the constraints of native traditions that could impede the creation of self-governance. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one compromises the rest, diminishing their value. Thus, he argued that these rights should remain untouched by governmental authority. He contended that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" allowed those with strength and cunning to prosper, a situation that civilization should not replicate.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He held firm views on dual morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He identified good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and curb capitalism, believing that a government rooted in these principles would operate justly, even if led by self-interest and greed. He saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions, only deemed negative when it fostered societal divisions that benefited some at the expense of others. A well-structured government was essential to restrain man's inherent evil, requiring vigilant oversight to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike other committed Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly restricted Federal government, granted only the powers explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He understood that a large Federal government could be costly and potentially tyrannical. Nonetheless, he recognized the risks of a straightforward, literal approach and warned that ignoring the framers' intent could lead to corruption. He also regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly defines the nation as a collective of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "I looked down, my mind taking in the scene before me with a detached calmness. Quietly and without emotion, my practiced awareness observed without trying to connect the scene to any larger concept, my mind processing the image I beheld. Thoughts entered and exited my mind almost quicker than they arrived. My consciousness operated so smoothly that it felt as though I had no independent thoughts, just a fluid and active experience of the sight before me. \n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I knew, I bought a book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had been eager to learn drawing since I was six, and the book covers everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One method it suggested was using a square frame to focus on any picture the artist wanted to examine. This approach turned a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a simpler image of a bowl of fruit on a flat surface. \n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awed, and could only stand there in wonder. Picasso had his blue period, Monet had a passion for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters reveled in color. If I aspired to call my perspective Artistic, then here lay the beginnings of my work, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen artistic tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved, my mind's intention taking shape in what might have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled calmly and smoothly, clear and pristine. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. My muscles tensed, my hand more quickly and anxiously hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown object remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet planted firmly, green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned at the offensive bundle of processed materials someone had left for those of us cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and a few more moments of introspection, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly submerged into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "The issue of teenage fatalities in car accidents is a growing concern. Various elements contribute to the alarming statistics associated with young drivers in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of this problem is that teenagers' brains are not fully developed to manage the dangers of driving. Additionally, lack of experience significantly contributes to the issue, leading not just to more fatal accidents but also a higher incidence of rollovers, speeding, and other road mishaps. \n\nMoreover, teenagers are at greater risk when driving with friends, a common scenario. Research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlights a connection between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, states like California have introduced provisional licenses for teens, which impose restrictions on driving hours and carrying minor passengers. However, I believe these measures are merely temporary solutions. The root problem is that young drivers, based on statistical evidence, are generally unprepared to manage the responsibilities and risks of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 might be too young for a full driver's license. His research, discussed by USA Today, indicates that individuals under 19-20 often seek risky thrills. Delaying the age for obtaining a driver's license could reduce these risks as the propensity for thrill-seeking diminishes.\n\nWithout changes, we risk seeing an increase in fatal accidents as more young drivers take to the roads, especially as the children of the Baby Boomer generation become eligible for licenses by 2010. Implementing legislation to address this is relatively straightforward. Schools could still offer driver’s education to start training future drivers, but operating a vehicle could be restricted to those 18 and older. Provisional permits could be granted before full licenses, with a specified number of training hours required. This requirement could align with existing state standards, such as California’s current 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.\n\nConsidering the widespread nature of this issue, uniform national legislation would be a sensible and effective strategy to protect teenagers nationwide. The concept of such legislation is not new, but it is a necessary step.",
            "This document explores three primary aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. Then, it delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting typical traits or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it discusses strategies that teachers in mainstream classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is described as the proficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) interprets auditory information. More specifically, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain cannot properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD typically have normal hearing and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" However, the brain region responsible for distinguishing words or differentiating between speech and background noise does not operate in the usual manner.\n\nThe earliest reference to what would become known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, when it was termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) during studies of children with communicative disorders. In 1954, an Italian research team led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children. Subsequently, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various forms: individuals may struggle to localize or perceive sound in space, have difficulty distinguishing between different \"acoustic events,\" fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm conveyed through vocal tone. Additionally, one sound may mask another, subsequent sound, and individuals might lack the capability to synthesize auditory cues into meaningful interpretations that guide their actions. They may also be challenged in recalling the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a thorough screening, involving \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function.\" This process might be handled by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and other professionals using a variety of measures that assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These evaluations could include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, particularly how individuals respond to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test with a high rate of diagnostic accuracy, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many diagnostic procedures involve presenting patients with multiple, concurrent auditory stimuli, asking them to identify specific items such as a sequence of words or numbers. More advanced diagnostics may involve measuring acoustic signals within the ear and recording the responses to these signals.",
            "I am eager to pursue a career in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, with the aim of assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in crisis. I bring to the field of social work a dedication to service, a deep respect for others, a commitment to ethical practice, and a resolve to foster better relationships while continually enhancing my professional skills. These values are not only essential to the profession of social work but are also deeply significant to me on a personal level.\n\nSince childhood, I've been drawn to helping others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path would best fulfill this aspiration. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems and some adopting less-than-ideal coping strategies. Witnessing these situations influenced my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still unsure of my career direction, I took some time to reflect. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was visibly anxious. She explained that he was trying to escape an abusive home. The next day, he reported his parents to the authorities. Feeling compelled to help, I visited his parents' home and expressed my concerns to the police, mentioning my recent degree in Psychology. The police asked me to speak with the parents as legal intervention was not an option for the teen. In conversation, the parents appeared uneasy and attempted to justify their son’s actions. This experience profoundly impacted me and led me to seriously consider a career in social work, focusing on resolving family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Our society often claims to value individuals, yet paradoxically, pressures them to conform. This contradiction has always puzzled me, as I value my individuality and resist societal pressures to conform. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively opposed social injustice by expressing myself through unique hair colors and clothing, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights through the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, and standing against racism and discrimination. I am committed to promoting social justice and will continue to challenge social injustices wherever I encounter them.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks in the context of insomnia. The biological framework examines inherited genetic factors and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural framework considers environmental interactions and their implications for race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review analyzes insomnia by discussing these frameworks and detailing selected research to elucidate and enhance the understanding of each model. The research explanations and findings are subsequently evaluated to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, disorders related to another mental condition, or those associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas disorders linked to another mental condition relate to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia concerns staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy features cataplexy and/or automatic REM. While Dyssomnias are primarily about sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are related to behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic, heritable, and physiological factors. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that encourage sleep, while inhibition of its firing can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was found to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. An issue or absence of this receptor could impact one's ability to sleep without medication. The sociocultural dimension of this study implies that if the phenotype were inherited, it could manage sleep, and any alteration of the receptor would naturally disrupt sleep, affecting aspects of life such as education, work, and daily activities requiring focus and routine.",
            "I've been attending University Park for around two and a half years now, which amounts to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm in East Halls, located at the far eastern edge of the campus, apart from the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take as long as 25 minutes on foot, particularly in bad weather, which is common in State College. A conversation with a recent alum revealed that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated by large expanses of unused land. Today, those areas have been developed into sports fields, significant new structures such as the new Creamery and health services building, and are now encircled by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What could be the most effective solution for mobility issues on a college campus? The answer lies in bicycles. However, simply having bikes won't resolve the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists' needs.  \nA friend of mine, who recently started biking again after several years, brought up an interesting point. He said, \"Bikes are fantastic. For a while, it wasn't considered cool to ride one, but it's really the best way to get around.\" Besides promoting physical fitness, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I currently live off-campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was purchasing a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a good twenty-five-minute walk from where I live. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. The challenge lies in Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my home, which can be difficult to navigate, with or without a bike. While walking has its advantages, my schedule is too packed for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my day for a walk to Thomas. That equates to over two and a half hours each week. On top of that, there’s all the additional walking time to other classes and appointments. It's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In the novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist framework that supports it by depicting a dystopian society. In this world, the collective is prioritized over the individual, and from birth, people are conditioned to seek immediate gratification above everything else. The citizens are portrayed as mere instruments in a larger scheme, adhering to a single ideology as directed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism regarding the evolution of these systems. Terms commonly used in Marxism, such as hegemony and reification, bolster the notion that Huxley's work critiques the flaws of the economic landscape of his era.\n\nCapitalism is caricatured through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary citizens are kept from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control of the working class, made evident by the conditioning in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy; hypnopaedia intensifies their urge to consume, spend, and indulge. This manipulation is orchestrated, as mentioned, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the complete dominance of social groups by another, is clearly applied here. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology supporting this structure, namely capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes can recognize it but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, aside from characters like Bernard, challenge their status. The interactions among social classes, as will be further examined, highlight capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between different individuals do not exist. The novel seemingly avoids distinguishing characters—even major ones lack depth. Huxley might be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent; interactions are superficial, depicted through the way men talk about women, focusing mainly on their physical attributes, and women openly discuss their experiences. Moreover, each class's contentment with their hierarchical placement reveals capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their strict adherence to their communal roles reflects Marxist views on the proletariat, who are mistakenly convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A central topic of intense debate in the class was the perception of Islam as either a peaceful or hostile religion. I find this question even more pertinent today than before. Reflecting on the period since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam—from an initially antagonistic stance towards Islamic extremism to a more tolerant approach within America. In 2001, it seemed unlikely to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has connections to Islam.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it contradicts his portrayed character. Previously, I believed Muhammad compelled people to embrace Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion upon them. However, the biography presents Muhammad as a misunderstood figure, almost martyr-like, who humbly engaged with others. It describes how individuals gradually recognized the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking resemblances between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad. A notable example is when he allegedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style suggests that the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a modest prophet who embodied truth and performed miracles without needing to prove himself. I find this problematic as it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly borrowing from Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, numerous stories in the biography seem designed to demonstrate instances of voluntary conversion to Islam. Yet, many of these accounts appear to be third-hand, with the author recounting hearsay from various sources. This approach, intended to validate the stories, actually makes them seem less credible and more dubious to me.\n\nWhat concerns me most about this biography is its attempt to portray Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical accounts often challenge the notion of Muhammad as gentle and humble, leading me to question whether Muslims today are aware of the full history behind Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his lifetime. If we examine this history on a broad scale, we notice a tendency for Christianity to drift further from its roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and an unprecedented push towards progressiveness. While there are still traditionalists who resist new ways of thinking beyond what they've been taught, this group may not have enough influence to sway the majority. Within the Christian community, there will be a significant increase in historical awareness in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to separate the doctrines added over time from the original intent of Christianity's namesake. Although this may take decades or even centuries, the result is inevitable: a significant shift back to the original form of Christianity. A movement will emerge to peel back layers of doctrine, as if time is being reversed, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced on behalf of God remains, untouched by subsequent claims. As this movement spreads across the United States and Europe, inspiring people to worship as if in Jesus' time, adhering strictly to his teachings, the church will remain strong to guide this transformation. However, as theological perspectives regress, the diversity within Christianity will diminish into greater uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and all divisions, there will be a trend towards similarity rather than difference. History is marked by significant reversals. One example is the early persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian stronghold. Our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversal will take place within Christianity, seeking to undo history and diversity in pursuit of its origins. An essential part of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? By looking far back into history, we find the beginnings of Christianity in Judaism, which laid the foundation with monotheism, the notion of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures, all established by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was not united, as it was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a broad spectrum of common people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest that lie within human nature. People tend to prioritize their own well-being and prosperity, often neglecting those who are less fortunate. This theme is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. Their primary focus is on expanding and enhancing their businesses, disregarding the impact on others or the harm their progress may cause. Upton Sinclair's depiction of the industrial landscape underscores this disregard: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the environmental destruction resulting from pollution and the lack of concern for both people and animals affected by it. The factory owners show no remorse for the smoke and waste produced by their operations.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers exhibit little concern for their employees, who toil to generate their wealth. They pursue profit at all costs, sacrificing loyalty and decency: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long hours and face abrupt layoffs without compensation or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" few, if any, laws existed to protect workers' safety or welfare, allowing management to exploit their labor under harsh conditions. Although not explicitly stated, those who toiled and perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the dire circumstances both in and out of the workplace. No organizations existed to support or inform workers, and while unions emerged, they often exacerbated the plight of the laborers by profiting from their struggles. The workers were so oppressed and trapped within the Packingtown system that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finer poetic creations. Within this poem, Poe makes use of the term \"Thulé,\" a reference found in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil employed this term to describe an island located to the north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil's use of the term is well-documented, it's important to note that there is a more contemporary influence on Poe's work. Poe showed a keen interest in German authors.\n\nThis particular reference underscores Poe's awareness of Goethe's literary contributions. In his book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt highlights the parallels between their two poems, suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was an esteemed writer, known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—first in 1808 and later in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem recounts the story of a king whose wife passes away, leaving him a goblet as a gift. Grief-stricken, the king becomes consumed by heavy drinking and sorrow. In his final moments, he bequeaths his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He then approaches a cliff, hurls the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and meets his own end. The demeanor of the King of Thulé closely resembles that of the figure in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's inclusion of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe refers to Thule on two occasions in his body of work. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but uses the term twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. Viewed collectively, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's landscape as dark and solitary, haunted by the specters of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with the themes in Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his desire to rule or live. The poem's atmosphere suggests that the narrator has entered Goethe's literary world.\n\nGoethe was a prominent figure in literature, and Poe would have been familiar with his work, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe once remarked on his respect for Tennyson. Beyond this connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's writings through the numerous reproductions that emerged following the initial publication.",
            "Under the legal framework of California, could a shopper who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket potentially receive punitive damages by arguing that the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill but not addressing it for thirty minutes because he was having his dinner? It seems unlikely that a judge would immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To argue for such an award, a plaintiff must present evidence showing that the defendant's actions were taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their conduct could cause, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could assert that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning up the spill, given that other customers had suffered injuries from slipping in the months leading up to Palmer's accident at D&D. Despite this awareness, Martin neglected to ensure the spill was cleaned up. Palmer's claim that Martin’s actions were despicable might be less convincing, yet it remains reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still didn't take proper steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 p.m., Rich Wayne, an employee at D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin, however, responded that he was on his dinner break and couldn't attend to customer complaints. At 5:15 p.m., another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, receiving the same response. At 5:30 p.m., the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. In the year 2009, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D. Now, Palmer is pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the consideration is on whether to submit a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute specifies malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have deemed conduct as malicious when done with a conscious disregard for a plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was a persistent feeling of yearning within her, an unfulfilled desire that had taken root around the age of 14, as she stepped into her teenage years. Even three years later, at 17, this feeling lingered. She had concluded that her longing was for a person, not an object. Yet, no boys had captured her interest. Some had shown attraction towards her, trying awkwardly to win over her seemingly unyielding heart, but none sparked her interest. She often pondered this puzzling situation, wondering what could lead a teenage girl to feel this way. Despite years of introspection, she had developed theories but nothing substantial enough to consider seriously. So, she continued her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nTypically, days spent at home were serene. Her parents were gentle and composed, rarely engaging in disagreements with each other, and seldom with her. The only disputes arose from her asserting her independence and spirited nature. Though born to a calm couple, she balanced their tranquility with her vibrant personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her quite likable.\n\nHowever, today was an exception to the usual calm. As she moved from one room to another, seeking fresh inspiration, a sudden scream from the kitchen interrupted the tranquility. It was her mother's familiar voice. Startled, she dashed into the kitchen, anxiety building as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, are you okay?!\" There, she found her mother on the floor, wincing and repeatedly uttering \"Ow\" with labored breaths. Rushing to her side, she placed a reassuring hand on her mother, who managed to say, \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words were forced and breathy, and her daughter could tell her mother was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where you need support.\" Her mother indicated, and at that moment, the daughter felt grateful for her strength training. She lifted her mother into the car, gently laid her in the backseat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital greeted them with the familiar blend of antiseptic and anxiety, yet she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She hurriedly brought her mother inside, calling for medical help. Concerned staff quickly gathered, placing her mother on a rolling bed and whisking her away for immediate attention, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a stepping stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf in their home.",
            "The objective of this research was to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with a decreased likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as mortality from stroke. The aMed diet is an altered form of the Med diet, emphasizing a greater intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (rather than saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have highlighted an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Moreover, an intervention trial established that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in aiding weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, past research did not specifically address stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes and were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Instances of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified as such. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin consumption, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and more accurately reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could interfere with results) by taking into account age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nStronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (including both fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile faced a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in the movie Juno, stands solitary at a street corner, gripping a cardboard sign with those unsettling words scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, which is also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw its first significant public demonstrations in a decade. These were spearheaded by numerous Burmese monks and came to be known as the “Saffron Revolution,” named after the saffron-colored robes the monks wore. Initially, the government reluctantly permitted the peaceful protests, but as the public's involvement grew, tensions intensified. The situation escalated into what many viewed as a conflict between the monks and the military, with the junta raiding monasteries across the nation. Foreign journalists were detained, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, merely for attending a protest. While official reports claim 13 fatalities, Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, suggested that the actual number of deaths was much higher, potentially in the thousands.\n\nThese acts of brutality are not unprecedented. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress opposition to maintain control. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their absolute authority. Similarly, Japanese emperors were seen as deities destined to guide their people. In the contemporary era, President George W. Bush reportedly held regular discussions with Ted Haggard, the leader of an organization named Stupid People Worldwide, affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nHistorical cases of such repression include the June 4, 1989, protests at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, workers, and students rallied against government authoritarianism. The death toll from this event varies, with Chinese government estimates at 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Another grim example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, during which Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, executed a systematic massacre targeting Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. The atrocities committed under Hitler’s ‘Third Reich,’ during which Jews were systematically exterminated across several countries, represent another extreme case of such oppression.",
            "Duke Ellington's remarkable impact on jazz is largely attributed to his enduring career and his innovative skill in orchestrating his band. While Ellington's piano presence is understated in many of the pieces chosen for this analysis, his prowess as a composer shines through his ability to craft intricate and layered compositions that highlighted his band members' talents. He constructed a musical environment where soloists could improvise freely while also composing tightly orchestrated segments that leveraged each musician's unique style to bring out musical concepts. Through this approach, he accentuated the orchestra's overall tone, creating unified and original melodies tailored to each piece. His exceptional understanding of individual musicians' sounds, combined with their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble, allowed him to produce some of jazz's most imaginative and outstanding works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when exploring Ellington's distinctive sound and inventiveness, points to Creole Love Call as an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early piece illustrates Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color independent of lyrics. Creole Love Call also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing his soloists' styles, a characteristic evident throughout his career. This deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds through six choruses, as follows:\n\nChorus 1: Features a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a coarser tone by the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo expands on the main melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo is supported by a discreet syncopated piano line.\nChorus 4: The entire band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece reaches its climax as the reeds initiate the call and response in a higher register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Revisits the first chorus's structure, with call and response between voice and reeds. Here, the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, performing as an instrument.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant, novel trombone ending.\n\nEllington's integration of voice to enhance the tonal diversity of the piece exemplifies a stylistic characteristic that permeates his body of work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington blends his tight orchestration skills with his sensitivity to tone color. The piece features a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, intertwining Miley’s vocal-like trumpet playing with Cox’s instrumental vocal style to create a complex and harmonious sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further explores these ideas, with Ellington using Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone to great effect.",
            "What causes organisms to evolve in the ways they do? Are there particular limitations or factors that guide evolutionary changes? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" a statement that holds true today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been increasingly applied to various aspects of mollusk shell formation throughout both individual development and evolutionary history (such as in the work of Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum species, combined with experimental studies, can help clarify the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. By using X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that could model both hypothetical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We then created models of hypothetical shell forms to explore the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of large-scale evolutionary events in this group.\n\nThink of a shell as a tube moving through 360 degrees of space over time. The turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, the columella, runs through the shell's central column. Whorls can expand at different speeds, and they are separated by a line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, also known as the body whorl. The spire includes all the whorls except for the last one. The spire’s tip is the apex, and the opposite end is called the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening termed the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" way to view a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nTo count whorls, one starts by looking at the shell from the apical view and identifying where the first suture begins. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and approximated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of openings that move through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates for the center of each whorl’s aperture along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented in both graphical and mathematical forms. Once a mathematical model is constructed, it's possible to adjust the parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell-forming process.",
            "In Indonesia, the rates of neonatal and infant mortality have not seen significant changes over the past decade. The country is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation. However, the necessary advancements in child and maternal health are not being achieved at the pace required to meet the targets set for 2015. The reasons for these deficiencies will be elaborated on, highlighting the importance of enhancing the overall health system instead of focusing solely on specific program interventions.\n\nThere have been advancements in ensuring skilled health workers are present at births, with 72% of deliveries now attended by such professionals. However, this figure also includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who are not equipped to handle medical complications during childbirth, contributing to the high number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Therefore, while progress in this area is reflected in the statistics, it presents a somewhat deceptive picture, indicating that substantial efforts are still needed. Moreover, there is a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving treatment from healthcare professionals. Although comprehensive data on postnatal care is lacking, it is evident that this remains a significant concern nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates are lower than expected, approximately 4%. This statistic also highlights another issue: the disparity in healthcare access between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, the cesarean section rate is 7%, compared to just 2% in rural regions, underscoring the uneven distribution of healthcare services. Additionally, there is a noticeable gap in healthcare service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest segments of the population, with a 27% difference, indicating that the poor face greater barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to the financial burden involved.\n\nWhen considering the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to effectively address the shortfall in service provision. Should Indonesia implement specific program strategies or focus on strengthening the health system as a whole without centering on maternal and child healthcare before and after pregnancy? Program-specific strategies are appealing as they offer targeted and manageable objectives, often yielding quicker results. However, there are potential drawbacks. A significant concern is that concentrating resources on one area can divert funding from other sectors, leading to an imbalance in resource allocation (as seen with the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning services). Moreover, running several parallel programs can lead to service duplication and a lack of coordination, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and fund management.",
            "Over the past century, the landscape of Popular Music has expanded to encompass countless genres, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even further subdivisions. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably evolved into one of the most varied and expressive categories of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a broad spectrum of emotions, albeit often leaning toward the more somber end. In terms of diversity, soon after its inception, the genre's inherent flexibility was recognized, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has reached a level of diversity where pinpointing a precise definition of what constitutes heavy metal is challenging. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet like all things, it originated from a specific point. To fully appreciate the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends being just a genre.\n\nIn various respects, metal is a movement characterized by its dark themes. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, volume, intensity, and theatricality. It moves away from primitiveness, showcasing skilled musicianship; members of metal bands are adept with their instruments, and this expertise is evident in their music. Unsurprisingly, metal is also a movement with significant drug influences. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental music, with artists using substances as a catalyst for creating groundbreaking and otherworldly records. Metal's dark and visceral qualities stood out in the music scene, contrasting with the predominantly lighter themes in popular music. Later metal generations drew inspiration from the dark and intense elements that were prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics reflecting this darkness are emblematic of the movement, such as those by Byrne.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles showcase their darker side, depicting a tumultuous experience often associated with drug use. This track is sometimes cited as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a Rolling Stones track that also explored heavier, darker themes. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the intensity of the Stones, leading to the inclusion of this song on The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist movement captured imaginations with its dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was already weaving his own visions, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only portrays a woman marveling at the wonders of an unfamiliar dreamscape but also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. From the beginning of his journey, Rousseau longed for recognition and acclaim from the art world he cherished, yet he grappled with an internal struggle to achieve this dream. The Dream encapsulates his enduring conflict: should he adhere to established artistic norms to gain acceptance, or should he forge his own path with a distinct and independent style?\n\nUnderstanding The Dream requires a glimpse into Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau hailed from a modest background; his father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who experienced some degree of prosperity (Shattuck 47). Without formal artistic training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, or toll service employee, until he was forty, though he was inaccurately referred to as a customs inspector, or douanier (Shattuck 46). The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, after the deaths of eight infant children, left him with one surviving daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a new beginning, he turned to painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized rural life, Rousseau remained true to his roots, embodying the hopes and dreams of an ordinary person of his social class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance in the art community is understandable given his circumstances: he lacked formal education in painting, started his career later in life, and was overshadowed by more prominent artists of his time. Despite years of effort, it wasn’t until the emergence of artists like Matisse that Rousseau began gaining recognition. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, their motivations and methods were distinct. While Matisse feared falling into cliché, Rousseau aspired to create works so traditional that he would be welcomed by the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "Numerous philosophers have explored the close relationship between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I am convinced there is a fundamental reason for this connection. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding is gained through education or experience, yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics more intuitively, without conventional instruction. Ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our discussions on morality and beauty primarily focus on explaining why a piece of art or a deed is admirable, rather than setting guidelines for assessing or producing good art or moral conduct.\n\nFurthermore, critiques of art or morality often fall short of truly encapsulating what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or its cultural significance, but ultimately, these elements do not fully account for its artistic merit. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before offering a more detailed analysis. I contend that the essence of art and morality cannot be entirely captured by describing their attributes. Flannery O'Connor once remarked, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we analyze a literary work, there remains an indescribable quality. I believe ethics shares this trait. Wittgenstein observed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this indescribable \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that is the most potent feature of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI propose that the profound connection between morality and art stems from how we experience both on a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. They affect us in ways that are felt deeply yet are hard to completely articulate. This link is particularly strong in the realm of literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a formidable nation, characterized by a rich tapestry of culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic coast in Kiel. This cultural essence is similarly present from Cologne along the Rhine, through Germany’s heartland, reaching the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It is only natural that contemporary Germany's identity is rooted in a variety of different origins and tribes.\n\nThe land known as Germania is the ancestral home of the German people. The etymology of its name is a subject of debate among scholars and historians. According to Tacitus, the term originated from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to confront the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the term “Germanus” in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he recounted subduing the Gauls and engaging with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under questionable pretenses. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. Although the origin remains uncertain, some suggest it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar remarks: “The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, with whom the Gauls are in perpetual conflict... They engage with the Germans in almost daily skirmishes.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Some propose that the name derives from the spear, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” indicating the Germans' loud demeanor (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” the early Roman historian Tacitus described the origins of the Germans, stating, “I would consider [the Germans] as native and unmixed with other races through either migration or intermarriage. In earlier times, it was by sea, not by land, that immigrants arrived... Who would leave Asia or Africa, or even Italy, for Germany, with its harsh landscapes, severe climate, and grim customs, unless it was truly their home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They ventured into Germanic lands for resources and conducted occasional military campaigns, but ultimately, they returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they settled along the Roman Empire’s borders, trading their land-derived goods and offering their expertise by serving in the Roman military (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the use of disguise can be quite effective for maintaining deception over time. However, ultimately, one must abandon this false identity to avoid losing their true self. The challenge in ending a deception is the potential alienation it may cause. Thus, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may react neutrally to the realization of being deceived, others may not be as forgiving and could take offense at the deception.\n\nThe theme of deception, particularly in the context of reversing gender roles, introduces additional complexities. A critical question arises: why does someone feel compelled to abandon their identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? Viola’s situation provides an example of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels the need to disguise herself as a man for protection against potential threats. Although her strategy succeeds, it isolates her from the women around her, severing a crucial support network. Compounding the situation, her male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her, saying, “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nWhile this might appear progressive to contemporary readers, Twelfth Night can be viewed as a narrative where deception unveils hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest that the presence of Viola/Cesario compels these characters to confront unspoken desires. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario purely because of his male appearance, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It can be argued that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare’s portrayal of Olivia seems to satirize individuals of his era who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her romantic interest from Cesario to Sebastian and starts considering Cesario/Viola as family instead of a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial regime has been characterized by various commentators for its harshness, particularly with regard to the atrocity against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with such a broad brush is an oversimplification. The German colonial empire encompassed a range of policies and governance styles, much like its geographic diversity. Educational opportunities within the colonies mirrored this variability. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education were recognized in Kamerun and other colonies by contemporary scholars. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) stood in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the local population, South West Africa largely delegated native education to missionary groups, which received minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up a system of state schools alongside more substantial support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting implications for South West Africa, persisting beyond German rule. While other German colonies featured notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the different experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the dialogue by identifying these factors and focusing on recent research about the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans. There exists an extensive body of literature specifically about education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary objective of early works was to outline the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language writings expanded the discussion through comparative studies of education in various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work that directly addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational frameworks of the two colonies and examines the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of the colony's educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, even though much of the region is arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored its relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that experienced a lengthy rivalry, which lasted 57 years from 1836 to 1893, as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). This tense relationship reached its peak during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, when the United States launched an offensive against Mexico, emerging victorious and acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other confrontations occurred between the two countries, eventually subsiding just before the outbreak of World War I. The origins of this rivalry can be traced back to disagreements over crucial issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as significant material interests, as highlighted by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario is not dissimilar to many other nations worldwide that have ongoing rivalries with neighboring countries. Border-sharing nations frequently encounter conflicting interests, leading to the establishment of adversarial positions. The United States and Mexico exemplify such enduring rivalries between bordering countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations are geographically proximate to the United States and have historically been its rivals, whereas other Latin American countries have typically maintained amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of friction between the two nations, a common historical issue among many countries. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that \"while in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were against Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Much like the Cold War's ideological and interest-based rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, this earlier conflict was rooted not in political systems but in the religious preferences of the two countries. This mutual suspicion stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, a sentiment inherited from their colonial pasts, which posed a considerable challenge in fostering friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry period between Mexico and the United States. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws targeting American border towns were a persistent problem until both countries strengthened their military presence at the borders, as Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry between the nations began to diminish when \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually concluded as American interests transitioned \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) towards the end of the 19th century.",
            "About fifteen years back, an unexpected illness left me suddenly disabled, something I had never imagined. At the time, I was working as a nurse. My career choice was driven by a deep-seated desire for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. Growing up, I often heard the saying, \"People will always need healthcare, so you'll always have a job.\" Although my true aspirations leaned toward becoming a scientist or a journalist, or perhaps both, I decided to pursue nursing.\n\nFast forward to being 46 years old, I found myself single, with no significant savings, and unable to continue working. Today, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing to call my own. I manage to get by, but each day brings challenges that threaten my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite the uncertainty that now characterizes my life, one truth remains: I couldn't have endured these years without the support of my family and a few close friends, no matter how resilient I believed myself to be. In the face of true calamity, feeling strong is rare.\n\nEmergencies, both large and small, are inevitable in life. No matter how prepared we are, some situations are simply too overwhelming to tackle alone. I agree that in the U.S., we need to diversify our reliance beyond big government, which is undeniably crumbling. However, I would prefer to see Americans rebuild trust in each other, fostering a culture of mutual aid rather than isolation.\n\nWhile some US Conservatives praise \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our nation, it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing that sustained our ancestors through tough times. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains reached the coast not by going it alone, but through collective effort.\n\nTherefore, it's wise to be prepared. I am. I have assembled a disaster kit, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. My preparations also include flashlights, various batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the means to cultivate a small farm or preserve your own food, it's advisable. A wood stove is also beneficial, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you make these preparations, remember to connect with your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would eventually become known as the Buddha. Throughout his lifetime, he chose to leave worldly life behind and attained enlightenment, resulting in the creation of Buddhism. The oldest and most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism. This religious tradition has been around for about 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since the time of the Buddha. Such changes are evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where people observe the annual water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious meaning even though the Buddha did not teach any such celebration. These variations are not only visible in surface-level practices but also penetrate the core teachings of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its doctrinal beliefs over time due to various influences, both internal and external, whether they be adversarial or neutral.\n\nIn this discussion, several key terms will be frequently used. The first is the distinction between internal and external forces. Internal forces arise from within the Buddhist community, known as the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status, while external forces come from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm Buddhism, often stemming from negative perceptions of it. Benign forces, on the other hand, neither seek to harm nor aid Buddhism, although they may inadvertently do so. These terms will be discussed repeatedly throughout this exploration.\n\nTo begin, it is essential to examine the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. These philosophical concepts include Anatta, the absence of a permanent self; Dukkha, the inherent suffering in life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Understanding these ideas is crucial to ending Samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Achieving enlightenment also puts an end to lobha (greed), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the core of Buddhism are the four noble truths. The first truth is Dukkha, the acknowledgment that life involves suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation, culture holds a pivotal influence. It can often be defined as much by what it is not as by what it actually represents. Culture is far from being uniform or a single entity. It isn't a simple, homogenous concept. Broad generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are overly simplistic and inherently misleading. While having an understanding of a culture's general traits can be useful, it's far more effective for a negotiator to grasp the specific relevance of a culture to the negotiation and how its perspectives might influence discussions. When engaging with a different culture, individuals often relate it to their own, prompting inevitable comparisons.\n\nExploring a foreign culture or mindset might involve anything from delving into its history to recognizing its biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one should accept it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly during negotiations, especially when in a weaker bargaining position. Similarly, if a negotiator is in unfamiliar territory, showing respect for local traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural barriers and advancing the negotiation.\n\nIt's crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to a national or international divide. Companies often cultivate their own corporate cultures within a nation. For example, a company's culture might stress extended office hours or promote a more relaxed work schedule. Corporate culture manifests in various ways, such as employee dress codes, communication styles (be it direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropic efforts at any level, while others limit them to company-endorsed charities or events. Observing the diversity within American corporate culture from one company to another (and even within different regions of the same company) highlights the varied perspectives that can exist within a societal culture. Some cultures may appear less stratified than American culture and might seem more uniform to outsiders, yet this surface similarity invites deeper exploration.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more crucial, as they reveal the reasons behind a culture. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony is highly valued, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly criticize their company or superior to gain an advantage. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes aggressive bargaining may not rush to settle quickly. Considering these general tendencies is essential before entering negotiations. However, it's beneficial for a negotiator to learn about their counterpart on a personal level to enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God’\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible and marks the start of St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This sentiment is similarly embraced by Thomas Aquinas, another thinker under discussion. As both philosophers defend the notion of God's existence, our task is to evaluate which argument is superior. To maintain focus, we will assume they both correctly advocate for the existence of the biblical God. Introducing a different concept of divinity would hinder our ability to adequately compare their arguments, as they both address a specific understanding of God. Despite their compelling points, neither offers a comprehensive justification for belief in God.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's first consider St. Anselm's basic argument. He presents a path to understanding through faith, suggesting that introspection reveals evidence of God. Anselm argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot truly conceive of His nonexistence. Though his explanation can be complex and unclear, the essence is that the proof of God lies within one's mind. Anselm implies that we need not look beyond our own soul to discover the truth about God, as His existence is evident through what we inherently know to be true. External evidence seems unnecessary, with the concept of faith often invoked in Christian texts to describe accepting beliefs without empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through reason and empirical evidence, independent of faith. This approach is advantageous for evangelism, a key aspect of Christianity, as it allows for the conversion of new believers based solely on logical persuasion. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each illustrates that God's existence is a logical necessity. Just as one can infer the characteristics and presence of a missing puzzle piece without seeing it, logic alone can lead to the recognition of God.",
            "Authors often employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant themes. Among these techniques, some prove more impactful than others. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes an array of such methods. Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create a distinct atmosphere around a topic. At other times, he assigns symbolic meaning to certain elements and uses them to achieve a similar effect. Notably, Fitzgerald frequently employs this strategy with colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald establishes symbolic meanings for colors like white/gray and red/pink, which he later uses to evoke specific feelings or associations with key objects.\n\nFitzgerald assigns a sense of uniformity to the colors white and gray, with white representing a slightly more refined and upper-class connotation, while gray conveys a sense of age and fading. He introduces these meanings early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often depicted \"in white\" (8)—indeed, many characters are described in white attire: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only notable departure from white clothing occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further associates these colors with mundane or insignificant subjects: as Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the names of Gatsby's party guests become \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's timetable, and Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" symbolizing uniformity (28). Additionally, he portrays ordinary individuals or places as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" at the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has sufficiently established the meanings of white and gray, he employs them to suggest the insignificance or uniformity of certain subjects. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period without significant references to these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" prompting readers to perceive her as less of a distinct character and more of a conventional addition, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression by surrounding Daisy with these colors, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her wearing a \"white\" dress (115) before the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's agriculture thrives due to its pleasant and sunny weather. The region is known for producing a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, along with berries, honey, and peppers. There's a notable demand for organic foods from community-supported agriculture in San Diego, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Numerous organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits. These types of businesses allow landowners to benefit from government programs while enhancing habitats, thus enabling recreational use and generating revenue through farm tours and educational activities.  \nOrganic farming not only fills a potentially profitable niche market but also increases biodiversity in plants and wildlife by avoiding chemical use in the soil and water. Nonetheless, organic farming can be pricier than conventional methods since it demands more labor and management to control pests and weeds and to enrich the soil without chemicals. Additionally, organic farms often experience higher losses compared to traditional farms and lack the efficiency of larger operations. Practices that benefit wildlife, though not directly related to organic farming, can also add to labor costs, such as planting cover crops, managing grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create habitats with specific conditions like edge habitats or open ground patches. Therefore, landowners might need financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.  \nThe land selected for this scenario is a parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. Spanning 160 acres, it comprises chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which is under review and considers over a hundred plant and animal species. Many are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \nNative Americans inhabited this area for countless centuries before it was settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent and likely used for grazing and wood production throughout many intervening decades.  \nI chose a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore realistic options for a small farmer to mitigate costs and maintain wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of potential achievements for someone farming this land, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful, enduring one, filled with a spectrum of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. This unique relationship allows brothers to understand each other deeply, seeing reflections of themselves in one another. In critical moments, the essence of this bond is revealed, whether it leads to positive or negative outcomes. The emotions tied to this relationship often come with significant consequences. Understanding these feelings requires acknowledging the impact they have. When someone looks into their brother's eyes and sees their true self, they perceive themselves in a more genuine light, beyond how others view them. It is through their actions and the resulting consequences that their true character is revealed. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers amid a vividly depicted setting. Their expedition, fraught with conflicting emotions like bitter disappointment and intense pride, ends tragically for one brother. The theme is highlighted through the characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview, heavily influencing his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's behavior can be traced back to a central emotion: pride. From the outset of their adventures to their final, tragic outing, he harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had envisioned a sibling to share his skills with, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He desired a companion for racing to Horsehead Landing and sitting atop the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, Doodle's frail heart made such activities impossible, shattering the protagonist's dreams. His frustration even led him to consider harming Doodle, pondering smothering him with a pillow. Yet, a smile from Doodle softens his heart, rekindling hope. This moment illustrates that his intent was probably never strong, hinting at an inherent love for his brother.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and imaginative system for processing information. Over time, as technology evolved from basic to advanced, so did the metaphors used to describe the brain. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then to papyrus, a book, and more recently, a computer, these comparisons have developed over the years. However, when studying the brain, it's important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe process of handling information begins with input from sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The brain's algorithms then transform this sensory data through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing compiles basic details such as color, orientation, and object edges—where color changes abruptly—to recognize the box. Top-down processing uses this information to quickly identify the object as a black box instead of a box-shaped void in the white area.\n\nAfter some degree of processing, an attention filter evaluates the significance of the signal and decides which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, a functional attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might still notice your name being mentioned, even in a bustling room. There are multiple levels of processing, and attention repeatedly influences the outcomes.\n\nTo process information, the brain must store it first. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information undergoes encoding, which varies for different sensory stimuli. For example, verbal inputs can be encoded by appearance (structurally), sound (phonemically), or meaning (semantically). Once stored, information needs maintenance. Some animal research suggests that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal cycling through specific neurons briefly. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained within the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, with some based on human memory retrieval, others inspired by computer science, and yet others rooted in neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relatedness. For example, within a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could connect to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe financial downturn. Joblessness climbed, the housing sector collapsed, and numerous major American corporations faced devastation. This recession lingers today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent it? Essentially, the crisis was a result of reckless and shortsighted political choices that led banks and companies to issue subprime loans within a fragile financial system. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were urged to back and bundle these mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS). When borrowers defaulted, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the turmoil spread to the restructured mortgages they had sold, impacting the broader economy.\n\nThe crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as President Clinton sought to extend his tenure by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, his administration eased lending restrictions, setting the stage for the subprime crisis that would unfold seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of The New York Times noted, \"Fannie Mae, the country's largest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the potential fallout: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may encounter difficulties in an economic downturn, leading to a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier and as Holmes anticipated, poor lending practices were bound to trigger an economic collapse.\n\nVarious elements combined to send the economy into a downward spiral, one being the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely utilized in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets overextending themselves in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities suffered greatly. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, representing roughly 30% of the nation's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at low prices, Lehman Brothers was dissolved, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—the part of your narrative that can either be a soaring showcase of your writing talents or the segment that causes readers to drift off or abandon your work altogether. Dr. Merlin, for instance, often finds herself exasperated when encountering excessive details, particularly when they aren't engaging.\n\nExposition can be a tricky element.\n\nMost seasoned readers are familiar with the advice to \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin occasionally ends up with lengthy sections where little happens, or too much does. Exposition is that mischievous voice that suggests explaining the background to get to the exciting parts (distinct from the other voice that insists on detailing every aspect of each character's past).\n\nExposition involves informing the audience about events, generally through straightforward prose. In movies, it occurs when one character relays a significant amount of information to another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author who conveys this information.\n\nTo illustrate, imagine reading a story where you're informed that the heroine met her partner at a specific place and time, they married in a grand ceremony, and then her husband was tragically killed in front of her. You wouldn't anticipate this entire narrative to be condensed into two pages, with minimal dialogue. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showcasing his love through his actions and words, and similarly, you'd want to see how the heroine's life was enriched by his presence. A detailed portrayal of the husband's character would allow you to feel invested in his fate and offer insights into the heroine's personality: what she cherished in him, the strength of their connection, and glimpses into her thoughts and dreams mirrored through his perspective. This emotional depth would make you grieve his loss alongside her, deepening your connection to her journey.\n\nIn essence, you'd anticipate a richer narrative beyond the bare storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's crucial to add depth to your story. (*considers metaphor, continues undeterred*) It's sometimes tempting to gloss over certain elements. Maybe you're introducing a new character, and you know he once served in the Air Force, now manages a gas station at night, was married twice, has no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly hopes to own the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, broadcast live, was NBC 4 on the morning of August 13, 2011. The main story involved a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife, although her name wasn't mentioned. They showed his mug shot, which portrayed him as quite menacing. The coverage of this developing story lasted about two minutes, which seemed appropriate. The details shared were limited to the fact that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been taken into custody.\n\nThe second segment covered a shooting incident involving an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. He was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area, with no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was looking into the matter. The brevity of this report stood out, possibly because it involved a black individual in a predominantly black neighborhood. It has been my observation over the years that crimes involving minority victims do not receive the same level of attention as those involving white individuals. For instance, when a white child or adult is kidnapped or harmed, the media coverage is extensive, whereas minority cases often receive minimal mention.\n\nAnother story discussed a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The report included details about the location of the incident, identifying the bullet as a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a reward of five thousand dollars for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe forecast segment outlined rain and thunderstorms expected on Saturday afternoon, with weekend temperatures predicted to be in the mid to low eighties. Although brief, this segment seemed intended as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nCoverage also included a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect, described as a dark-skinned black man, was wearing a hoodie. He was approximately six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The emphasis on his skin color and its darkness seemed unusually pronounced.\n\nAnother report featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of stating he received a 25-year prison sentence, they mentioned \"300 months,\" possibly to make it sound harsher. They also highlighted that he was Hispanic, a detail that appeared irrelevant to the core of the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of investment vehicle that aims to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or collection of assets, much like an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs offer greater flexibility because they can be bought and sold like individual stocks on an exchange. One of the advantages of ETFs is that they combine the broad market exposure of index funds with the flexibility of stock trading, allowing investors to engage in practices such as short selling, buying on margin, and purchasing in small quantities, even as little as a single share. While these features are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. On the downside, trading ETFs incurs commission fees similar to those associated with stock trades. Additionally, ETFs provide a vast array of fund choices. Despite these advantages, a prudent investor should critically assess whether the proclaimed benefits, like diversification, are truly present and to what degree. For this discussion, we will analyze the ETF IHF by comparing it with its top 10 underlying holdings, aiming to evaluate if owning a single ETF can match the benefits of holding a diversified set of the ten individual stocks. We will also explore if there are alternative configurations of these stocks that could yield a more favorable Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo streamline the analysis, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which represent 63.58% of the ETF’s total assets. These holdings and their respective asset percentages are outlined below.\n\nBy examining the proportion of assets attributed to these ten stocks and adjusting them to a normalized 100%, we can estimate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these stocks in the same proportions as those in the ETF. The chart below details the calculated Beta and return.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio restricted to the top 10 holdings achieves a return that is 6.11% higher than that of the ETF, translating to a 16% improvement in returns. Furthermore, the Beta of these top ten holdings is lower by 0.12 compared to the ETF overall. The findings suggest that a portfolio of the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a reduced Beta. Nonetheless, it's possible that the average returns of these two portfolios do not differ significantly in statistical terms. To determine the statistical significance of any differences, we calculate and normalize the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks to 100%, allowing us to compare their collective standard deviation against that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Examining Figure 17, it becomes evident that there was a significant decline in the submissions of commuter logs during the project's third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and pinpointing the exact cause is challenging. The arrival of winter at a New England campus likely contributes to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot, which could partially explain the drop-off. December also signifies the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when individuals are engrossed in completing assignments, grading, and other academic tasks. Consequently, logging commutes might not have been a priority for many. Moreover, December ushers in the busy holiday season and a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many do not need to visit the campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, possibly another reason for the low log entries that month. Nevertheless, this doesn't fully account for the low submissions in February. It's plausible that projects like this start with enthusiasm that wanes over time. To counteract this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign aimed at revitalizing the project, which resulted in an increase in log submissions. Thus, a key challenge was sustaining project momentum amid a natural dip in engagement and the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks typical in higher education.\n\nAnother obstacle for this or any alternative commuting project is the widespread preference for the autonomy and convenience of driving personal vehicles, a deeply ingrained cultural norm. Therefore, providing incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We awarded numerous prizes, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, a local independent bookstore, and some larger national chains. It would have been intriguing to observe how offering more substantial prizes, such as a new bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, might have influenced participation, potentially addressing the drop in engagement. The prize structure remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing the value of the prizes over time might have encouraged continued participation. While the initial gift cards were adequate, announcing additional prizes like bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January could have spurred greater engagement.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to watch all the trick films, numbering fifteen from the years 1895 to 1901. These films cleverly employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily involved detailing the stylistic elements prevalent in most trick films and investigating the unique characteristics of some of the later works. Typically, trick films from this era are staged, filmed within a static, frontal proscenium setup, avoid camera movement, utilize long and medium shots, and adhere to a strict one shot equals one film principle. However, some films from the start of the twentieth century challenge these norms by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nA key feature shared by trick films is their filming on an indoor set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary, not tracking any movement of figures or objects. This composition style was prevalent in early filmmaking, rooted in theatrical traditions and, specifically for trick films, in vaudeville and magic performances. The stage setting inherently restricts movement, with figures in trick films typically only moving laterally without advancing towards or retreating from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors appear from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera does not follow.\n\nThe frontal proscenium format also dictates the use of long shots and occasionally medium shots, with close-ups absent from Edison’s trick films. This mirrors the theatrical and vaudeville custom, where audiences observed the entire act at once, confined within the stage’s borders. As with many early films, actors remain in the middle distance, avoiding movement towards the camera, thus eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films generally conform to the principle that one conceptual shot represents an entire film. This confines their duration to roughly a minute or less, contingent on the frames per second. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic scope, with many focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic, vanishing acts, and transformations with minimal storyline. It’s important to note, however, that in a trick film, what appears as a single conceptual shot to the audience may actually consist of several shots seamlessly combined to create illusions of appearing or disappearing. For instance, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), closer examination reveals the point where the scene with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, despite the film being perceived as a single shot by the viewer.",
            "Ian Watt, in his work The Rise of the Gothic Novel, refers to the \"Gothic Novel\" as an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" This literary form has been regarded in various ways—some dismiss it, others extol its virtues, and opinions differ on its depth and the 'terrible sublime' quality it purportedly possesses, as observed by Burke. The inception of this genre can be traced back to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, which blended elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to forge a new path in literary expression. Walpole incorporated \"old\" theatrical techniques with 'new' naturalistic elements of contemporary novels to craft what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre harks back to medieval theatre, architecture, and customs. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term applied to a variety of peoples, styles, and eras, often viewed as outdated or unsophisticated against the backdrop of \"modern\" societal and literary progress. The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" elements with the novel's format, which offers readers a more intimate understanding of characters' psychology, is what has allowed the Gothic genre to persist over time, simultaneously appearing outdated and fresh to readers far removed from its origins.\n\nA significant theme in Gothic novels is the notion of Chivalry. This medieval concept, which encompasses the training of a knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors due to what it symbolizes—the archetypal knight, courageous, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of these qualities in their contemporary society, especially noted by Walpole. By incorporating chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the future development of Gothic into Romantic literature, and serves as a means to critique and potentially elevate the present. When Walpole crafted The Castle of Otranto, he was navigating a politically turbulent era, filled with uncertainty about the future. Engulfed in political machinations and arguably unjust accusations, he might have begun to perceive, even if subconsciously, that the moral integrity and innate \"goodness\" associated with the gothic era were absent in the individuals of his own time. This notion is evident in characters like Frederic. Before even encountering Frederic, the reader learns that he embodies numerous chivalric qualities; he is depicted as:\n\nFrederic is portrayed using an abundance of traditional chivalric imagery; most notably, he is a prince who has endured suffering and tragedy, having left and believed to be slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, an exaggeration, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management encompasses a series of processes that facilitate the movement of goods from the initial customer order through stages such as raw materials acquisition, supply, production, and ultimately distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant, who articulated it as the comprehensive process of organizing, executing, and overseeing operations within the supply chain to effectively fulfill customer demands. This management framework consists of six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information, which are leveraged by business managers to optimize customer service delivery.\n\nThe production phase marks the beginning of the supply chain journey. It serves as the cornerstone for the entire supply chain operation. During this phase, decisions are made regarding the timing, rationale, location, and method of production. Managers must ascertain customer preferences, which can be achieved by analyzing market trends, as the market serves as a significant indicator of consumer demands. Once managers have evaluated the market and grasped customer needs, they can determine which products to manufacture and the quantities required. Subsequently, decisions are made about the production site, choosing the most suitable plant to achieve the desired volume and quality of goods, ensuring customer satisfaction is prioritized. Once the production site is selected, managers then focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. The production stage is crucial in the supply chain process, where meticulous planning is essential to avoid potential time and financial losses. For instance, during my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, both organizations had detailed layouts and procedures for every facet of the business, from employee attire to receiving shipments. Such structured processes ensure smooth operations and clarity in roles and expectations.\n\nSupply is the second fundamental component of supply chain management. It involves making strategic decisions to define the core capabilities of a facility and forming outsourcing partnerships based on these decisions. A company may have multiple production divisions for a single product, each equipped with different machinery, staff, and expertise. It is the manager's responsibility to determine which division is best suited for various product processes. Additionally, management may opt to outsource tasks to other companies, primarily to enhance velocity. Velocity refers to the ability to deliver quality and adaptability while simultaneously minimizing costs or maintaining low expenditure levels.",
            "Victorian novels are often noted for their meticulous detailing and focus on the upper echelons of society during that era. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, depart from this norm. Both incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are not typical of their time, to deepen the portrayals of their characters and offer insights into their motivations and emotional states.\n\nA striking example from Oliver Twist illustrates this: “And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels frequently use mysterious elements like dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specifics differ in each case. In Oliver Twist, such occurrences often unveil aspects of Oliver's psyche, his suffering, and his understanding of the reality surrounding him. When the incident of Oliver being shot is revisited in chapter 28, he re-experiences it intensely, as if dreaming, while desperately seeking help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, highlighting his precarious health condition through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The overwhelming nature of the shooting numbs his senses, leaving him unaware of the “unseen hand” that rescues him; he endures his misery again, with pain now tied to fear rather than surprise. This raises questions about whose actions led to his plight, as it certainly wasn't his own doing. The shooting underscores Oliver's powerlessness, showing his inability to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at stake. The text hints at a growing sense of submission in Oliver, as if Fagin’s influence is wearing him down, making him accept his despair and affecting his capacity to respond. Otherwise, it would seem that Oliver would attempt to act, if only to preserve his own life.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting ours.”",
            "A few years back, I was involved in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. My role was to assist them in the subjects they found challenging, though I was particularly skilled in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was likely in third or fourth grade and having significant difficulties with reading. I noticed something unusual; he could pronounce some letters flawlessly, while others were a complete struggle. Despite being of Latino descent, Adrian spoke English perfectly. Our challenges continued until I met his mother while supervising a small group of students left behind during a field trip. Adrian's mother spoke only Spanish. Despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it suddenly became clear: Adrian's issue wasn't with reading itself, but rather with his grasp of the English alphabet. I can't say for sure if this insight helped him, but I sincerely hope he's improved.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue prevalent in schools, especially in California. It illustrates how this barrier isn't always apparent. Even a child fluent in spoken English can face significant hurdles in reading. Recognizing the problem is straightforward, but finding solutions is another matter. For Adrian, focused tutoring on English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, was the answer. However, for many children who speak little English, the solution is more complex. No single approach, be it dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, or ESL classes, can solve this issue alone. The key is to integrate all these methods.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, is a promising strategy. It's beneficial not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research shows that children in bilingual programs often outperform their peers. Despite concerns that such programs are resource-intensive and offer little benefit to the majority, this is a misconception. Implementing these programs universally would benefit all students. The challenge is in execution. Should we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's impractical. However, there is no reason why we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to support this initiative.",
            "From a young age, many of us are introduced to the idea that there exists something greater than ourselves, something beyond our understanding. Some attend Sunday school to learn about it, others visit temples, or seek answers within their own hearts. Many people embrace the religious beliefs passed down by their families. Yet, some choose to reject these beliefs, insisting there's nothing beyond their personal, self-centered reality. We might adopt a particular set of values, only to later shift to another. Regardless of the path we take, we embark on a journey to define a part of ourselves through our individual views on spirituality. We seek a guiding light to lead us from darkness into brightness.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my dad replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain pounding on the metal roof above as we shared a smoke. The downspouts directed the rain, overwhelming the plants along the porch's edge. He gazed into the rain, a look that seemed both searching and reminiscent. Over the past few months, he had become thinner, with his clothes hanging loosely on him. His hair had thinned as well, more so than I remembered. He continued to avoid eye contact, staring into the rain. I felt isolated, scared, unable to express to my dad how much I would miss him, fearing that discussing it would make it all too real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in looking out at the rain falling in the June evening.\n\nLater that year, in December, my father passed away, just five days after I turned twenty-two. The treatments hadn't eased his pain but had extended his life slightly beyond what doctors had predicted. I couldn't find any value in prolonging his suffering. I wondered what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I didn't pray. If God existed, it seemed to me that he had stopped listening long ago.\n\nI didn't want to see him transition from this life to whatever lay beyond, so I chose not to be there. I couldn't witness the end of the life that had given me mine. I wanted to remember my father for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I understood him better than anyone else, even better than his family, and knew he wouldn't want his only child witnessing his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nNo one even reached out to me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate of Republicanism in its early days. Although primarily an agriculturist, his time in politics and dedication to personal liberty and governance made him a notable figure. Taylor's commitment to an agrarian lifestyle was central to his views on government. His efforts to safeguard and promote what he saw as the noblest profession influenced his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional matters, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique chance to establish an exemplary system, free from the constraints of native traditions that could impede the creation of self-governance. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one compromises the rest, diminishing their value. Thus, he argued that these rights should remain untouched by governmental authority. He contended that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" allowed those with strength and cunning to prosper, a situation that civilization should not replicate.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He held firm views on dual morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He identified good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and curb capitalism, believing that a government rooted in these principles would operate justly, even if led by self-interest and greed. He saw self-interest as the driving force behind human actions, only deemed negative when it fostered societal divisions that benefited some at the expense of others. A well-structured government was essential to restrain man's inherent evil, requiring vigilant oversight to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike other committed Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a highly restricted Federal government, granted only the powers explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He understood that a large Federal government could be costly and potentially tyrannical. Nonetheless, he recognized the risks of a straightforward, literal approach and warned that ignoring the framers' intent could lead to corruption. He also regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundational document of the United States, as it more clearly defines the nation as a collective of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "I looked down, my mind taking in the scene before me with a detached calmness. Quietly and without emotion, my practiced awareness observed without trying to connect the scene to any larger concept, my mind processing the image I beheld. Thoughts entered and exited my mind almost quicker than they arrived. My consciousness operated so smoothly that it felt as though I had no independent thoughts, just a fluid and active experience of the sight before me. \n\nOnce, following advice from an artist I knew, I bought a book titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had been eager to learn drawing since I was six, and the book covers everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One method it suggested was using a square frame to focus on any picture the artist wanted to examine. This approach turned a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a simpler image of a bowl of fruit on a flat surface. \n\nAt that moment, looking at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally apply the artist’s frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awed, and could only stand there in wonder. Picasso had his blue period, Monet had a passion for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters reveled in color. If I aspired to call my perspective Artistic, then here lay the beginnings of my work, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen artistic tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved, my mind's intention taking shape in what might have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled calmly and smoothly, clear and pristine. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. My muscles tensed, my hand more quickly and anxiously hit the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown object remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet. \n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet planted firmly, green tie uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned at the offensive bundle of processed materials someone had left for those of us cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and a few more moments of introspection, my hand reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly submerged into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "The issue of teenage fatalities in car accidents is a growing concern. Various elements contribute to the alarming statistics associated with young drivers in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of this problem is that teenagers' brains are not fully developed to manage the dangers of driving. Additionally, lack of experience significantly contributes to the issue, leading not just to more fatal accidents but also a higher incidence of rollovers, speeding, and other road mishaps. \n\nMoreover, teenagers are at greater risk when driving with friends, a common scenario. Research from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlights a connection between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, states like California have introduced provisional licenses for teens, which impose restrictions on driving hours and carrying minor passengers. However, I believe these measures are merely temporary solutions. The root problem is that young drivers, based on statistical evidence, are generally unprepared to manage the responsibilities and risks of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 might be too young for a full driver's license. His research, discussed by USA Today, indicates that individuals under 19-20 often seek risky thrills. Delaying the age for obtaining a driver's license could reduce these risks as the propensity for thrill-seeking diminishes.\n\nWithout changes, we risk seeing an increase in fatal accidents as more young drivers take to the roads, especially as the children of the Baby Boomer generation become eligible for licenses by 2010. Implementing legislation to address this is relatively straightforward. Schools could still offer driver’s education to start training future drivers, but operating a vehicle could be restricted to those 18 and older. Provisional permits could be granted before full licenses, with a specified number of training hours required. This requirement could align with existing state standards, such as California’s current 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.\n\nConsidering the widespread nature of this issue, uniform national legislation would be a sensible and effective strategy to protect teenagers nationwide. The concept of such legislation is not new, but it is a necessary step.",
            "This document explores three primary aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, it offers a concise definition of the disorder. Then, it delves into the diagnostic process, highlighting typical traits or \"red flags.\" Lastly, it discusses strategies that teachers in mainstream classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is described as the proficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) interprets auditory information. More specifically, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information within the CNS and the neurobiological activity that supports this processing, leading to electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a condition where the brain cannot properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD typically have normal hearing and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" However, the brain region responsible for distinguishing words or differentiating between speech and background noise does not operate in the usual manner.\n\nThe earliest reference to what would become known as CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, when it was termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) during studies of children with communicative disorders. In 1954, an Italian research team led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children. Subsequently, in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and developed a model to explain the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD can present in various forms: individuals may struggle to localize or perceive sound in space, have difficulty distinguishing between different \"acoustic events,\" fail to recognize sound patterns, or be unable to detect changes in speech, such as sarcasm conveyed through vocal tone. Additionally, one sound may mask another, subsequent sound, and individuals might lack the capability to synthesize auditory cues into meaningful interpretations that guide their actions. They may also be challenged in recalling the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a thorough screening, involving \"systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function.\" This process might be handled by audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and other professionals using a variety of measures that assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These evaluations could include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors, particularly how individuals respond to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single tool or test with a high rate of diagnostic accuracy, and the disorder's cause remains unknown. Many diagnostic procedures involve presenting patients with multiple, concurrent auditory stimuli, asking them to identify specific items such as a sequence of words or numbers. More advanced diagnostics may involve measuring acoustic signals within the ear and recording the responses to these signals.",
            "I am eager to pursue a career in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, with the aim of assisting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and offering support to families in crisis. I bring to the field of social work a dedication to service, a deep respect for others, a commitment to ethical practice, and a resolve to foster better relationships while continually enhancing my professional skills. These values are not only essential to the profession of social work but are also deeply significant to me on a personal level.\n\nSince childhood, I've been drawn to helping others, though I was initially uncertain about which career path would best fulfill this aspiration. During my high school and college years, I observed many people avoiding their problems and some adopting less-than-ideal coping strategies. Witnessing these situations influenced my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, still unsure of my career direction, I took some time to reflect. That summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was visibly anxious. She explained that he was trying to escape an abusive home. The next day, he reported his parents to the authorities. Feeling compelled to help, I visited his parents' home and expressed my concerns to the police, mentioning my recent degree in Psychology. The police asked me to speak with the parents as legal intervention was not an option for the teen. In conversation, the parents appeared uneasy and attempted to justify their son’s actions. This experience profoundly impacted me and led me to seriously consider a career in social work, focusing on resolving family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Our society often claims to value individuals, yet paradoxically, pressures them to conform. This contradiction has always puzzled me, as I value my individuality and resist societal pressures to conform. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively opposed social injustice by expressing myself through unique hair colors and clothing, advocating for LGBTQ+ rights through the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, and standing against racism and discrimination. I am committed to promoting social justice and will continue to challenge social injustices wherever I encounter them.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks in the context of insomnia. The biological framework examines inherited genetic factors and medical health aspects, while the Sociocultural framework considers environmental interactions and their implications for race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review analyzes insomnia by discussing these frameworks and detailing selected research to elucidate and enhance the understanding of each model. The research explanations and findings are subsequently evaluated to highlight their particular strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, disorders related to another mental condition, or those associated with other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, whereas disorders linked to another mental condition relate to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other sleep disorders may arise from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia concerns staying awake, both persisting for at least one month. Narcolepsy features cataplexy and/or automatic REM. While Dyssomnias are primarily about sleep initiation and maintenance, Parasomnias are related to behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder involve sleep challenges due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and, to some extent, on primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic, heritable, and physiological factors. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study conducted on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that encourage sleep, while inhibition of its firing can reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen was found to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that mouse models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. An issue or absence of this receptor could impact one's ability to sleep without medication. The sociocultural dimension of this study implies that if the phenotype were inherited, it could manage sleep, and any alteration of the receptor would naturally disrupt sleep, affecting aspects of life such as education, work, and daily activities requiring focus and routine.",
            "I've been attending University Park for around two and a half years now, which amounts to four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be challenging for many students, myself included. During my freshman year, I was assigned a dorm in East Halls, located at the far eastern edge of the campus, apart from the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations like the Willard building, near the campus center, could take as long as 25 minutes on foot, particularly in bad weather, which is common in State College. A conversation with a recent alum revealed that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated by large expanses of unused land. Today, those areas have been developed into sports fields, significant new structures such as the new Creamery and health services building, and are now encircled by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, moving from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. What could be the most effective solution for mobility issues on a college campus? The answer lies in bicycles. However, simply having bikes won't resolve the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus infrastructure must accommodate cyclists' needs.  \nA friend of mine, who recently started biking again after several years, brought up an interesting point. He said, \"Bikes are fantastic. For a while, it wasn't considered cool to ride one, but it's really the best way to get around.\" Besides promoting physical fitness, cycling is the most efficient mode of transportation. With just a bowl of oatmeal and some physical effort, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I currently live off-campus, just as far from the campus center as some dorms. My smartest decision this year was purchasing a bike. I have a class in the Thomas building every day, which is a good twenty-five-minute walk from where I live. Cycling can reduce that time to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly enough. The challenge lies in Pollock Road, the most direct route to the Thomas building from my home, which can be difficult to navigate, with or without a bike. While walking has its advantages, my schedule is too packed for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only dependable way to get to class, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my day for a walk to Thomas. That equates to over two and a half hours each week. On top of that, there’s all the additional walking time to other classes and appointments. It's more time than I can afford to lose.",
            "In the novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist framework that supports it by depicting a dystopian society. In this world, the collective is prioritized over the individual, and from birth, people are conditioned to seek immediate gratification above everything else. The citizens are portrayed as mere instruments in a larger scheme, adhering to a single ideology as directed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can discern Huxley's skepticism regarding the evolution of these systems. Terms commonly used in Marxism, such as hegemony and reification, bolster the notion that Huxley's work critiques the flaws of the economic landscape of his era.\n\nCapitalism is caricatured through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. Essentially, ordinary citizens are kept from understanding their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This is attributed to the ideological control of the working class, made evident by the conditioning in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy; hypnopaedia intensifies their urge to consume, spend, and indulge. This manipulation is orchestrated, as mentioned, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the complete dominance of social groups by another, is clearly applied here. The lower classes remain oblivious to their manipulation, literally buying into an ideology supporting this structure, namely capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes can recognize it but remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, aside from characters like Bernard, challenge their status. The interactions among social classes, as will be further examined, highlight capitalism's perceived oppression.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between different individuals do not exist. The novel seemingly avoids distinguishing characters—even major ones lack depth. Huxley might be suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent; interactions are superficial, depicted through the way men talk about women, focusing mainly on their physical attributes, and women openly discuss their experiences. Moreover, each class's contentment with their hierarchical placement reveals capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their strict adherence to their communal roles reflects Marxist views on the proletariat, who are mistakenly convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. A central topic of intense debate in the class was the perception of Islam as either a peaceful or hostile religion. I find this question even more pertinent today than before. Reflecting on the period since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam—from an initially antagonistic stance towards Islamic extremism to a more tolerant approach within America. In 2001, it seemed unlikely to have a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose family has connections to Islam.\n\nThe Prophet's biography captivates me because, based on my understanding of Muhammad's history, it contradicts his portrayed character. Previously, I believed Muhammad compelled people to embrace Islam, conquering tribes and imposing the religion upon them. However, the biography presents Muhammad as a misunderstood figure, almost martyr-like, who humbly engaged with others. It describes how individuals gradually recognized the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nAdditionally, there are striking resemblances between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad. A notable example is when he allegedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style suggests that the authors intended to depict Muhammad as a modest prophet who embodied truth and performed miracles without needing to prove himself. I find this problematic as it diminishes the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, seemingly borrowing from Jesus's legacy through Muhammad.\n\nMoreover, numerous stories in the biography seem designed to demonstrate instances of voluntary conversion to Islam. Yet, many of these accounts appear to be third-hand, with the author recounting hearsay from various sources. This approach, intended to validate the stories, actually makes them seem less credible and more dubious to me.\n\nWhat concerns me most about this biography is its attempt to portray Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, wise, and gentle. However, historical accounts often challenge the notion of Muhammad as gentle and humble, leading me to question whether Muslims today are aware of the full history behind Muhammad's ascent to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were quickly left behind as Christian thought evolved after his lifetime. If we examine this history on a broad scale, we notice a tendency for Christianity to drift further from its roots. In today's world, there is a growing awareness and an unprecedented push towards progressiveness. While there are still traditionalists who resist new ways of thinking beyond what they've been taught, this group may not have enough influence to sway the majority. Within the Christian community, there will be a significant increase in historical awareness in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to separate the doctrines added over time from the original intent of Christianity's namesake. Although this may take decades or even centuries, the result is inevitable: a significant shift back to the original form of Christianity. A movement will emerge to peel back layers of doctrine, as if time is being reversed, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced on behalf of God remains, untouched by subsequent claims. As this movement spreads across the United States and Europe, inspiring people to worship as if in Jesus' time, adhering strictly to his teachings, the church will remain strong to guide this transformation. However, as theological perspectives regress, the diversity within Christianity will diminish into greater uniformity in belief and practice. Across regions, denominations, and all divisions, there will be a trend towards similarity rather than difference. History is marked by significant reversals. One example is the early persecution of Christians by the Roman Empire, which later became a Christian stronghold. Our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversal will take place within Christianity, seeking to undo history and diversity in pursuit of its origins. An essential part of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? By looking far back into history, we find the beginnings of Christianity in Judaism, which laid the foundation with monotheism, the notion of a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures, all established by the time Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish community was not united, as it was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a broad spectrum of common people.",
            "In my view, \"The Jungle\" illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest that lie within human nature. People tend to prioritize their own well-being and prosperity, often neglecting those who are less fortunate. This theme is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the behavior of the factory owners and managers. Their primary focus is on expanding and enhancing their businesses, disregarding the impact on others or the harm their progress may cause. Upton Sinclair's depiction of the industrial landscape underscores this disregard: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair illustrates the environmental destruction resulting from pollution and the lack of concern for both people and animals affected by it. The factory owners show no remorse for the smoke and waste produced by their operations.\n\nFurthermore, the owners and managers exhibit little concern for their employees, who toil to generate their wealth. They pursue profit at all costs, sacrificing loyalty and decency: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers endure long hours and face abrupt layoffs without compensation or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in \"The Jungle,\" few, if any, laws existed to protect workers' safety or welfare, allowing management to exploit their labor under harsh conditions. Although not explicitly stated, those who toiled and perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the dire circumstances both in and out of the workplace. No organizations existed to support or inform workers, and while unions emerged, they often exacerbated the plight of the laborers by profiting from their struggles. The workers were so oppressed and trapped within the Packingtown system that they were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his finer poetic creations. Within this poem, Poe makes use of the term \"Thulé,\" a reference found in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott links to Virgil. Virgil employed this term to describe an island located to the north of Britain, regarded by the Greeks as the boundary of the known world. While Virgil's use of the term is well-documented, it's important to note that there is a more contemporary influence on Poe's work. Poe showed a keen interest in German authors.\n\nThis particular reference underscores Poe's awareness of Goethe's literary contributions. In his book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt highlights the parallels between their two poems, suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe. According to the Oxford Companion to English Literature, Goethe was an esteemed writer, known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—first in 1808 and later in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a brief poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem recounts the story of a king whose wife passes away, leaving him a goblet as a gift. Grief-stricken, the king becomes consumed by heavy drinking and sorrow. In his final moments, he bequeaths his possessions to his children, except for the goblet. He then approaches a cliff, hurls the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and meets his own end. The demeanor of the King of Thulé closely resembles that of the figure in \"Dream-Land,\" perhaps reflecting Poe's own struggles with loss and alcohol. Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, shortly before Poe's inclusion of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe refers to Thule on two occasions in his body of work. He mentions \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but uses the term twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem. Viewed collectively, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as complementary pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the narrator describes Thule's landscape as dark and solitary, haunted by the specters of deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with the themes in Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" where the king mourns his wife, feels isolated, and loses his desire to rule or live. The poem's atmosphere suggests that the narrator has entered Goethe's literary world.\n\nGoethe was a prominent figure in literature, and Poe would have been familiar with his work, partly due to his admiration for Tennyson. Poe once remarked on his respect for Tennyson. Beyond this connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe's writings through the numerous reproductions that emerged following the initial publication.",
            "Under the legal framework of California, could a shopper who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket potentially receive punitive damages by arguing that the store manager acted with malice, having been informed twice about the spill but not addressing it for thirty minutes because he was having his dinner? It seems unlikely that a judge would immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To argue for such an award, a plaintiff must present evidence showing that the defendant's actions were taken with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm their conduct could cause, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could assert that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm from not cleaning up the spill, given that other customers had suffered injuries from slipping in the months leading up to Palmer's accident at D&D. Despite this awareness, Martin neglected to ensure the spill was cleaned up. Palmer's claim that Martin’s actions were despicable might be less convincing, yet it remains reasonable considering that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still didn't take proper steps to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 p.m., Rich Wayne, an employee at D&D Markets, informed his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin, however, responded that he was on his dinner break and couldn't attend to customer complaints. At 5:15 p.m., another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also reported the spill to Martin, receiving the same response. At 5:30 p.m., the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. In the year 2009, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D. Now, Palmer is pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the consideration is on whether to submit a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damages claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice,\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute specifies malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or if not intentional, must be \"despicable\" and done with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have deemed conduct as malicious when done with a conscious disregard for a plaintiff's rights, where the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences,\" as seen in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "For as long as she could remember, there was a persistent feeling of yearning within her, an unfulfilled desire that had taken root around the age of 14, as she stepped into her teenage years. Even three years later, at 17, this feeling lingered. She had concluded that her longing was for a person, not an object. Yet, no boys had captured her interest. Some had shown attraction towards her, trying awkwardly to win over her seemingly unyielding heart, but none sparked her interest. She often pondered this puzzling situation, wondering what could lead a teenage girl to feel this way. Despite years of introspection, she had developed theories but nothing substantial enough to consider seriously. So, she continued her life, constantly questioning her desires.\n\nTypically, days spent at home were serene. Her parents were gentle and composed, rarely engaging in disagreements with each other, and seldom with her. The only disputes arose from her asserting her independence and spirited nature. Though born to a calm couple, she balanced their tranquility with her vibrant personality, which, combined with her kindness, made her quite likable.\n\nHowever, today was an exception to the usual calm. As she moved from one room to another, seeking fresh inspiration, a sudden scream from the kitchen interrupted the tranquility. It was her mother's familiar voice. Startled, she dashed into the kitchen, anxiety building as she called out, \"Mom?! Mom, are you okay?!\" There, she found her mother on the floor, wincing and repeatedly uttering \"Ow\" with labored breaths. Rushing to her side, she placed a reassuring hand on her mother, who managed to say, \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The words were forced and breathy, and her daughter could tell her mother was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where you need support.\" Her mother indicated, and at that moment, the daughter felt grateful for her strength training. She lifted her mother into the car, gently laid her in the backseat, and drove.\n\nThe hospital greeted them with the familiar blend of antiseptic and anxiety, yet she was too focused on aiding her mother to notice. She hurriedly brought her mother inside, calling for medical help. Concerned staff quickly gathered, placing her mother on a rolling bed and whisking her away for immediate attention, leaving the daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had taken a fall from a stepping stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf in their home.",
            "The objective of this research was to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" correlates with a decreased likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as mortality from stroke. The aMed diet is an altered form of the Med diet, emphasizing a greater intake of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (rather than saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have highlighted an inverse relationship between following a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Moreover, an intervention trial established that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in aiding weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, past research did not specifically address stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes and were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) intended to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of the nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year duration. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Instances of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified as such. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin consumption, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and more accurately reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could interfere with results) by taking into account age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nStronger adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (including both fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile faced a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The sign declares: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in the movie Juno, stands solitary at a street corner, gripping a cardboard sign with those unsettling words scrawled in Sharpie. Burma, which is also referred to as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country saw its first significant public demonstrations in a decade. These were spearheaded by numerous Burmese monks and came to be known as the “Saffron Revolution,” named after the saffron-colored robes the monks wore. Initially, the government reluctantly permitted the peaceful protests, but as the public's involvement grew, tensions intensified. The situation escalated into what many viewed as a conflict between the monks and the military, with the junta raiding monasteries across the nation. Foreign journalists were detained, and Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, merely for attending a protest. While official reports claim 13 fatalities, Colonel Hla Win, an army defector, suggested that the actual number of deaths was much higher, potentially in the thousands.\n\nThese acts of brutality are not unprecedented. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress opposition to maintain control. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their absolute authority. Similarly, Japanese emperors were seen as deities destined to guide their people. In the contemporary era, President George W. Bush reportedly held regular discussions with Ted Haggard, the leader of an organization named Stupid People Worldwide, affiliated with the Republican Party.\n\nHistorical cases of such repression include the June 4, 1989, protests at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, workers, and students rallied against government authoritarianism. The death toll from this event varies, with Chinese government estimates at 200-300 deaths, while the Chinese Red Cross reported between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. Another grim example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, during which Hutu militias, supported by the Rwandan government, executed a systematic massacre targeting Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. The atrocities committed under Hitler’s ‘Third Reich,’ during which Jews were systematically exterminated across several countries, represent another extreme case of such oppression.",
            "Duke Ellington's remarkable impact on jazz is largely attributed to his enduring career and his innovative skill in orchestrating his band. While Ellington's piano presence is understated in many of the pieces chosen for this analysis, his prowess as a composer shines through his ability to craft intricate and layered compositions that highlighted his band members' talents. He constructed a musical environment where soloists could improvise freely while also composing tightly orchestrated segments that leveraged each musician's unique style to bring out musical concepts. Through this approach, he accentuated the orchestra's overall tone, creating unified and original melodies tailored to each piece. His exceptional understanding of individual musicians' sounds, combined with their collective harmony in an expanding ensemble, allowed him to produce some of jazz's most imaginative and outstanding works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when exploring Ellington's distinctive sound and inventiveness, points to Creole Love Call as an example of his use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early piece illustrates Ellington's use of voice to add texture and color independent of lyrics. Creole Love Call also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing his soloists' styles, a characteristic evident throughout his career. This deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds through six choruses, as follows:\n\nChorus 1: Features a call and response between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a coarser tone by the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo expands on the main melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A high-register clarinet solo is supported by a discreet syncopated piano line.\nChorus 4: The entire band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece reaches its climax as the reeds initiate the call and response in a higher register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Revisits the first chorus's structure, with call and response between voice and reeds. Here, the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, performing as an instrument.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant, novel trombone ending.\n\nEllington's integration of voice to enhance the tonal diversity of the piece exemplifies a stylistic characteristic that permeates his body of work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington blends his tight orchestration skills with his sensitivity to tone color. The piece features a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing, intertwining Miley’s vocal-like trumpet playing with Cox’s instrumental vocal style to create a complex and harmonious sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further explores these ideas, with Ellington using Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a stalwart of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone to great effect.",
            "What causes organisms to evolve in the ways they do? Are there particular limitations or factors that guide evolutionary changes? Even back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" a statement that holds true today. In recent years, mathematical modeling has been increasingly applied to various aspects of mollusk shell formation throughout both individual development and evolutionary history (such as in the work of Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of developmental and evolutionary changes in the Prunum species, combined with experimental studies, can help clarify the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental changes. By using X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that could model both hypothetical and actual shell shapes. These parameters were input into the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We then created models of hypothetical shell forms to explore the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of large-scale evolutionary events in this group.\n\nThink of a shell as a tube moving through 360 degrees of space over time. The turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, the columella, runs through the shell's central column. Whorls can expand at different speeds, and they are separated by a line called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one, also known as the body whorl. The spire includes all the whorls except for the last one. The spire’s tip is the apex, and the opposite end is called the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening termed the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The \"usual\" way to view a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.)\n\nTo count whorls, one starts by looking at the shell from the apical view and identifying where the first suture begins. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two parts. Whorls are counted from this line and approximated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of openings that move through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates for the center of each whorl’s aperture along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis path can be represented in both graphical and mathematical forms. Once a mathematical model is constructed, it's possible to adjust the parameters and alter the mollusk’s shell-forming process.",
            "In Indonesia, the rates of neonatal and infant mortality have not seen significant changes over the past decade. The country is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation. However, the necessary advancements in child and maternal health are not being achieved at the pace required to meet the targets set for 2015. The reasons for these deficiencies will be elaborated on, highlighting the importance of enhancing the overall health system instead of focusing solely on specific program interventions.\n\nThere have been advancements in ensuring skilled health workers are present at births, with 72% of deliveries now attended by such professionals. However, this figure also includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who are not equipped to handle medical complications during childbirth, contributing to the high number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Therefore, while progress in this area is reflected in the statistics, it presents a somewhat deceptive picture, indicating that substantial efforts are still needed. Moreover, there is a reduction in the proportion of children under five with diarrhea receiving treatment from healthcare professionals. Although comprehensive data on postnatal care is lacking, it is evident that this remains a significant concern nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates are lower than expected, approximately 4%. This statistic also highlights another issue: the disparity in healthcare access between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, the cesarean section rate is 7%, compared to just 2% in rural regions, underscoring the uneven distribution of healthcare services. Additionally, there is a noticeable gap in healthcare service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest segments of the population, with a 27% difference, indicating that the poor face greater barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to the financial burden involved.\n\nWhen considering the next steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question is how to effectively address the shortfall in service provision. Should Indonesia implement specific program strategies or focus on strengthening the health system as a whole without centering on maternal and child healthcare before and after pregnancy? Program-specific strategies are appealing as they offer targeted and manageable objectives, often yielding quicker results. However, there are potential drawbacks. A significant concern is that concentrating resources on one area can divert funding from other sectors, leading to an imbalance in resource allocation (as seen with the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on family planning services). Moreover, running several parallel programs can lead to service duplication and a lack of coordination, increasing the administrative burden for supplies and fund management.",
            "Over the past century, the landscape of Popular Music has expanded to encompass countless genres, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and even further subdivisions. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably evolved into one of the most varied and expressive categories of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a broad spectrum of emotions, albeit often leaning toward the more somber end. In terms of diversity, soon after its inception, the genre's inherent flexibility was recognized, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal scene has reached a level of diversity where pinpointing a precise definition of what constitutes heavy metal is challenging. It has absorbed numerous elements from other genres, yet like all things, it originated from a specific point. To fully appreciate the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends being just a genre.\n\nIn various respects, metal is a movement characterized by its dark themes. It can be described as \"music of more\"—more bass, volume, intensity, and theatricality. It moves away from primitiveness, showcasing skilled musicianship; members of metal bands are adept with their instruments, and this expertise is evident in their music. Unsurprisingly, metal is also a movement with significant drug influences. The psychedelic drug surge of the mid-1970s led to increasingly experimental music, with artists using substances as a catalyst for creating groundbreaking and otherworldly records. Metal's dark and visceral qualities stood out in the music scene, contrasting with the predominantly lighter themes in popular music. Later metal generations drew inspiration from the dark and intense elements that were prominent during the Romantic Era. Lyrics reflecting this darkness are emblematic of the movement, such as those by Byrne.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles showcase their darker side, depicting a tumultuous experience often associated with drug use. This track is sometimes cited as one of the earliest Heavy Metal songs, crafted in response to a Rolling Stones track that also explored heavier, darker themes. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate that they could match the intensity of the Stones, leading to the inclusion of this song on The White Album.",
            "Long before the Surrealist movement captured imaginations with its dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau was already weaving his own visions, both in reality and in his imagination. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only portrays a woman marveling at the wonders of an unfamiliar dreamscape but also symbolizes Rousseau’s personal aspirations and ambitions as an artist. From the beginning of his journey, Rousseau longed for recognition and acclaim from the art world he cherished, yet he grappled with an internal struggle to achieve this dream. The Dream encapsulates his enduring conflict: should he adhere to established artistic norms to gain acceptance, or should he forge his own path with a distinct and independent style?\n\nUnderstanding The Dream requires a glimpse into Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau hailed from a modest background; his father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who experienced some degree of prosperity (Shattuck 47). Without formal artistic training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, or toll service employee, until he was forty, though he was inaccurately referred to as a customs inspector, or douanier (Shattuck 46). The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, after the deaths of eight infant children, left him with one surviving daughter, Julia, and profound sorrow (Shattuck 49). Seeking solace and a new beginning, he turned to painting. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized rural life, Rousseau remained true to his roots, embodying the hopes and dreams of an ordinary person of his social class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance in the art community is understandable given his circumstances: he lacked formal education in painting, started his career later in life, and was overshadowed by more prominent artists of his time. Despite years of effort, it wasn’t until the emergence of artists like Matisse that Rousseau began gaining recognition. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that although Rousseau and Matisse were technically rivals, their motivations and methods were distinct. While Matisse feared falling into cliché, Rousseau aspired to create works so traditional that he would be welcomed by the Artiste Français (Gordon 92).",
            "Numerous philosophers have explored the close relationship between ethics and aesthetics, as well as truth and beauty. I am convinced there is a fundamental reason for this connection. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding is gained through education or experience, yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics more intuitively, without conventional instruction. Ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than dictate. Our discussions on morality and beauty primarily focus on explaining why a piece of art or a deed is admirable, rather than setting guidelines for assessing or producing good art or moral conduct.\n\nFurthermore, critiques of art or morality often fall short of truly encapsulating what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might involve aspects like foreground, background, contrast, or its cultural significance, but ultimately, these elements do not fully account for its artistic merit. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" before offering a more detailed analysis. I contend that the essence of art and morality cannot be entirely captured by describing their attributes. Flannery O'Connor once remarked, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we analyze a literary work, there remains an indescribable quality. I believe ethics shares this trait. Wittgenstein observed, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" It is this indescribable \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that is the most potent feature of art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI propose that the profound connection between morality and art stems from how we experience both on a noumenal level, to borrow a term from Kant. They affect us in ways that are felt deeply yet are hard to completely articulate. This link is particularly strong in the realm of literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a formidable nation, characterized by a rich tapestry of culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the Baltic coast in Kiel. This cultural essence is similarly present from Cologne along the Rhine, through Germany’s heartland, reaching the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It is only natural that contemporary Germany's identity is rooted in a variety of different origins and tribes.\n\nThe land known as Germania is the ancestral home of the German people. The etymology of its name is a subject of debate among scholars and historians. According to Tacitus, the term originated from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine to confront the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the term “Germanus” in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he recounted subduing the Gauls and engaging with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine under questionable pretenses. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to differentiate between those he had conquered (the Gauls) and those he had not. Although the origin remains uncertain, some suggest it referred to a neighboring tribe in the Gaulish language. In the opening chapter of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar remarks: “The Germans, who live beyond the Rhine, with whom the Gauls are in perpetual conflict... They engage with the Germans in almost daily skirmishes.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Some propose that the name derives from the spear, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or possibly from the Old Irish word garim, meaning “to shout,” indicating the Germans' loud demeanor (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his AD 98 work “De Origine et situ Germanorum,” the early Roman historian Tacitus described the origins of the Germans, stating, “I would consider [the Germans] as native and unmixed with other races through either migration or intermarriage. In earlier times, it was by sea, not by land, that immigrants arrived... Who would leave Asia or Africa, or even Italy, for Germany, with its harsh landscapes, severe climate, and grim customs, unless it was truly their home?” (Tacitus, 98)\n\nWhy would anyone abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They ventured into Germanic lands for resources and conducted occasional military campaigns, but ultimately, they returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the mid-first century, they settled along the Roman Empire’s borders, trading their land-derived goods and offering their expertise by serving in the Roman military (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the use of disguise can be quite effective for maintaining deception over time. However, ultimately, one must abandon this false identity to avoid losing their true self. The challenge in ending a deception is the potential alienation it may cause. Thus, a person must choose between preserving their own identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may react neutrally to the realization of being deceived, others may not be as forgiving and could take offense at the deception.\n\nThe theme of deception, particularly in the context of reversing gender roles, introduces additional complexities. A critical question arises: why does someone feel compelled to abandon their identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? Viola’s situation provides an example of self-preservation: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Upon arriving in an unfamiliar land, Viola feels the need to disguise herself as a man for protection against potential threats. Although her strategy succeeds, it isolates her from the women around her, severing a crucial support network. Compounding the situation, her male disguise is so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her, saying, “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own romantic feelings towards Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nWhile this might appear progressive to contemporary readers, Twelfth Night can be viewed as a narrative where deception unveils hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest that the presence of Viola/Cesario compels these characters to confront unspoken desires. For example, is Olivia attracted to Cesario purely because of his male appearance, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It can be argued that this is unlikely, as Shakespeare’s portrayal of Olivia seems to satirize individuals of his era who judge others based solely on appearance. This is demonstrated by how easily Olivia shifts her romantic interest from Cesario to Sebastian and starts considering Cesario/Viola as family instead of a romantic partner: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The German colonial regime has been characterized by various commentators for its harshness, particularly with regard to the atrocity against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, describing an entire colonial empire with such a broad brush is an oversimplification. The German colonial empire encompassed a range of policies and governance styles, much like its geographic diversity. Educational opportunities within the colonies mirrored this variability. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a significant number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education were recognized in Kamerun and other colonies by contemporary scholars. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) stood in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government established state schools and actively participated in the education of the local population, South West Africa largely delegated native education to missionary groups, which received minimal government backing. However, the government did allocate considerable resources to the education of Europeans in the colony, setting up a system of state schools alongside more substantial support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting implications for South West Africa, persisting beyond German rule. While other German colonies featured notable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to the different experiences in South West Africa. This paper aims to broaden the dialogue by identifying these factors and focusing on recent research about the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities toward native Africans. There exists an extensive body of literature specifically about education in the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The primary objective of early works was to outline the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies. Later English-language writings expanded the discussion through comparative studies of education in various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant disparities in the educational systems of different colonies. The most notable work that directly addresses the topic of this paper is Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational frameworks of the two colonies and examines the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of the colony's educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonial holdings, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, even though much of the region is arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored its relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an example of two nations that experienced a lengthy rivalry, which lasted 57 years from 1836 to 1893, as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). This tense relationship reached its peak during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, when the United States launched an offensive against Mexico, emerging victorious and acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. Numerous other confrontations occurred between the two countries, eventually subsiding just before the outbreak of World War I. The origins of this rivalry can be traced back to disagreements over crucial issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, as well as significant material interests, as highlighted by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario is not dissimilar to many other nations worldwide that have ongoing rivalries with neighboring countries. Border-sharing nations frequently encounter conflicting interests, leading to the establishment of adversarial positions. The United States and Mexico exemplify such enduring rivalries between bordering countries. David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations are geographically proximate to the United States and have historically been its rivals, whereas other Latin American countries have typically maintained amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences were a significant source of friction between the two nations, a common historical issue among many countries. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that \"while in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were against Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Much like the Cold War's ideological and interest-based rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, this earlier conflict was rooted not in political systems but in the religious preferences of the two countries. This mutual suspicion stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, a sentiment inherited from their colonial pasts, which posed a considerable challenge in fostering friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry period between Mexico and the United States. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws targeting American border towns were a persistent problem until both countries strengthened their military presence at the borders, as Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes.\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry between the nations began to diminish when \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and eventually concluded as American interests transitioned \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p. 110) towards the end of the 19th century.",
            "About fifteen years back, an unexpected illness left me suddenly disabled, something I had never imagined. At the time, I was working as a nurse. My career choice was driven by a deep-seated desire for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. Growing up, I often heard the saying, \"People will always need healthcare, so you'll always have a job.\" Although my true aspirations leaned toward becoming a scientist or a journalist, or perhaps both, I decided to pursue nursing.\n\nFast forward to being 46 years old, I found myself single, with no significant savings, and unable to continue working. Today, I remain disabled, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing to call my own. I manage to get by, but each day brings challenges that threaten my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Despite the uncertainty that now characterizes my life, one truth remains: I couldn't have endured these years without the support of my family and a few close friends, no matter how resilient I believed myself to be. In the face of true calamity, feeling strong is rare.\n\nEmergencies, both large and small, are inevitable in life. No matter how prepared we are, some situations are simply too overwhelming to tackle alone. I agree that in the U.S., we need to diversify our reliance beyond big government, which is undeniably crumbling. However, I would prefer to see Americans rebuild trust in each other, fostering a culture of mutual aid rather than isolation.\n\nWhile some US Conservatives praise \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our nation, it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and resource-sharing that sustained our ancestors through tough times. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in wagon trains reached the coast not by going it alone, but through collective effort.\n\nTherefore, it's wise to be prepared. I am. I have assembled a disaster kit, complete with first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows in case of a biological threat. My preparations also include flashlights, various batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned food. If you have the means to cultivate a small farm or preserve your own food, it's advisable. A wood stove is also beneficial, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you make these preparations, remember to connect with your neighbors.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born who would eventually become known as the Buddha. Throughout his lifetime, he chose to leave worldly life behind and attained enlightenment, resulting in the creation of Buddhism. The oldest and most traditional branch of this faith is Theravada Buddhism. This religious tradition has been around for about 2,500 years and has evolved significantly since the time of the Buddha. Such changes are evident in places like Sri Lanka, a Theravada Buddhist country, where people observe the annual water-cutting ceremony. Both monks and laypeople take part in this event, which holds religious meaning even though the Buddha did not teach any such celebration. These variations are not only visible in surface-level practices but also penetrate the core teachings of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members, has had to adapt its doctrinal beliefs over time due to various influences, both internal and external, whether they be adversarial or neutral.\n\nIn this discussion, several key terms will be frequently used. The first is the distinction between internal and external forces. Internal forces arise from within the Buddhist community, known as the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status, while external forces come from outside the Buddhist community. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm Buddhism, often stemming from negative perceptions of it. Benign forces, on the other hand, neither seek to harm nor aid Buddhism, although they may inadvertently do so. These terms will be discussed repeatedly throughout this exploration.\n\nTo begin, it is essential to examine the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the three jewels: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the teachings, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the discipline, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the philosophical aspects of Buddhism. These philosophical concepts include Anatta, the absence of a permanent self; Dukkha, the inherent suffering in life; and Anicca, the impermanence of all things. Understanding these ideas is crucial to ending Samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth. Achieving enlightenment also puts an end to lobha (greed), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: refraining from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and taking intoxicants. Monks follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the core of Buddhism are the four noble truths. The first truth is Dukkha, the acknowledgment that life involves suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome."
