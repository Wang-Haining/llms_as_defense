            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation, the influence of culture is profound. Culture is often understood by what it isn't, as much as by what it is and what it represents. It doesn't conform to a single mold, nor can it be pinned down to a specific entity. It's neither singular nor uniform. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently general and overly reductive. While grasping cultural generalizations can be useful, it is far more beneficial for a negotiator to comprehend the relevance of culture to the issue at hand and how that culture's perspective might influence the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, one interprets it relative to their own, naturally drawing comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding another culture or mindset can involve a range of activities, from exploring its historical context to recognizing its biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one should embrace it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, and especially when in a less advantageous bargaining position. Similarly, if negotiating on foreign ground, showing respect for local customs and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance discussions.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to national or international distinctions. Many businesses within a nation cultivate their own unique corporate culture. For example, some corporate cultures may prioritize extended office hours, while others may adopt a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in dress codes, communication styles (whether direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some organizations promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others limit it to specific \"company-approved\" initiatives. Examining the variations in American corporate culture across different companies (and even within regions or between urban and suburban settings) highlights the diversity of perspectives within a societal culture. While some cultures may appear less stratified than American culture and seem more uniform to outsiders, this similarity is merely an invitation to delve deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more critical, as they reveal the reasoning behind a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success in negotiations. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining will not necessarily rush to settle. Considering these generalities is crucial before entering negotiations. However, it is advantageous for a negotiator to personally understand their counterpart to make the negotiation truly effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This perspective seems to be shared by Thomas Aquinas, the other thinker we are examining. Since both philosophers argue for the existence of the same deity, our task is to assess which argument is more compelling. For the sake of efficiency, we will assume they both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. If we were to consider a different kind of deity, it would not allow for a fair comparison of their arguments, as both focus on defending a particular understanding of God. With that in mind, I propose that while both philosophers offer important insights, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo clarify this point, let's first explore St. Anselm's fundamental argument. His approach involves attaining knowledge through faith, encouraging individuals to seek evidence of God within themselves. Anselm argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot genuinely imagine His absence. Although his terminology can be intricate and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the proof of God's existence is found within our minds. Anselm implies that we need not look beyond our inner selves to discover the truth about God, as His existence is validated by examining our inherent understanding. This acceptance of concepts without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian doctrine.\n\nThis notion contrasts sharply with that of St. Thomas Aquinas, who believes that God's existence can be entirely demonstrated through logic and empirical evidence, negating the necessity of faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, a critical aspect of Christianity, as it allows for persuading potential converts through reason alone, independent of their readiness to accept unprovable beliefs. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially argues that God's existence is a logical necessity. For instance, if informed that a puzzle piece is missing, one can deduce the existence and features of that piece through logic, even without seeing it.",
            "Authors often employ a range of strategies to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous such techniques. At times, Fitzgerald combines an unexpected adjective with a noun to create a distinctive atmosphere surrounding a subject. Alternatively, he may assign symbolic meaning to an object for the same purpose. One prominent method he employs involves the use of color symbolism, particularly with hues like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, with particular significance, subsequently using these associations to evoke certain feelings in readers about key elements.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the symbolism of white/gray as representing uniformity, with white suggesting a touch of elegance and class, while gray denotes something more aged and faded. This symbolism is introduced early on through repeated mentions of these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as being \"in white\" (8), and white attire is a common theme: Nick sports \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only notable deviation occurs when Nick describes Gatsby's party, noting that \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further clarifies the significance of these colors by applying them to mundane subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the guest list at Gatsby's parties features \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a metaphor for uniformity (28). Ordinary people and places are often depicted in shades of white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has firmly established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to denote insignificance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period with minimal mention of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more of a uniform symbol, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues to apply this technique around Daisy to reinforce the impression of her as a uniform element, as seen in references to the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress preceding the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",

Several organic farms offer tours of their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. These operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs, enhance habitats, and create avenues for farm tours and educational initiatives.  \nOrganic farming can tap into a profitable niche market while also enhancing biodiversity in local plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemical usage in the soil and water. Nonetheless, organic agriculture can be more costly compared to conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to eliminate pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses than conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms lack the economies of scale that larger operations enjoy. Activities unrelated to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and managing plant growth to create habitats, can also increase labor costs. This is why a landowner in this case might look for financial assistance or expertise to maximize profitability while maintaining high habitat quality.  \nThe land selected for this example is located near Potrero, in the unincorporated part of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres and includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, which is under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \nThis region was historically inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 1800s. This parcel of land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the decades.  \nI selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore what realistic options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. To model what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful, indelible tie. This relationship encompasses various emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers share a unique understanding, deeper than any other bond, often seeing their own reflection in each other. The true essence of this bond reveals itself in moments of adversity, whether it manifests in a positive or negative light. These emotions, when laid bare, come with significant repercussions. Grasping the feelings that arise from this brotherly connection also involves reckoning with their resulting outcomes. When one brother meets the gaze of another and perceives his own image, he sees not the person others do, but his authentic self. It is in their behaviors and the outcomes of those behaviors that their genuine character is revealed. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers and the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a richly detailed environment, these boys embark on a journey destined for failure. Intense pride clashes with bitter disappointment in a dramatic climax, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is depicted through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview that greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are motivated by one dominant emotion: pride. From his first outing with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother he could teach skills like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He desired a companion for races to Horsehead Landing or to sit with at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, these aspirations were unattainable due to Doodle's fragile heart condition, which made survival uncertain and vigorous activity nearly impossible. For the young protagonist, whose mind was filled with grand dreams, this reality was devastating. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle at times, recalling a moment when he considered smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would entertain thoughts of such a drastic action? Yet, his resolve falters when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that instills hope in the protagonist, suggesting his commitment was never truly strong. An innate love for his brother lingered in his heart.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and innovative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from its rudimentary stages to the contemporary era, the metaphors describing the brain have similarly progressed. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, and a book, it is now often compared to a computer. However, when studying the brain, it is important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe process of handling information begins with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory data is continuously transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white backdrop, bottom-up processing assembles basic details such as color, orientation, and the object's boundaries—where the color noticeably shifts over a brief distance—to conclude that a box is being observed. Top-down processing utilizes decisions from earlier stages of bottom-up processing to hasten the recognition of the box, aiding in identifying it as a black box instead of a hole in the white background.\n\nAs information undergoes processing, an attention filter determines the significance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be directed towards. While the brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures they aren't individually noticeable. Conversely, you might distinctly hear your name in a noisy room. Processing occurs in numerous stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. Memory exists in several forms, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with each type of sensory stimulus having specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal inputs can be encoded based on their appearance, sound, or meaning. After storage, information needs to be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be sustained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some drawing from human memory retrieval patterns, others from computer science, and still others from neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, connected based on their relationships. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might link to “table,” which could connect to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Back in 2007, the U.S. found itself grappling with a severe financial crisis that had far-reaching impacts. There were significant spikes in unemployment rates, the housing market collapsed, and many of the nation's major corporations faced devastation. The recession lingers on, prompting us to question the origins of this crisis and consider potential solutions. At its core, the financial turmoil was a result of imprudent political choices that encouraged financial institutions to issue risky sub-prime loans within an underdeveloped economic framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to support and transform these loans into complex financial products. As borrowers began to default, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the repercussions spread through the economy.\n\nThe origins of the crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to bolster his chances for reelection. The strategy involved loosening lending regulations to gain favor among the populace, inadvertently laying the groundwork for the sub-prime mortgage disaster that would unfold seven years later. A 1999 report by Steven Holmes in the New York Times highlighted the pressures faced by Fannie Mae to increase lending to lower-income groups, driven by both the administration's push and shareholder expectations for profit growth. Holmes presciently warned of potential issues during economic downturns, suggesting a possible government bailout reminiscent of the 1980s savings and loan crisis.\n\nSeveral elements contributed to the economic downturn, not least of which were the complex mortgage structures that became prevalent. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations entangled various economic sectors with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and heightened vulnerability to price fluctuations. When the housing bubble finally burst, financial entities holding these securities suffered significant losses. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing nearly a third of the country's GDP. This led to the sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch at significantly reduced prices, the disbandment of Lehman Brothers, and the transformation of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government oversight by September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—a section of your narrative where you spread your creative wings and soar, captivating everyone with your enchanting, if not mesmerizing, prose. Alternatively, it might be where your audience dozes off or clicks away, lamenting your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to express frustration at her screen when overwhelmed by an excess of information, and not in a delightful manner.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are familiar with the writing adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself entangled in lengthy passages where nothing unfolds, or worse, too much does. Exposition is that mischievous spirit whispering in your ear to clear the historical clutter before getting to the exciting parts (not to be mistaken with the other spirit urging you to share every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition entails narrating events to the audience, often using straightforward language. In cinema, exposition occurs when a character reveals a bulk of information to another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it is the author who does the narrating.\n\nAn illustration is warranted. As you explore a story, you are informed that the heroine encountered her beloved at a specific place and time, they married in a grand ceremony, and her husband was tragically murdered before her eyes. You would not anticipate this entire sequence to span two pages, with both characters receiving only two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to invest time in developing the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior the depth of his love for his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to exhibit, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the narrative later states that this was indeed the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would foster emotional investment in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, insights into her thoughts, beliefs, and aspirations as mirrored in his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his loss alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance on the simple outline of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your duty to provide that substance. (*examines metaphor, sighs, ventures forward*) It can be tempting to gloss over certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, aware that he once served in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a \"live\" segment on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The leading story was about a man from Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; her name wasn't mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and he appeared quite sinister. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still unfolding. The details provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I felt they allocated a suitable amount of time to this news.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At that time, no arrests had been made, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the incident. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might be because it involved a \"black\" man or occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped, missing, or a victim of a crime, the media usually provides extensive coverage; however, if a minority is involved, it's rare for it to be mentioned.\n\nThe following story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about where they believed the incident took place. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers is offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next segment was about the forecasted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was brief, likely to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nAdditionally, there was a report about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. They mentioned he was about six feet tall and weighed around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they placed an unusual emphasis on his race and complexion.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a twenty-five-year prison sentence, they stated \"300\" months. I am unsure of their intention, whether it was to make it sound harsher or for another reason. They also noted he was Hispanic, which I felt was unnecessary information for the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund, commonly known as an ETF, is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, yet offers greater flexibility by being traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF combines the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase just a single share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, one downside is the necessity to pay commissions on ETF trades, akin to those on stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast array of available funds. Though these benefits are highlighted, it is wise for a prudent financial investor to assess whether benefits like diversification genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will scrutinize the ETF IHF and contrast it with its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and to explore if there are better configurations of these stocks for an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, it becomes impractical to include every holding; thus, we have chosen to focus only on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Here are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use the current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to compute each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The calculations for Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio with just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top ten holdings is also .12 lower than the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, there exists a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from one another.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In looking back at Figure 17, a significant decline in commuter log submissions was noticeable by the third month of the project, which was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter at a New England university might have contributed to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when individuals are occupied with wrapping up academic responsibilities and grading, potentially causing the commuter log to be overlooked. The busy holiday season and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty, who often do not need to be on campus during this period, could also be factors. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might explain the low log submissions for that time. However, February's low submissions remain puzzling. It might be that projects like these naturally experience an initial surge in enthusiasm that wanes over time. To address this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, maintaining project momentum was challenging, particularly due to the natural drop in engagement and the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another hurdle faced by this project, and similar initiatives, is that personal car use, with its associated freedom and flexibility, is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, such as gift certificates to local dining establishments, coffee shops, massage services, an independent bookstore, and some larger national retailers. However, it would have been intriguing to observe how larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric vehicle, might have influenced participation and potentially mitigated the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing their value over time might have been beneficial. Initially, the gift cards were well-received, but announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles in December or a hybrid or electric car in January, could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the early Edison films collection at the Library of Congress, I was intrigued by the category of trick films, so I decided to watch all fifteen produced between 1895 and 1901. These films are known for their use of inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis centered on detailing the aesthetics of most trick films and identifying unique features in some of the later examples. Typically, trick films from this era were studio-bound, shot within a frontal proscenium, featured static cameras, relied on long and medium shots, and followed a strict one shot per film method. However, a few films at the beginning of the 20th century started to challenge these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is their use of interior sets framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains static, not following any figures or objects. This approach, common in early cinema, has its origins in theatrical productions, as well as vaudeville and magic shows for trick films. One limitation of this stage-based setup is that actors in trick films typically move only side-to-side, avoiding movement toward or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains stationary.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also results in predominantly long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in Edison’s trick films because, much like in theater and vaudeville, the audience sees the entire performance within the stage's frame. Therefore, the actors do not approach the camera from the middle ground, eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nIn general, early trick films adhere to the format where one conceptual shot represents an entire film. This constraint keeps most trick films under a minute long, influenced by the frames per second used. It also limits the narrative or dramatic potential, as these films primarily focus on brief vaudeville-style acts like magic, vanishing, and transformations with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot to the audience doesn't always equate to a single physical shot. What appears as one shot may be a series of shots seamlessly combined to create illusions like appearing or disappearing. A closer look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) reveals the transition to the shot with Mary's \"head\" being severed, showcasing how, despite appearing as one continuous shot, multiple shots are used to achieve the trick.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is intriguingly a contradiction in terms, as Ian Watt elaborates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" The Gothic genre has experienced mixed opinions, having been both criticized for lacking depth and celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto is considered the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blending elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to forge the beginnings of the Gothic genre and introduce a novel form of literary expression. Walpole integrates \"old\" theatrical components with 'new' emulations of nature found in 'modern' novels, coining it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often revisits medieval gothic theater, architecture, and customs. At the time The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or lacking sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of the dramatic \"Gothic\" with the novel's format, which offers a deeper insight into characters' psyches, is what has enabled Gothic literature to endure over time, appearing both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its initial creation.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and altered in the first Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the ideal knight—courageous, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of those ideals in society, a sentiment shared by Walpole. By using chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized, hinting at the future shift from Gothic to Romantic, and is employed to critique and potentially enhance the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was navigating a politically tumultuous era and was concerned about what lay ahead. Engrossed in politics and facing potentially unjust accusations, he might have begun to believe, perhaps subconsciously, that the moral integrity and intrinsic \"goodness\" of the gothic era had somehow faded from contemporary society. This notion is evident in his portrayal of several characters, notably Frederic. Before even encountering Frederic, readers learn he embodies numerous chivalric qualities; he is described as:\n\nFrederic is depicted with many traditional chivalric attributes; he is primarily a prince who has endured suffering, been profoundly impacted by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, amplified, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic motif of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of steps that facilitate the transfer of goods from the initial customer order through various stages such as raw material sourcing, supply, production, and finally distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He defined it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing activities within the supply chain to efficiently meet customer demands. The supply chain comprises six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nProduction marks the beginning of the supply chain. It serves as the groundwork for the entire sequence, determining the logistics of when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must grasp customer preferences, often gauged by market trends, to ascertain the demand for specific products. Upon understanding market demands, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantity. Following this, they select the most suitable production facilities, balancing volume and quality to meet customer expectations. Once production sites are established, managers turn their attention to organizing workloads and maintaining equipment. This stage is crucial as it impacts the entire supply chain process; any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses. For instance, during my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, I observed that both companies had detailed guidelines for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes help businesses operate efficiently and avoid confusion regarding procedures and expectations.\n\nThe next major component of supply chain management is supply. This involves strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and the potential for outsourcing partnerships. A single product might be produced across various divisions, each with distinct equipment, staff, and expertise. It is up to management to determine which division is best suited for different stages of production. Additionally, outsourcing may be considered to enhance velocity, which refers to the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or stable.",
            "Victorian novels often stand out due to their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the period’s aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, diverge from these norms. Both books incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are uncommon for novels of that era, thereby enhancing the depth of their characters and offering greater insight into their motivations and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the narrative frequently delves into dreamlike sequences or surreal states that vary in purpose and content. These peculiar moments often reveal layers of Oliver's inner self, his suffering, and his understanding of the realities around him. In chapter 28, when Oliver's shooting incident is revisited, he experiences it as vividly as a dream, struggling to seek assistance. This passage highlights Oliver’s lack of control over the unfolding events and his precarious health condition, vividly portrayed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. As the shooting incident consumes him, his senses become numbed, and he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that rescues him; he re-experiences despair, with pain now an ever-present companion linked more to fear than surprise. This raises questions about who is responsible for Oliver's plight, as it is certainly not by his own choice. The episode emphasizes Oliver's limited control over his life, as he cannot muster the will to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at risk. The selection hints at Oliver’s growing sense of defeat, suggesting that Fagin's influence is breaking him, pushing him towards resignation and affecting his ability to respond, whereas otherwise, one might expect Oliver to make some effort for his own survival.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years back, I participated in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade, and was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. It became apparent to me that something was amiss; his issues were quite unusual. He could pronounce some letters flawlessly while others were completely elusive, which was puzzling. Adrian was of Latino heritage, which was evident, yet he spoke impeccable English. We continued to face challenges until I met his mother one day. While I was supervising a few students who stayed back when the rest went on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, not a word of English. Despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was during this interaction that I realized Adrian's issue: he could read well but was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this realization was beneficial for him in the long run, but I sincerely hope he has improved since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It serves as a testament to the fact that these barriers aren't always as apparent as one might assume. Even children who speak flawless English might encounter significant challenges in reading it. Acknowledging this problem is easy, but addressing it is another matter. In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There is no singular answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea. It benefits not only children whose first language is Spanish but all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs often surpass their peers academically. Concerns exist that such programs are resource-draining and won't benefit the majority. This is a misconception. Making these programs a standard part of the curriculum, rather than an exception, would benefit all students. But how should this be implemented? Should all teachers be required to be bilingual? No, that would be impractical and somewhat unrealistic. However, we can certainly employ bilingual aides or tutors to support these efforts.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some find this in Sunday school, others in Temple, or through personal introspection. Many accept the religions inherited from our parents, but some dismiss them, believing there's nothing beyond their own self-centered universe. We might embrace one belief system only to later replace it with another. Regardless of the path taken, we seek to understand a part of ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives, looking for a guiding light to lead us from darkness into clarity.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he said, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain drum against the tin roof as we smoked. Rainwater cascaded from the gutters, flooding the plants nearby. Dad gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed both reflective and reminiscent. He had lost weight over the past months, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser. He continued to avoid eye contact, and I felt isolated, scared, unable to express how much I'd miss him, fearing that speaking it out loud would make it more real for us both. I hugged him, then moved my chair closer, joining him in watching the rain fall in the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away that December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his pain, only prolonged his life beyond doctors' predictions; what was gained by extending his suffering, I couldn't understand. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I didn't pray. If God existed, I felt he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him transition from this life to whatever comes next. So, I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that gave me life come to an end. I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to witness his passing. I stayed curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for Republicanism in his time. While his primary occupation was in agriculture, his brief political career also shaped his reputation as a passionate and vocal defender of personal freedom and governance. His steadfast belief in an agriculture-based society influenced most of his thoughts on government affairs. He strived to protect and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions, which in turn impacted his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the formation of the United States as a unique chance to establish an exemplary system of governance, unburdened by entrenched traditions. This allowed for the creation of a self-governing framework. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, considering these rights interconnected—if one is denied, the others suffer, diminishing their worth. Thus, he argued that these rights should remain outside governmental control. He contended that what was often termed the “state of nature” favored those with physical strength and cunning, but insisted that in a civilized society, this should not be the norm.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges humanity's inherent virtues and vices. He held strong views on moral duality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). To him, good principles were those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. A government founded on such principles, he believed, would operate justly, even when led by self-interest and greed. He saw self-interest as a natural human motivation, only deemed negative when it led to societal structures exploiting others. A sound government, he believed, was essential for curbing humanity's natural malevolence and needed vigilant oversight to prevent the infusion of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a Federal government with highly limited powers, restricted to those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government could become costly and tyrannical. Nonetheless, he cautioned that a mere literal interpretation could be perilous without considering the framers' intentions, as such an approach might become corrupted. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, emphasizing its depiction of the nation as a coalition of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind struggling to fully grasp the scenery laid out before me. In a detached and quiet manner, I assessed the sight with an awareness that chose not to connect it to any abstract interpretation. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it barely felt like I was thinking at all; it was more like I was simply experiencing the scene in front of me. \n\nOnce, upon the suggestion of an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art guide titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Ever since I was a child of six, I had aspired to draw, and this book offered lessons on everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain perceives lines. One of its methods was to frame any picture the artist wished to study with a square. This technique transformed a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a more manageable image: just the bowl of fruit on a simple plane.\n\nIn that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist’s frame. I was overwhelmed, struck with awe, able only to stand and marvel. Picasso had a blue period, Monet cherished greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists used a spectrum of colors. If I had any ambition to view my perspective as deserving of the label Artistic, what lay before me was the inception of my creation, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creation, muscles flexing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, my mind’s intent taking shape in what could have been the most inventive moment of my life. Water swirled serenely, smooth and crystal clear. Fragments of matter detached from the whole and vanished. Muscles tensed, my hand struck the toilet handle again, more urgently. The stubborn brown parcel remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nWith a mop loosely held in my hand, feet planted a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly at the offensive bundle of processed matter left as a message for those tasked with cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some serene moments of introspection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….",
            "Young drivers are facing significant risks on the road. Various elements contribute to the alarming statistics regarding teenage drivers in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that adolescent brains are not fully developed to handle the challenges of driving. Additionally, lack of experience is a major factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to incidents like rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road.\n\nTeenagers are particularly vulnerable when driving with friends, a situation they frequently find themselves in. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center demonstrated a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented measures such as provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and the presence of other minors as passengers to enhance teen driver safety.\n\nHowever, I view provisional licenses as temporary fixes. The core problem is that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unprepared to manage driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even argues that 18 years old might still be too young for a standard driver’s license. His research, highlighted by USA Today, suggests that individuals under 19-20 are often driven by a desire for thrill-seeking. It would therefore be logical to delay licensing until this behavior starts to diminish. Continuing to allow young teenagers to drive could result in increasing numbers of fatal accidents, with a potentially overwhelming death toll as more Baby Boomer offspring reach driving age by 2010.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver’s education programs to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be permitted to drive. A provisional permit could still be granted before a full license, with a requirement for a certain number of practical training hours. This requirement could align with current standards in most states, such as California’s mandate of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across states, a uniform national policy on this matter would be a sensible and potentially effective way to safeguard teenagers nationwide.\n\nThe legislative approach I propose is not a groundbreaking concept.",
            "This essay explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise explanation of what the disorder entails. Following this, it delves into how CAPD is diagnosed, highlighting typical signs or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes by suggesting strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), CAPD is narrowly defined as the perceptual processing of auditory information within the CNS and the neurobiologic activities that underlie such processing, resulting in electrophysiologic auditory potentials. Essentially, this means that while individuals with CAPD can hear normally, the part of the brain tasked with interpreting sounds and distinguishing speech from background noise does not function as expected.\n\nThe origins of what is now known as CAPD trace back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers began assessing children with communicative disorders. In 1954, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing diagnostic tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) that is involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A pivotal national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD among children.\n\nCAPD can present itself in various forms. Individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially, differentiate between multiple sound occurrences, recognize sound patterns, or detect changes in speech, such as tone indicating sarcasm. They might experience difficulty when one sound overlaps with another, lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful interpretations, or have trouble perceiving the order of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of listening behaviors and auditory functions, carried out by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. This process may include the use of questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to auditory stimuli (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool or test with a high success rate, nor is there a known cause for CAPD. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously, requiring them to distinguish between specific elements, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments might involve measuring acoustic signals within the ear and observing the responses to these signals.",
            "My educational journey in social work is driven by a desire to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where my goal is to support children who have experienced abuse or neglect and to assist families in distress. I bring to the field values such as service, respect, ethics, and a dedication to fostering better relationships while continuously improving my professional abilities to stay effective in my work. These principles are not only fundamental to social work but are also deeply significant to me on a personal level.\n\nHelping others has always been my aspiration, though I initially struggled to identify the exact career path I wanted. During high school and college, I observed many people who avoided confronting their challenges, and some adopted poor coping strategies. These observations motivated me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain about my career direction after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took some time off. That summer, I happened to visit a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. He was there seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had involved the police at his parents' home. Wanting to help, I went over to his parents' house to express my concerns privately to the officers, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as legally they couldn't intervene for the teenager. When I spoke to the parents, they were uneasy and offered excuses for their son’s behavior, labeling his actions as “manipulative” for involving others in “simple” family matters. This incident propelled me to seriously contemplate a career in social work to aid children facing such “simple” familial conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of social work that holds significant importance for me. Society often emphasizes the value of the individual and mourns those we lose, yet the societal idea of the “individual” often follows outdated norms rather than true uniqueness. If society mourns individuals, why do we strive for uniformity? I cherish my individuality and resist conforming to others' standards. Throughout my time in high school and college, I consistently opposed social injustice through personal expression like unconventional hair and clothing, multiple ear piercings, active participation in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to the cause of social justice and will persist in challenging social inequities.",
            "This essay explores both the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks as they pertain to insomnia. The Biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical components of health. In contrast, the Sociocultural perspective examines environmental interactions and their relevance to factors like race, ethnicity, demographic information, and socioeconomic status. This analysis of insomnia evaluates these models and delves into selected research to elucidate and enhance understanding of these frameworks. The research explanations and their outcomes are then evaluated for their distinctive strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized in various ways: as primary sleep disorders, those associated with other mental disorders, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders tied to other mental disorders correlate with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional categories may stem from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia pertains to challenges in staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy includes symptoms like cataplexy and/or automatic REM. While Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological irregularities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This analysis centers on insomnia and somewhat on primary sleep disorders more broadly, in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders highlights genetic, hereditary, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research involving mice discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that facilitate sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to extend sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal studies with mice may be applicable to human studies. This indicates a genetic and environmental foundation for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could hinder one's ability to achieve restful sleep without medication. From a sociocultural viewpoint, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any modification of the receptor might naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This could adversely affect various life aspects such as education, career, and daily tasks requiring focus and repetition.",
            "For roughly two and a half years, encompassing about four and a half semesters, I've been studying at University Park. Navigating the campus poses a challenge for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls, practically the easternmost boundary of the campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Making my way from Stuart Hall to classes located in distant buildings like Willard, near the campus core, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when the weather was unfavorable, which is often the case in State College. A conversation with a slightly older alum revealed that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the main campus by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space is occupied by sports fields, massive new structures like the Creamery and the health services building, and is encircled by apartments. As the campus continues its growth, moving around becomes increasingly challenging. What could be the optimal solution for campus mobility? Bicycles are the answer. However, bikes alone won’t address the issue. Students need to ride them, and the infrastructure should accommodate cyclists’ needs.\n\nA friend of mine recently returned to cycling after several years and expressed surprise at why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he remarked, “for a while, biking wasn’t considered cool, but it’s the best way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, cycling is also the most efficient form of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many students, I now reside off-campus, just as distant from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike has been my smartest decision this year. I have classes in the Thomas building daily, which is a good 25-minute walk from my home. With a bike, that journey can be reduced to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only challenge is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my place, isn’t always an easy path, whether you're biking or walking. Walking has its merits, but I’m simply too busy for it. Without my bike, I’d have no other dependable way to reach my classes. Walking to Thomas every day would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, adding up to over two and a half hours weekly. Plus, the extra walking time to other classes and appointments would demand more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist system that underpins it, constructing a dystopian society to explore these themes. Within this society, individuals prioritize collective well-being over personal identity, being conditioned from birth to seek immediate pleasure as their ultimate goal. The citizens are mere instruments in a grand scheme, confined to a singular ideology orchestrated by the World Controller. Viewing the novel through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley’s skepticism towards these developing systems. Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification bolster the argument that Huxley's work critiques the flaws of the economic landscape emerging during his era.\n\nCapitalism is ridiculed through the Marxist idea of false consciousness, wherein ordinary people remain unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This stems from ideological control over the working class, vividly illustrated by the conditioning of the populace in \"Brave New World.\" The lower social classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy; through hypnopædia, they are driven to consume, spend, and indulge above all. This manipulation is overseen, as noted earlier, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the concept that certain social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, literally embracing an ideology that sustains the existing structure—capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes have the awareness to recognize it but largely remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, aside from characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes significantly illustrate the perceived oppression within capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are absent. The novel intentionally blurs character distinctions, even among main characters, who lack depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the intertwining rise of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent; instead, interactions are superficial, seen in the men’s comments about women focusing mainly on physical traits, like their \"pneumatic quality,\" and in the women’s candid remarks about their experiences. Moreover, the satisfaction of each social class with their position in the hierarchy reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering conformity to their roles in the community echoes Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where one of the central debates was whether Islam could be considered a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent now than it did back then. Reflecting on the period since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, moving from a hostile stance against Islam and its extremists to an increased tolerance within American society. In 2001, it would have been hard to imagine a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has a family background that includes Muslim ties.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me because, based on my understanding of his history, it seems to contradict his portrayed personality. Previously, I believed that Muhammad converted people to Islam by force, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography presents Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself, leading people to gradually recognize the 'truth' of his teachings and seek him out.\n\nInterestingly, there are notable similarities between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's 'miracles.' One striking example is when Muhammad reportedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of narration suggests the authors wanted to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and performing miracles without needing to prove himself. This narrative bothers me because it seems to diminish the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, almost as if credit is being taken from Jesus and attributed to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories aimed at providing evidence of individuals 'independently' converting to Islam. However, these accounts often appear to rely on third-party perspectives, with the narrative indicating someone heard it from someone else, and so on. While the intention might be to offer proof of these stories' authenticity, I find this approach makes the accounts seem less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the portrayal of Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge this depiction, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his lifetime quickly diverged from the path of Christian development that continued after his passing. Observing this historical progression, it becomes apparent that Christianity has gradually drifted from its origins. In today's world, there is an increasing awareness and a unique progressive trend. While some traditionalists persist and will resist any thought that extends beyond their teachings, this group may not have the influence to sway the majority. Within the Christian community, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to differentiate the doctrines that were incorporated into Christianity over time from the original intent of its founder. Though this process may take decades or even centuries, the eventual outcome seems inevitable: a significant shift back to Christianity’s original form. A growing movement will aim to peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, as if reversing the flow of time, until only the essence of what Jesus conveyed to humanity on behalf of God remains, untouched by subsequent interpretations. When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, inspiring many to worship as if they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will remain robust to guide this transition. However, as theological perspectives revert, the vast diversity within Christianity will diminish, leading to more uniform beliefs and practices. Across regions and denominations, and bridging various divisions, we will observe a shift from differences to growing similarities. Human history is replete with significant reversions. A noteworthy example is the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution. Similarly, our nation has evolved from a history of African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The impending reversion will unfold within the realm of the Christian religion, retracing history to its origins and reducing diversity along the way. It is vital to recognize that this process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? Looking back far enough, we find Judaism as the theological foundation for Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. However, the Jewish population was not uniform; it was divided among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common folk.",
            "In my view, The Jungle vividly illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest present in human nature. Individuals tend to prioritize their own welfare and strive to enhance their lives without considering those less fortunate. This theme is prominently depicted in several ways throughout the novel. A clear example is seen in the actions of the factory owners and managers, who are solely focused on expanding their businesses to the greatest extent possible. They show little concern for the obstacles or the harm they cause in their pursuit of progress. Upton Sinclair's narrative captures this disregard through imagery like \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair aims to highlight the environmental destruction resulting from such industrial pollution, emphasizing the owners' indifference to the detrimental impact on people and animals. The toxic emissions from the factories and the waste runoff from numerous cattle pens in Packingtown exemplify this neglect.\n\nMoreover, the employers exhibit a lack of empathy towards their workforce, who toil to generate wealth for them. In their relentless quest to maximize profits, they disregard the well-being of their employees: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are subjected to grueling hours and face sudden layoffs without any severance or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in The Jungle, few, if any, laws safeguarded workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to impose harsh working conditions and accelerate production. While the narrative does not explicitly state it, those laboring in Packingtown were expected to endure these dire circumstances both at work and at home. At the time, no organizations existed to provide support or guidance to the laborers. Although unions were established, they often exploited the workers rather than aiding them, exacerbating their plight. The workers, trapped in an oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" stands as one of Edgar Allan Poe’s own acclaimed poems. Within this work, Poe references “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56, a term that Mabbott links to Virgil, who mentioned it as an island located north of Britain, believed by the Greeks to be the world's boundary. Although Virgil indeed used the term, there exists a more contemporary source deserving recognition. Poe held a keen interest in German writers.\n\nThis reference is crucial as it highlights Poe's awareness of Goethe's literature. Karl J. Arndt, in his study \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes parallels between their poems, suggesting Poe might have been influenced by Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a celebrated poet and playwright, known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within \"Faust's\" second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates a king’s grief following his wife's death, symbolized by a goblet she gifted him. Consumed by sorrow, he drinks excessively, ultimately deciding to end his life. He bequeaths his possessions to his children, except the goblet, which he casts into the sea from a cliff before closing his eyes forever. The king’s portrayal in \"The King of Thulé\" bears a resemblance to the depiction in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe’s own struggles and reliance on alcohol. \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe incorporated \"Thule\" in “The Pit and the Pendulum.”\n\nPoe refers to Thule on two occasions in his works. He mentions “ultima Thule” in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses it twice in “Dream-Land,” framing the poem. The two pieces, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" can be interpreted as companions. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule’s landscape as dark and desolate, haunted by memories of deceased friends, and enveloped in a colorless shade. These elements resonate with Goethe’s “The King of Thule,” where the protagonist mourns his wife’s loss, feeling isolated and devoid of purpose to rule or live. The poem reads as if the speaker has entered into Goethe’s narrative.\n\nGoethe was an influential figure, one Poe would likely have been familiar with, if only for his admiration of Tennyson. When asked about Tennyson, Poe spoke highly of him. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe’s work through the numerous reproductions that followed its initial publication.",
            "In the state of California, is it possible for a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to receive punitive damages by proving the store manager acted maliciously because he was twice informed of the spill but neglected to clean it for thirty minutes as he was having dinner? A judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from those actions, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the likely harm from ignoring the spill, as multiple D&D customers had been injured in similar incidents in the months before Palmer's mishap; yet despite this awareness, he did not ensure the spill was addressed. Although Palmer’s assertion that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it still holds weight given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin did not take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, around 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and didn’t have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin about the spill, to which he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm on that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and the decision on whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim is under consideration.\n\nIn California, punitive damages may be recovered for a breach of an obligation not stemming from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined by the statute as conduct intended to cause harm, or in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and carried out with \"a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others,\" as stated in § (c)(1). Courts have described actions as malicious when done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and willfully and deliberately failed to avert those consequences,\" as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Ever since she could remember, there was always an emptiness within her, a longing that seemed insatiable. This feeling began to manifest when she was around 14, just stepping into the world of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling persisted. By then, she realized she was yearning for someone, not something. Despite this realization, no boys sparked her interest. Some boys had shown interest in her, trying awkwardly to win over someone who seemed unattainable, but none captured her attention. She frequently pondered this unusual predicament, questioning why a teenage girl like her would feel this way. Years of reflection yielded various theories, but none she found convincing enough to dwell on. Thus, she continued her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nDays at home were usually serene. Her parents were gentle and composed individuals. They rarely argued with each other and seldom with their daughter. Their only disputes revolved around her asserting her independence and vibrant personality. Despite being the child of such tranquil parents, she contrasted their calm demeanor with her lively and engaging nature, which made her quite likable, complemented by her kind-heartedness.\n\nToday, however, was anything but calm. As she moved from one room to another, seeking new inspiration, a sudden scream echoed from the kitchen, her mother's lovely voice. Panic-stricken, she dashed to the kitchen, her heart racing as she asked anxiously, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" There she found her mother on the floor, clearly in distress, repeatedly whispering \"Ow\" in short, labored breaths. She rushed to her mother's side, placing a reassuring hand on her. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother's words were hurried and strained, and it was clear she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help you.\" Guided by her mother, she was grateful for the strength she had gained from her physical training. She carefully carried her mother to the car, laid her down in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scent of disinfectant and an air of anxiety. But she hardly noticed, her mind solely focused on her mother's well-being. She swiftly brought her mother inside, calling out for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a gurney to lay her mother on. They promptly took her for examination, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had toppled from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf in their cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality due to stroke. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet and is marked by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in place of saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. The diet also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of CVD or diabetes, were monitored as part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year span. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Instances of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, these were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified as such. For each FFQ, calculations were made for body mass index, smoking status, use of aspirin, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and more accurately reflect long-term dietary consumption, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from the two preceding years. Adjustments for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) were made by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke categories.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2,391 incident cases of CHD, 1,763 incident cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "A sign declares that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone at a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this unsettling message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country witnessed a series of street protests, the first in a decade. These demonstrations, led by numerous Burmese monks, were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the Burmese government tolerated these peaceful gatherings, but as public interest grew, the situation deteriorated into a violent conflict between the monks and the military junta. The military began raiding monasteries across the nation. Foreign journalists were arrested on the spot, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, merely for covering a protest. Official reports claim 13 deaths, but Colonel Hla Win, who recently defected, suggested that fatalities were in the thousands.\n\nSuch events are not unprecedented. Governments have long sought to suppress dissent to maintain absolute control over their people. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their authority over all societal aspects. Japanese emperors were viewed as deities, meant to guide their people to success. Meanwhile, then U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly held regular calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, linked to the Republic Party.\n\nSome notorious examples include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students rallied against the government's authoritarianism. Death toll estimates from these protests vary widely, from 200-300 according to official Chinese reports to 2,000-3,000 as per the Chinese Red Cross. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militias, supported by the government, systematically exterminating Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, where Jews were systematically persecuted and killed across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz can be largely attributed to his extensive career and his exceptional skill in shaping his orchestra's sound. While his piano contributions are often understated in many of the pieces considered for this assignment, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his ability to craft intricate and layered compositions that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He created a structure that allowed soloists the freedom to improvise, while also composing tightly orchestrated pieces that leveraged the distinctive styles of his musicians to bring musical concepts to life. This approach not only spotlighted individual musicians but also enhanced the overall tone of the orchestra, resulting in cohesive and inventive soundscapes tailored to each composition. Ellington's adeptness at understanding both individual and collective sound within his ensemble enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nIn its discussion of Ellington's sound and innovative approach, the Grove Music dictionary cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's technique of using voice to add depth and color, unencumbered by lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. As a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece, it unfolds over six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Engages in a call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, then shifting to a coarser tone by the end.\nChorus 2: Features a muted trumpet solo that expands on the main melody, highlighting several elongated blue notes.\nChorus 3: Presents a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtly syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The entire band echoes the first chorus with call and response from the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: Acts as the climactic point, with reeds initiating a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with voice and reeds engaging in call and response. Here, the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, functioning as an instrumental solo.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending from a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add tonal dimension to this piece exemplifies a hallmark of his style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington marries his gift for precise orchestration with his sensitivity to tonal color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal quality of Miley's trumpet with Cox's instrumental-like voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, with Ellington employing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a fixture in his orchestra, to great effect as he introduces the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "What drives the evolutionary paths of organisms? Are there limitations or constraints that steer the course of evolutionary transformations? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” and this observation still holds true today. In more recent times, researchers have applied mathematical modeling to study the general patterns of mollusk skeletogenesis through both their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research focuses on how mathematical modeling of changes during the development and evolutionary history of Prunum, along with experimental studies, can illuminate the processes that determine the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be employed to simulate both theoretical and real skeletal structures. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of theoretical shell forms to explore the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be imagined as a structure that moves through a 360-degree space over time. These rotations or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which are envisioned as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the core of the shell and is termed the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can differ, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The “standard” orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex directed upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls is outlined below. First, the shell is viewed from the apical perspective to determine where the initial suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted starting from this line and are measured to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures that progress through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. It is feasible to trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has experienced little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the nation is progressing well towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, including those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health remain insufficient to reach the 2015 targets. The underlying reasons for these gaps will be explored below, highlighting the necessity of enhancing the health system over isolated programmatic solutions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now falling into this category. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who may lack the ability to handle complicated pregnancies (which contributes to the high incidence of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). Thus, the apparent progress in this area is somewhat misleading, and significant improvements are still needed. Additionally, there has been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea receiving treatment from a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is not comprehensive, it is evident that this remains a critical issue, with low service rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain unexpectedly low at around 4%. This statistic also highlights a concerning issue of disparity. While the c-section rate is 7% in urban areas, it drops to merely 2% in rural regions, indicating unequal healthcare access across the country. Access issues are also evident in terms of vertical equity, with a 27% difference in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. The poorer segments of society face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAs we consider steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can service deficiencies be most effectively tackled? Specifically, should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific strategies or work towards reinforcing the overall health system without concentrating solely on maternal and child care before and after pregnancy? While programmatic solutions for the outlined issues are appealing due to their focused and manageable goals, which typically yield quicker results, there are potential drawbacks. A significant downside is that prioritizing a specific health sector can lead to diminished funding for others, drawing human resources away (a scenario seen with the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on the family planning sector). Moreover, operating several parallel programs for a single area can result in service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing paperwork and supply requisition challenges.",
            "Over the last century, the categorization of popular music has evolved to include an overwhelming number of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all comprehensively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, among others—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and further subdivisions. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness lies in its ability to convey a broad spectrum of emotions, typically leaning towards the darker end. Its diversity became apparent shortly after the genre emerged, as enthusiasts recognized its adaptability and began experimenting to create new sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that persists to this day.\n\nAt present, the heavy metal movement has reached a stage where the abundance of niche groups makes defining heavy metal itself a challenge. Despite incorporating numerous elements from other genres, heavy metal, like all music, has its origins. To truly grasp the essence of today's metal music, one must first comprehend the metal movement and why it is perceived as a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal represents a movement characterized by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. With less primitivism and more technical prowess, musicians in metal bands demonstrate notable instrumental skill, evident in their music. Metal is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement heavily influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug wave of the mid-1970s led people to experiment with wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a creative catalyst. It embodies many dark, visceral elements, a stark contrast to the lighter qualities prevalent in much of popular music. Furthermore, later metal generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, intense characteristics prevalent in the Romantic Era, with lyrics that reflect the movement's inherent darkness.\n\nAn example is found in the lyrics of \"Helter Skelter,\" which reveal the darker side of the Beatles. The song portrays an erratic journey, often interpreted as drug-induced. Considered by some as one of the inaugural Heavy Metal songs, it was a reaction to a Rolling Stones track with a similarly heavy, dark tone. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their capacity to match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include this song on The White Album.",
            "Some years prior to the emergence of Surrealist painters and their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own visions, both in reality and imagination. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the enchanting landscape of her dream, but also encapsulates Rousseau’s personal aspirations and challenges as an artist. From the onset of his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers and art enthusiasts. This pursuit led to a profound internal conflict: should he imitate prevalent artistic styles to gain acceptance within the critical art community he cherished, or should he chart his own course, embracing a unique creative expression? \n\nTo appreciate The Dream through this lens, it is essential to understand Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a modest lifestyle (Shattuck 47). Lacking formal artistic education, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty, despite being mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector or douanier (Shattuck 46). After the tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving him with only one surviving daughter, Julia, Rousseau sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start (Shattuck 49). Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized rural life, Rousseau remained a folk painter, reflecting the ambitions and dreams typical of his social class.\n\nRousseau’s preoccupation with gaining acceptance in the art world is understandable when considering his background: he was self-taught, started his artistic career later in life, and was creating alongside many renowned modern artists. Despite years of dedication, Rousseau only began receiving recognition around the same time as Matisse, who was establishing his artistic reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that while Rousseau and Matisse were artistic rivals, they differed in their approach and motivation: “Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, whereas Rousseau longed to create art so conventional it would secure him a place with the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Numerous intellectuals have speculated about the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I think there's a fundamental reason for this connection. John Keats, in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we understand in life comes through education or personal experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics without needing explicit teaching. Both fields aim more to describe than to prescribe. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why an artwork or piece of literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, instead of laying out rules for determining or creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nCritiques of art or morals often fall short of capturing the true essence of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully explain why it is considered great art. When people are asked about their favorite artwork or literature, they often start with something like, \"There's just something about it,\" before offering a more detailed or critical analysis. I believe both art and morals cannot be wholly reduced to descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a piece of literature, there's something beyond that remains. I think ethics shares this feature. Wittgenstein remarks, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this \"something,\" this indescribable quality, is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and it's this transcendental characteristic that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a profound, almost ineffable level. They touch us in ways that can be felt but not fully articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean comments, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a diverse tapestry of culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the coastal city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. This cultural richness is evident from Cologne on the Rhine River, through Germany's heartland, reaching the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It is unsurprising that contemporary Germany is a product of various origins and tribes, given its unique cultural heritage.\n\nThe land historically known as Germania is the ancestral home of the Germans, though the origins of its name are debated among academics. Tacitus suggested that it originated from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he described conflicts with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine with questionable intentions. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. Some scholars speculate that the name may refer to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In his commentary on the wars, Caesar noted, “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Other theories suggest the name might derive from the weapon they used, a spear known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" reflecting the Germans' boisterous nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, the Roman historian Tacitus described the origins of the Germans: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWhy would anyone abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They occasionally launched campaigns into Germania for resources but generally returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they settled at the edges of the Roman Empire, trading goods and offering their skills as soldiers within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the theme of disguise plays a critical role, suggesting that while it can effectively sustain deception for extended periods, ultimately, individuals must abandon these false identities to avoid losing their true selves. A significant challenge in ending such a deception is the potential alienation that may follow. Therefore, one faces a choice between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. Some might respond indifferently to being deceived, while others may feel deeply offended by the ruse.\n\nThe issue of deception is particularly complex when it involves gender role reversal, raising questions such as why someone would feel compelled to abandon their identity and assume the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola's situation, her disguise serves as a protective measure: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola adopts a male persona to safeguard herself against potential threats. Her strategy succeeds, but it also distances her from the women who could have supported her. Complicating matters further, Olivia, mistaking Viola for Sebastian, falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary readers, Twelfth Night might be viewed as a narrative exploring how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for characters like Olivia and Orsino. Certain parts of the play suggest that these characters confront subconscious feelings prompted by Viola/Cesario's presence. For instance, Olivia's attraction to Cesario raises the question of whether she is drawn to the perceived masculinity or if she harbors latent feelings for women. However, it is more plausible that Shakespeare intended Olivia to satirize those of his era who judge others based solely on appearances. This is supported by how easily Olivia transfers her affections to Sebastian and starts viewing Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Observers have often highlighted the harshness of German colonial rule, particularly regarding the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. While such a generalization cannot fully capture the complexity of an entire colonial empire, it is important to recognize that the German colonial territories differed widely in terms of policies and governance styles, reflecting their geographic diversity. Similarly, educational initiatives varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in places like Kamerun and other colonies were acknowledged positively by contemporary writers.\n\nThe circumstances in South West Africa (now Namibia) were markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government was proactive in establishing state schools and significantly involved in the education of the local population, in South West Africa, educational responsibilities for the native inhabitants were largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. Conversely, substantial resources were allocated to the education of Europeans in the colony, with the establishment of state schools and increased support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies had notable numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this distinct experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on recent research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is an abundance of literature specifically addressing education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works are in German, written during or shortly after the period of German colonial dominance. Early writings primarily sought to outline the characteristics of educational systems in these territories. Subsequent English-language studies expanded the analysis through comparative examinations of education across different German colonies and more in-depth evaluations of specific educational elements. These studies highlighted notable disparities in educational systems among various colonies. The most significant work addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s analysis of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors that led to their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nRelative to Germany’s other colonial territories, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, though much of the land is arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable living conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an illustration of two countries that once experienced a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 marked the peak of this conflict, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, finally subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes between Americans and Mexicans over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31). \n\nThis scenario is similar to many other countries that maintain an enduring rivalry with a neighboring nation. Countries sharing borders often encounter conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are comparable to other long-standing rivalries between nations with shared borders. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally enjoyed amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a division between the United States and Mexico, a challenge that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) mentions that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly an ideological struggle and partly a competition over crucial interests, the U.S.-Mexico ideological tensions were rooted in religious preferences. This mistrust stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, and these inherited feelings posed a significant hurdle in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, involved territorial issues related to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations exerted military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) points out that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109), eventually concluding as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen illness left me suddenly disabled, a condition I had never encountered before.\n\nAt that time, I was working as a nurse. I had chosen this career path driven by a profound need for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. \"Nursing will always provide job opportunities; people will always need healthcare,\" was the advice I repeatedly heard as I grew up. Although my true aspirations were to become a scientist or a journalist—or ideally a blend of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, with no financial savings to rely on, and unable to work. Even now, after 15 years of depending on Social Security Disability, I have very little that I can call my own. Every day remains a challenge, continuously undermining my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty defines my life, yet one thing remains clear: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends, regardless of my inner strength. When true disaster hits, any sense of strength quickly diminishes.\n\nThe reality is that life is filled with both major and minor emergencies. No amount of preparation can guarantee a smooth path; some challenges are simply too immense to tackle alone.\n\nI fully agree that we in the U.S. should not rely solely on the government, whose systems are deteriorating. I would prefer to see Americans rediscovering trust in each other—learning to offer and accept help—rather than each of us building isolated defenses.\n\nConservative rhetoric often praises \"rugged individualism\" as a cornerstone of American history. However, the truth is that our ancestors endured hardships through compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. Pioneers who ventured across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't succeed by going it alone.\n\nTherefore, while it’s important to be prepared—I am, with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned food—it's equally crucial to connect with your neighbors.\n\nIf you have the means to cultivate a small farm or preserve your own food, it's a wise choice. A wood stove is also advantageous, provided you don’t live in an apartment.\n\nYet, as you take these steps, make an effort to get to know those around you.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, later known as Buddha, was born. Throughout his lifetime, he chose to leave worldly life behind and reached enlightenment, which gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. With a history spanning about 2,500 years, Buddhism has evolved and looks quite distinct from what it was during Buddha’s time. This evolution is evident, for example, in Sri Lanka—a Theravada Buddhist country—where an annual water-cutting ceremony is held. This event involves both monks and laypeople and holds religious significance, even though Buddha did not mention such festivities. These changes range from surface-level traditions to the deep soteriological essence of the faith. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monks and lay followers, has adapted its doctrinal principles due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, and both positive and negative.\n\nSeveral key terms will be used frequently in this discussion. The distinction between internal and external forces is crucial. Internal forces are those arising from members within the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm or disrupt the Buddhist community, stemming from negative views of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community, though their impact may inadvertently be beneficial or detrimental. These concepts will be referenced throughout the discussion.\n\nTo start with, it is essential to explore the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka includes the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering of life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth. Upon enlightenment, Sansara ceases, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more strict rules. The four noble truths are central to Buddhism: first, the truth of Dukkha, that life is suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation, the influence of culture is profound. Culture is often understood by what it isn't, as much as by what it is and what it represents. It doesn't conform to a single mold, nor can it be pinned down to a specific entity. It's neither singular nor uniform. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently general and overly reductive. While grasping cultural generalizations can be useful, it is far more beneficial for a negotiator to comprehend the relevance of culture to the issue at hand and how that culture's perspective might influence the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, one interprets it relative to their own, naturally drawing comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding another culture or mindset can involve a range of activities, from exploring its historical context to recognizing its biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one should embrace it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, and especially when in a less advantageous bargaining position. Similarly, if negotiating on foreign ground, showing respect for local customs and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance discussions.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to national or international distinctions. Many businesses within a nation cultivate their own unique corporate culture. For example, some corporate cultures may prioritize extended office hours, while others may adopt a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in dress codes, communication styles (whether direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some organizations promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others limit it to specific \"company-approved\" initiatives. Examining the variations in American corporate culture across different companies (and even within regions or between urban and suburban settings) highlights the diversity of perspectives within a societal culture. While some cultures may appear less stratified than American culture and seem more uniform to outsiders, this similarity is merely an invitation to delve deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more critical, as they reveal the reasoning behind a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success in negotiations. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining will not necessarily rush to settle. Considering these generalities is crucial before entering negotiations. However, it is advantageous for a negotiator to personally understand their counterpart to make the negotiation truly effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This perspective seems to be shared by Thomas Aquinas, the other thinker we are examining. Since both philosophers argue for the existence of the same deity, our task is to assess which argument is more compelling. For the sake of efficiency, we will assume they both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. If we were to consider a different kind of deity, it would not allow for a fair comparison of their arguments, as both focus on defending a particular understanding of God. With that in mind, I propose that while both philosophers offer important insights, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo clarify this point, let's first explore St. Anselm's fundamental argument. His approach involves attaining knowledge through faith, encouraging individuals to seek evidence of God within themselves. Anselm argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot genuinely imagine His absence. Although his terminology can be intricate and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the proof of God's existence is found within our minds. Anselm implies that we need not look beyond our inner selves to discover the truth about God, as His existence is validated by examining our inherent understanding. This acceptance of concepts without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian doctrine.\n\nThis notion contrasts sharply with that of St. Thomas Aquinas, who believes that God's existence can be entirely demonstrated through logic and empirical evidence, negating the necessity of faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, a critical aspect of Christianity, as it allows for persuading potential converts through reason alone, independent of their readiness to accept unprovable beliefs. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially argues that God's existence is a logical necessity. For instance, if informed that a puzzle piece is missing, one can deduce the existence and features of that piece through logic, even without seeing it.",
            "Authors often employ a range of strategies to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous such techniques. At times, Fitzgerald combines an unexpected adjective with a noun to create a distinctive atmosphere surrounding a subject. Alternatively, he may assign symbolic meaning to an object for the same purpose. One prominent method he employs involves the use of color symbolism, particularly with hues like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, with particular significance, subsequently using these associations to evoke certain feelings in readers about key elements.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the symbolism of white/gray as representing uniformity, with white suggesting a touch of elegance and class, while gray denotes something more aged and faded. This symbolism is introduced early on through repeated mentions of these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as being \"in white\" (8), and white attire is a common theme: Nick sports \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only notable deviation occurs when Nick describes Gatsby's party, noting that \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further clarifies the significance of these colors by applying them to mundane subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the guest list at Gatsby's parties features \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a metaphor for uniformity (28). Ordinary people and places are often depicted in shades of white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has firmly established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to denote insignificance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period with minimal mention of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more of a uniform symbol, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues to apply this technique around Daisy to reinforce the impression of her as a uniform element, as seen in references to the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress preceding the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts a highly productive agricultural sector, largely due to its mild and sunny weather. The region is known for cultivating a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries, honey, and peppers are also commonly grown. A strong demand exists for organic, community-supported agricultural produce in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are similarly sought after. Several organic farms offer tours of their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. These operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs, enhance habitats, and create avenues for farm tours and educational initiatives.  \nOrganic farming can tap into a profitable niche market while also enhancing biodiversity in local plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemical usage in the soil and water. Nonetheless, organic agriculture can be more costly compared to conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to eliminate pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses than conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms lack the economies of scale that larger operations enjoy. Activities unrelated to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and managing plant growth to create habitats, can also increase labor costs. This is why a landowner in this case might look for financial assistance or expertise to maximize profitability while maintaining high habitat quality.  \nThe land selected for this example is located near Potrero, in the unincorporated part of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres and includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, which is under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \nThis region was historically inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 1800s. This parcel of land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the decades.  \nI selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore what realistic options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. To model what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful, indelible tie. This relationship encompasses various emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers share a unique understanding, deeper than any other bond, often seeing their own reflection in each other. The true essence of this bond reveals itself in moments of adversity, whether it manifests in a positive or negative light. These emotions, when laid bare, come with significant repercussions. Grasping the feelings that arise from this brotherly connection also involves reckoning with their resulting outcomes. When one brother meets the gaze of another and perceives his own image, he sees not the person others do, but his authentic self. It is in their behaviors and the outcomes of those behaviors that their genuine character is revealed. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers and the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a richly detailed environment, these boys embark on a journey destined for failure. Intense pride clashes with bitter disappointment in a dramatic climax, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is depicted through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview that greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are motivated by one dominant emotion: pride. From his first outing with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother he could teach skills like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He desired a companion for races to Horsehead Landing or to sit with at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, these aspirations were unattainable due to Doodle's fragile heart condition, which made survival uncertain and vigorous activity nearly impossible. For the young protagonist, whose mind was filled with grand dreams, this reality was devastating. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle at times, recalling a moment when he considered smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would entertain thoughts of such a drastic action? Yet, his resolve falters when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that instills hope in the protagonist, suggesting his commitment was never truly strong. An innate love for his brother lingered in his heart.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and innovative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from its rudimentary stages to the contemporary era, the metaphors describing the brain have similarly progressed. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, and a book, it is now often compared to a computer. However, when studying the brain, it is important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe process of handling information begins with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory data is continuously transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white backdrop, bottom-up processing assembles basic details such as color, orientation, and the object's boundaries—where the color noticeably shifts over a brief distance—to conclude that a box is being observed. Top-down processing utilizes decisions from earlier stages of bottom-up processing to hasten the recognition of the box, aiding in identifying it as a black box instead of a hole in the white background.\n\nAs information undergoes processing, an attention filter determines the significance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be directed towards. While the brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures they aren't individually noticeable. Conversely, you might distinctly hear your name in a noisy room. Processing occurs in numerous stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. Memory exists in several forms, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with each type of sensory stimulus having specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal inputs can be encoded based on their appearance, sound, or meaning. After storage, information needs to be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be sustained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some drawing from human memory retrieval patterns, others from computer science, and still others from neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, connected based on their relationships. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might link to “table,” which could connect to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Back in 2007, the U.S. found itself grappling with a severe financial crisis that had far-reaching impacts. There were significant spikes in unemployment rates, the housing market collapsed, and many of the nation's major corporations faced devastation. The recession lingers on, prompting us to question the origins of this crisis and consider potential solutions. At its core, the financial turmoil was a result of imprudent political choices that encouraged financial institutions to issue risky sub-prime loans within an underdeveloped economic framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to support and transform these loans into complex financial products. As borrowers began to default, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the repercussions spread through the economy.\n\nThe origins of the crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to bolster his chances for reelection. The strategy involved loosening lending regulations to gain favor among the populace, inadvertently laying the groundwork for the sub-prime mortgage disaster that would unfold seven years later. A 1999 report by Steven Holmes in the New York Times highlighted the pressures faced by Fannie Mae to increase lending to lower-income groups, driven by both the administration's push and shareholder expectations for profit growth. Holmes presciently warned of potential issues during economic downturns, suggesting a possible government bailout reminiscent of the 1980s savings and loan crisis.\n\nSeveral elements contributed to the economic downturn, not least of which were the complex mortgage structures that became prevalent. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations entangled various economic sectors with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and heightened vulnerability to price fluctuations. When the housing bubble finally burst, financial entities holding these securities suffered significant losses. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing nearly a third of the country's GDP. This led to the sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch at significantly reduced prices, the disbandment of Lehman Brothers, and the transformation of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government oversight by September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—a section of your narrative where you spread your creative wings and soar, captivating everyone with your enchanting, if not mesmerizing, prose. Alternatively, it might be where your audience dozes off or clicks away, lamenting your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to express frustration at her screen when overwhelmed by an excess of information, and not in a delightful manner.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are familiar with the writing adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself entangled in lengthy passages where nothing unfolds, or worse, too much does. Exposition is that mischievous spirit whispering in your ear to clear the historical clutter before getting to the exciting parts (not to be mistaken with the other spirit urging you to share every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition entails narrating events to the audience, often using straightforward language. In cinema, exposition occurs when a character reveals a bulk of information to another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it is the author who does the narrating.\n\nAn illustration is warranted. As you explore a story, you are informed that the heroine encountered her beloved at a specific place and time, they married in a grand ceremony, and her husband was tragically murdered before her eyes. You would not anticipate this entire sequence to span two pages, with both characters receiving only two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to invest time in developing the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior the depth of his love for his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to exhibit, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the narrative later states that this was indeed the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would foster emotional investment in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, insights into her thoughts, beliefs, and aspirations as mirrored in his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his loss alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance on the simple outline of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your duty to provide that substance. (*examines metaphor, sighs, ventures forward*) It can be tempting to gloss over certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, aware that he once served in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a \"live\" segment on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The leading story was about a man from Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; her name wasn't mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and he appeared quite sinister. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still unfolding. The details provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I felt they allocated a suitable amount of time to this news.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At that time, no arrests had been made, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the incident. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might be because it involved a \"black\" man or occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped, missing, or a victim of a crime, the media usually provides extensive coverage; however, if a minority is involved, it's rare for it to be mentioned.\n\nThe following story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about where they believed the incident took place. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers is offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next segment was about the forecasted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was brief, likely to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nAdditionally, there was a report about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. They mentioned he was about six feet tall and weighed around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they placed an unusual emphasis on his race and complexion.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a twenty-five-year prison sentence, they stated \"300\" months. I am unsure of their intention, whether it was to make it sound harsher or for another reason. They also noted he was Hispanic, which I felt was unnecessary information for the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund, commonly known as an ETF, is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, yet offers greater flexibility by being traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF combines the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase just a single share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, one downside is the necessity to pay commissions on ETF trades, akin to those on stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast array of available funds. Though these benefits are highlighted, it is wise for a prudent financial investor to assess whether benefits like diversification genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will scrutinize the ETF IHF and contrast it with its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and to explore if there are better configurations of these stocks for an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, it becomes impractical to include every holding; thus, we have chosen to focus only on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Here are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use the current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to compute each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The calculations for Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio with just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top ten holdings is also .12 lower than the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, there exists a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from one another.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In looking back at Figure 17, a significant decline in commuter log submissions was noticeable by the third month of the project, which was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter at a New England university might have contributed to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when individuals are occupied with wrapping up academic responsibilities and grading, potentially causing the commuter log to be overlooked. The busy holiday season and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty, who often do not need to be on campus during this period, could also be factors. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might explain the low log submissions for that time. However, February's low submissions remain puzzling. It might be that projects like these naturally experience an initial surge in enthusiasm that wanes over time. To address this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, maintaining project momentum was challenging, particularly due to the natural drop in engagement and the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another hurdle faced by this project, and similar initiatives, is that personal car use, with its associated freedom and flexibility, is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, such as gift certificates to local dining establishments, coffee shops, massage services, an independent bookstore, and some larger national retailers. However, it would have been intriguing to observe how larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric vehicle, might have influenced participation and potentially mitigated the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing their value over time might have been beneficial. Initially, the gift cards were well-received, but announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles in December or a hybrid or electric car in January, could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the early Edison films collection at the Library of Congress, I was intrigued by the category of trick films, so I decided to watch all fifteen produced between 1895 and 1901. These films are known for their use of inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis centered on detailing the aesthetics of most trick films and identifying unique features in some of the later examples. Typically, trick films from this era were studio-bound, shot within a frontal proscenium, featured static cameras, relied on long and medium shots, and followed a strict one shot per film method. However, a few films at the beginning of the 20th century started to challenge these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is their use of interior sets framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains static, not following any figures or objects. This approach, common in early cinema, has its origins in theatrical productions, as well as vaudeville and magic shows for trick films. One limitation of this stage-based setup is that actors in trick films typically move only side-to-side, avoiding movement toward or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains stationary.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also results in predominantly long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in Edison’s trick films because, much like in theater and vaudeville, the audience sees the entire performance within the stage's frame. Therefore, the actors do not approach the camera from the middle ground, eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nIn general, early trick films adhere to the format where one conceptual shot represents an entire film. This constraint keeps most trick films under a minute long, influenced by the frames per second used. It also limits the narrative or dramatic potential, as these films primarily focus on brief vaudeville-style acts like magic, vanishing, and transformations with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot to the audience doesn't always equate to a single physical shot. What appears as one shot may be a series of shots seamlessly combined to create illusions like appearing or disappearing. A closer look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) reveals the transition to the shot with Mary's \"head\" being severed, showcasing how, despite appearing as one continuous shot, multiple shots are used to achieve the trick.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is intriguingly a contradiction in terms, as Ian Watt elaborates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" The Gothic genre has experienced mixed opinions, having been both criticized for lacking depth and celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto is considered the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blending elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to forge the beginnings of the Gothic genre and introduce a novel form of literary expression. Walpole integrates \"old\" theatrical components with 'new' emulations of nature found in 'modern' novels, coining it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often revisits medieval gothic theater, architecture, and customs. At the time The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or lacking sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of the dramatic \"Gothic\" with the novel's format, which offers a deeper insight into characters' psyches, is what has enabled Gothic literature to endure over time, appearing both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its initial creation.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and altered in the first Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the ideal knight—courageous, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of those ideals in society, a sentiment shared by Walpole. By using chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized, hinting at the future shift from Gothic to Romantic, and is employed to critique and potentially enhance the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was navigating a politically tumultuous era and was concerned about what lay ahead. Engrossed in politics and facing potentially unjust accusations, he might have begun to believe, perhaps subconsciously, that the moral integrity and intrinsic \"goodness\" of the gothic era had somehow faded from contemporary society. This notion is evident in his portrayal of several characters, notably Frederic. Before even encountering Frederic, readers learn he embodies numerous chivalric qualities; he is described as:\n\nFrederic is depicted with many traditional chivalric attributes; he is primarily a prince who has endured suffering, been profoundly impacted by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, amplified, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic motif of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of steps that facilitate the transfer of goods from the initial customer order through various stages such as raw material sourcing, supply, production, and finally distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He defined it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing activities within the supply chain to efficiently meet customer demands. The supply chain comprises six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nProduction marks the beginning of the supply chain. It serves as the groundwork for the entire sequence, determining the logistics of when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must grasp customer preferences, often gauged by market trends, to ascertain the demand for specific products. Upon understanding market demands, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantity. Following this, they select the most suitable production facilities, balancing volume and quality to meet customer expectations. Once production sites are established, managers turn their attention to organizing workloads and maintaining equipment. This stage is crucial as it impacts the entire supply chain process; any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses. For instance, during my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, I observed that both companies had detailed guidelines for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes help businesses operate efficiently and avoid confusion regarding procedures and expectations.\n\nThe next major component of supply chain management is supply. This involves strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and the potential for outsourcing partnerships. A single product might be produced across various divisions, each with distinct equipment, staff, and expertise. It is up to management to determine which division is best suited for different stages of production. Additionally, outsourcing may be considered to enhance velocity, which refers to the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or stable.",
            "Victorian novels often stand out due to their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the period’s aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, diverge from these norms. Both books incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are uncommon for novels of that era, thereby enhancing the depth of their characters and offering greater insight into their motivations and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the narrative frequently delves into dreamlike sequences or surreal states that vary in purpose and content. These peculiar moments often reveal layers of Oliver's inner self, his suffering, and his understanding of the realities around him. In chapter 28, when Oliver's shooting incident is revisited, he experiences it as vividly as a dream, struggling to seek assistance. This passage highlights Oliver’s lack of control over the unfolding events and his precarious health condition, vividly portrayed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. As the shooting incident consumes him, his senses become numbed, and he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that rescues him; he re-experiences despair, with pain now an ever-present companion linked more to fear than surprise. This raises questions about who is responsible for Oliver's plight, as it is certainly not by his own choice. The episode emphasizes Oliver's limited control over his life, as he cannot muster the will to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at risk. The selection hints at Oliver’s growing sense of defeat, suggesting that Fagin's influence is breaking him, pushing him towards resignation and affecting his ability to respond, whereas otherwise, one might expect Oliver to make some effort for his own survival.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years back, I participated in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade, and was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. It became apparent to me that something was amiss; his issues were quite unusual. He could pronounce some letters flawlessly while others were completely elusive, which was puzzling. Adrian was of Latino heritage, which was evident, yet he spoke impeccable English. We continued to face challenges until I met his mother one day. While I was supervising a few students who stayed back when the rest went on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, not a word of English. Despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was during this interaction that I realized Adrian's issue: he could read well but was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this realization was beneficial for him in the long run, but I sincerely hope he has improved since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It serves as a testament to the fact that these barriers aren't always as apparent as one might assume. Even children who speak flawless English might encounter significant challenges in reading it. Acknowledging this problem is easy, but addressing it is another matter. In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There is no singular answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea. It benefits not only children whose first language is Spanish but all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs often surpass their peers academically. Concerns exist that such programs are resource-draining and won't benefit the majority. This is a misconception. Making these programs a standard part of the curriculum, rather than an exception, would benefit all students. But how should this be implemented? Should all teachers be required to be bilingual? No, that would be impractical and somewhat unrealistic. However, we can certainly employ bilingual aides or tutors to support these efforts.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some find this in Sunday school, others in Temple, or through personal introspection. Many accept the religions inherited from our parents, but some dismiss them, believing there's nothing beyond their own self-centered universe. We might embrace one belief system only to later replace it with another. Regardless of the path taken, we seek to understand a part of ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives, looking for a guiding light to lead us from darkness into clarity.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he said, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain drum against the tin roof as we smoked. Rainwater cascaded from the gutters, flooding the plants nearby. Dad gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed both reflective and reminiscent. He had lost weight over the past months, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser. He continued to avoid eye contact, and I felt isolated, scared, unable to express how much I'd miss him, fearing that speaking it out loud would make it more real for us both. I hugged him, then moved my chair closer, joining him in watching the rain fall in the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away that December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his pain, only prolonged his life beyond doctors' predictions; what was gained by extending his suffering, I couldn't understand. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I didn't pray. If God existed, I felt he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him transition from this life to whatever comes next. So, I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that gave me life come to an end. I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to witness his passing. I stayed curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for Republicanism in his time. While his primary occupation was in agriculture, his brief political career also shaped his reputation as a passionate and vocal defender of personal freedom and governance. His steadfast belief in an agriculture-based society influenced most of his thoughts on government affairs. He strived to protect and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions, which in turn impacted his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the formation of the United States as a unique chance to establish an exemplary system of governance, unburdened by entrenched traditions. This allowed for the creation of a self-governing framework. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, considering these rights interconnected—if one is denied, the others suffer, diminishing their worth. Thus, he argued that these rights should remain outside governmental control. He contended that what was often termed the “state of nature” favored those with physical strength and cunning, but insisted that in a civilized society, this should not be the norm.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges humanity's inherent virtues and vices. He held strong views on moral duality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). To him, good principles were those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. A government founded on such principles, he believed, would operate justly, even when led by self-interest and greed. He saw self-interest as a natural human motivation, only deemed negative when it led to societal structures exploiting others. A sound government, he believed, was essential for curbing humanity's natural malevolence and needed vigilant oversight to prevent the infusion of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a Federal government with highly limited powers, restricted to those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government could become costly and tyrannical. Nonetheless, he cautioned that a mere literal interpretation could be perilous without considering the framers' intentions, as such an approach might become corrupted. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, emphasizing its depiction of the nation as a coalition of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind struggling to fully grasp the scenery laid out before me. In a detached and quiet manner, I assessed the sight with an awareness that chose not to connect it to any abstract interpretation. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it barely felt like I was thinking at all; it was more like I was simply experiencing the scene in front of me. \n\nOnce, upon the suggestion of an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art guide titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Ever since I was a child of six, I had aspired to draw, and this book offered lessons on everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain perceives lines. One of its methods was to frame any picture the artist wished to study with a square. This technique transformed a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a more manageable image: just the bowl of fruit on a simple plane.\n\nIn that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist’s frame. I was overwhelmed, struck with awe, able only to stand and marvel. Picasso had a blue period, Monet cherished greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists used a spectrum of colors. If I had any ambition to view my perspective as deserving of the label Artistic, what lay before me was the inception of my creation, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creation, muscles flexing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, my mind’s intent taking shape in what could have been the most inventive moment of my life. Water swirled serenely, smooth and crystal clear. Fragments of matter detached from the whole and vanished. Muscles tensed, my hand struck the toilet handle again, more urgently. The stubborn brown parcel remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nWith a mop loosely held in my hand, feet planted a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly at the offensive bundle of processed matter left as a message for those tasked with cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some serene moments of introspection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….",
            "Young drivers are facing significant risks on the road. Various elements contribute to the alarming statistics regarding teenage drivers in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that adolescent brains are not fully developed to handle the challenges of driving. Additionally, lack of experience is a major factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to incidents like rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road.\n\nTeenagers are particularly vulnerable when driving with friends, a situation they frequently find themselves in. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center demonstrated a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented measures such as provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and the presence of other minors as passengers to enhance teen driver safety.\n\nHowever, I view provisional licenses as temporary fixes. The core problem is that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unprepared to manage driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even argues that 18 years old might still be too young for a standard driver’s license. His research, highlighted by USA Today, suggests that individuals under 19-20 are often driven by a desire for thrill-seeking. It would therefore be logical to delay licensing until this behavior starts to diminish. Continuing to allow young teenagers to drive could result in increasing numbers of fatal accidents, with a potentially overwhelming death toll as more Baby Boomer offspring reach driving age by 2010.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver’s education programs to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be permitted to drive. A provisional permit could still be granted before a full license, with a requirement for a certain number of practical training hours. This requirement could align with current standards in most states, such as California’s mandate of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across states, a uniform national policy on this matter would be a sensible and potentially effective way to safeguard teenagers nationwide.\n\nThe legislative approach I propose is not a groundbreaking concept.",
            "This essay explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise explanation of what the disorder entails. Following this, it delves into how CAPD is diagnosed, highlighting typical signs or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes by suggesting strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), CAPD is narrowly defined as the perceptual processing of auditory information within the CNS and the neurobiologic activities that underlie such processing, resulting in electrophysiologic auditory potentials. Essentially, this means that while individuals with CAPD can hear normally, the part of the brain tasked with interpreting sounds and distinguishing speech from background noise does not function as expected.\n\nThe origins of what is now known as CAPD trace back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers began assessing children with communicative disorders. In 1954, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing diagnostic tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) that is involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A pivotal national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD among children.\n\nCAPD can present itself in various forms. Individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially, differentiate between multiple sound occurrences, recognize sound patterns, or detect changes in speech, such as tone indicating sarcasm. They might experience difficulty when one sound overlaps with another, lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful interpretations, or have trouble perceiving the order of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of listening behaviors and auditory functions, carried out by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. This process may include the use of questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to auditory stimuli (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool or test with a high success rate, nor is there a known cause for CAPD. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously, requiring them to distinguish between specific elements, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments might involve measuring acoustic signals within the ear and observing the responses to these signals.",
            "My educational journey in social work is driven by a desire to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where my goal is to support children who have experienced abuse or neglect and to assist families in distress. I bring to the field values such as service, respect, ethics, and a dedication to fostering better relationships while continuously improving my professional abilities to stay effective in my work. These principles are not only fundamental to social work but are also deeply significant to me on a personal level.\n\nHelping others has always been my aspiration, though I initially struggled to identify the exact career path I wanted. During high school and college, I observed many people who avoided confronting their challenges, and some adopted poor coping strategies. These observations motivated me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain about my career direction after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took some time off. That summer, I happened to visit a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. He was there seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had involved the police at his parents' home. Wanting to help, I went over to his parents' house to express my concerns privately to the officers, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as legally they couldn't intervene for the teenager. When I spoke to the parents, they were uneasy and offered excuses for their son’s behavior, labeling his actions as “manipulative” for involving others in “simple” family matters. This incident propelled me to seriously contemplate a career in social work to aid children facing such “simple” familial conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of social work that holds significant importance for me. Society often emphasizes the value of the individual and mourns those we lose, yet the societal idea of the “individual” often follows outdated norms rather than true uniqueness. If society mourns individuals, why do we strive for uniformity? I cherish my individuality and resist conforming to others' standards. Throughout my time in high school and college, I consistently opposed social injustice through personal expression like unconventional hair and clothing, multiple ear piercings, active participation in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to the cause of social justice and will persist in challenging social inequities.",
            "This essay explores both the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks as they pertain to insomnia. The Biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical components of health. In contrast, the Sociocultural perspective examines environmental interactions and their relevance to factors like race, ethnicity, demographic information, and socioeconomic status. This analysis of insomnia evaluates these models and delves into selected research to elucidate and enhance understanding of these frameworks. The research explanations and their outcomes are then evaluated for their distinctive strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized in various ways: as primary sleep disorders, those associated with other mental disorders, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders tied to other mental disorders correlate with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional categories may stem from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia pertains to challenges in staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy includes symptoms like cataplexy and/or automatic REM. While Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological irregularities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This analysis centers on insomnia and somewhat on primary sleep disorders more broadly, in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders highlights genetic, hereditary, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research involving mice discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that facilitate sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to extend sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal studies with mice may be applicable to human studies. This indicates a genetic and environmental foundation for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could hinder one's ability to achieve restful sleep without medication. From a sociocultural viewpoint, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any modification of the receptor might naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This could adversely affect various life aspects such as education, career, and daily tasks requiring focus and repetition.",
            "For roughly two and a half years, encompassing about four and a half semesters, I've been studying at University Park. Navigating the campus poses a challenge for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls, practically the easternmost boundary of the campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Making my way from Stuart Hall to classes located in distant buildings like Willard, near the campus core, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when the weather was unfavorable, which is often the case in State College. A conversation with a slightly older alum revealed that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the main campus by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space is occupied by sports fields, massive new structures like the Creamery and the health services building, and is encircled by apartments. As the campus continues its growth, moving around becomes increasingly challenging. What could be the optimal solution for campus mobility? Bicycles are the answer. However, bikes alone won’t address the issue. Students need to ride them, and the infrastructure should accommodate cyclists’ needs.\n\nA friend of mine recently returned to cycling after several years and expressed surprise at why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he remarked, “for a while, biking wasn’t considered cool, but it’s the best way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, cycling is also the most efficient form of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many students, I now reside off-campus, just as distant from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike has been my smartest decision this year. I have classes in the Thomas building daily, which is a good 25-minute walk from my home. With a bike, that journey can be reduced to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only challenge is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my place, isn’t always an easy path, whether you're biking or walking. Walking has its merits, but I’m simply too busy for it. Without my bike, I’d have no other dependable way to reach my classes. Walking to Thomas every day would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, adding up to over two and a half hours weekly. Plus, the extra walking time to other classes and appointments would demand more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist system that underpins it, constructing a dystopian society to explore these themes. Within this society, individuals prioritize collective well-being over personal identity, being conditioned from birth to seek immediate pleasure as their ultimate goal. The citizens are mere instruments in a grand scheme, confined to a singular ideology orchestrated by the World Controller. Viewing the novel through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley’s skepticism towards these developing systems. Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification bolster the argument that Huxley's work critiques the flaws of the economic landscape emerging during his era.\n\nCapitalism is ridiculed through the Marxist idea of false consciousness, wherein ordinary people remain unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This stems from ideological control over the working class, vividly illustrated by the conditioning of the populace in \"Brave New World.\" The lower social classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy; through hypnopædia, they are driven to consume, spend, and indulge above all. This manipulation is overseen, as noted earlier, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the concept that certain social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, literally embracing an ideology that sustains the existing structure—capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes have the awareness to recognize it but largely remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, aside from characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes significantly illustrate the perceived oppression within capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are absent. The novel intentionally blurs character distinctions, even among main characters, who lack depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the intertwining rise of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent; instead, interactions are superficial, seen in the men’s comments about women focusing mainly on physical traits, like their \"pneumatic quality,\" and in the women’s candid remarks about their experiences. Moreover, the satisfaction of each social class with their position in the hierarchy reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering conformity to their roles in the community echoes Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where one of the central debates was whether Islam could be considered a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent now than it did back then. Reflecting on the period since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, moving from a hostile stance against Islam and its extremists to an increased tolerance within American society. In 2001, it would have been hard to imagine a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has a family background that includes Muslim ties.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me because, based on my understanding of his history, it seems to contradict his portrayed personality. Previously, I believed that Muhammad converted people to Islam by force, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography presents Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself, leading people to gradually recognize the 'truth' of his teachings and seek him out.\n\nInterestingly, there are notable similarities between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's 'miracles.' One striking example is when Muhammad reportedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of narration suggests the authors wanted to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and performing miracles without needing to prove himself. This narrative bothers me because it seems to diminish the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, almost as if credit is being taken from Jesus and attributed to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories aimed at providing evidence of individuals 'independently' converting to Islam. However, these accounts often appear to rely on third-party perspectives, with the narrative indicating someone heard it from someone else, and so on. While the intention might be to offer proof of these stories' authenticity, I find this approach makes the accounts seem less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the portrayal of Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge this depiction, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his lifetime quickly diverged from the path of Christian development that continued after his passing. Observing this historical progression, it becomes apparent that Christianity has gradually drifted from its origins. In today's world, there is an increasing awareness and a unique progressive trend. While some traditionalists persist and will resist any thought that extends beyond their teachings, this group may not have the influence to sway the majority. Within the Christian community, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to differentiate the doctrines that were incorporated into Christianity over time from the original intent of its founder. Though this process may take decades or even centuries, the eventual outcome seems inevitable: a significant shift back to Christianity’s original form. A growing movement will aim to peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, as if reversing the flow of time, until only the essence of what Jesus conveyed to humanity on behalf of God remains, untouched by subsequent interpretations. When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, inspiring many to worship as if they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will remain robust to guide this transition. However, as theological perspectives revert, the vast diversity within Christianity will diminish, leading to more uniform beliefs and practices. Across regions and denominations, and bridging various divisions, we will observe a shift from differences to growing similarities. Human history is replete with significant reversions. A noteworthy example is the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution. Similarly, our nation has evolved from a history of African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The impending reversion will unfold within the realm of the Christian religion, retracing history to its origins and reducing diversity along the way. It is vital to recognize that this process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? Looking back far enough, we find Judaism as the theological foundation for Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. However, the Jewish population was not uniform; it was divided among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common folk.",
            "In my view, The Jungle vividly illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest present in human nature. Individuals tend to prioritize their own welfare and strive to enhance their lives without considering those less fortunate. This theme is prominently depicted in several ways throughout the novel. A clear example is seen in the actions of the factory owners and managers, who are solely focused on expanding their businesses to the greatest extent possible. They show little concern for the obstacles or the harm they cause in their pursuit of progress. Upton Sinclair's narrative captures this disregard through imagery like \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair aims to highlight the environmental destruction resulting from such industrial pollution, emphasizing the owners' indifference to the detrimental impact on people and animals. The toxic emissions from the factories and the waste runoff from numerous cattle pens in Packingtown exemplify this neglect.\n\nMoreover, the employers exhibit a lack of empathy towards their workforce, who toil to generate wealth for them. In their relentless quest to maximize profits, they disregard the well-being of their employees: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are subjected to grueling hours and face sudden layoffs without any severance or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in The Jungle, few, if any, laws safeguarded workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to impose harsh working conditions and accelerate production. While the narrative does not explicitly state it, those laboring in Packingtown were expected to endure these dire circumstances both at work and at home. At the time, no organizations existed to provide support or guidance to the laborers. Although unions were established, they often exploited the workers rather than aiding them, exacerbating their plight. The workers, trapped in an oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" stands as one of Edgar Allan Poe’s own acclaimed poems. Within this work, Poe references “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56, a term that Mabbott links to Virgil, who mentioned it as an island located north of Britain, believed by the Greeks to be the world's boundary. Although Virgil indeed used the term, there exists a more contemporary source deserving recognition. Poe held a keen interest in German writers.\n\nThis reference is crucial as it highlights Poe's awareness of Goethe's literature. Karl J. Arndt, in his study \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes parallels between their poems, suggesting Poe might have been influenced by Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a celebrated poet and playwright, known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within \"Faust's\" second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates a king’s grief following his wife's death, symbolized by a goblet she gifted him. Consumed by sorrow, he drinks excessively, ultimately deciding to end his life. He bequeaths his possessions to his children, except the goblet, which he casts into the sea from a cliff before closing his eyes forever. The king’s portrayal in \"The King of Thulé\" bears a resemblance to the depiction in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe’s own struggles and reliance on alcohol. \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe incorporated \"Thule\" in “The Pit and the Pendulum.”\n\nPoe refers to Thule on two occasions in his works. He mentions “ultima Thule” in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses it twice in “Dream-Land,” framing the poem. The two pieces, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" can be interpreted as companions. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule’s landscape as dark and desolate, haunted by memories of deceased friends, and enveloped in a colorless shade. These elements resonate with Goethe’s “The King of Thule,” where the protagonist mourns his wife’s loss, feeling isolated and devoid of purpose to rule or live. The poem reads as if the speaker has entered into Goethe’s narrative.\n\nGoethe was an influential figure, one Poe would likely have been familiar with, if only for his admiration of Tennyson. When asked about Tennyson, Poe spoke highly of him. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe’s work through the numerous reproductions that followed its initial publication.",
            "In the state of California, is it possible for a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to receive punitive damages by proving the store manager acted maliciously because he was twice informed of the spill but neglected to clean it for thirty minutes as he was having dinner? A judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from those actions, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the likely harm from ignoring the spill, as multiple D&D customers had been injured in similar incidents in the months before Palmer's mishap; yet despite this awareness, he did not ensure the spill was addressed. Although Palmer’s assertion that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it still holds weight given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin did not take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, around 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and didn’t have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin about the spill, to which he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm on that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and the decision on whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim is under consideration.\n\nIn California, punitive damages may be recovered for a breach of an obligation not stemming from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined by the statute as conduct intended to cause harm, or in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and carried out with \"a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others,\" as stated in § (c)(1). Courts have described actions as malicious when done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and willfully and deliberately failed to avert those consequences,\" as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Ever since she could remember, there was always an emptiness within her, a longing that seemed insatiable. This feeling began to manifest when she was around 14, just stepping into the world of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling persisted. By then, she realized she was yearning for someone, not something. Despite this realization, no boys sparked her interest. Some boys had shown interest in her, trying awkwardly to win over someone who seemed unattainable, but none captured her attention. She frequently pondered this unusual predicament, questioning why a teenage girl like her would feel this way. Years of reflection yielded various theories, but none she found convincing enough to dwell on. Thus, she continued her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nDays at home were usually serene. Her parents were gentle and composed individuals. They rarely argued with each other and seldom with their daughter. Their only disputes revolved around her asserting her independence and vibrant personality. Despite being the child of such tranquil parents, she contrasted their calm demeanor with her lively and engaging nature, which made her quite likable, complemented by her kind-heartedness.\n\nToday, however, was anything but calm. As she moved from one room to another, seeking new inspiration, a sudden scream echoed from the kitchen, her mother's lovely voice. Panic-stricken, she dashed to the kitchen, her heart racing as she asked anxiously, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" There she found her mother on the floor, clearly in distress, repeatedly whispering \"Ow\" in short, labored breaths. She rushed to her mother's side, placing a reassuring hand on her. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother's words were hurried and strained, and it was clear she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help you.\" Guided by her mother, she was grateful for the strength she had gained from her physical training. She carefully carried her mother to the car, laid her down in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scent of disinfectant and an air of anxiety. But she hardly noticed, her mind solely focused on her mother's well-being. She swiftly brought her mother inside, calling out for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a gurney to lay her mother on.

            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality due to stroke. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet and is marked by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in place of saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. The diet also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of CVD or diabetes, were monitored as part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year span. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Instances of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, these were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified as such. For each FFQ, calculations were made for body mass index, smoking status, use of aspirin, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and more accurately reflect long-term dietary consumption, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from the two preceding years. Adjustments for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) were made by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke categories.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2,391 incident cases of CHD, 1,763 incident cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "A sign declares that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone at a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this unsettling message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country witnessed a series of street protests, the first in a decade. These demonstrations, led by numerous Burmese monks, were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the Burmese government tolerated these peaceful gatherings, but as public interest grew, the situation deteriorated into a violent conflict between the monks and the military junta. The military began raiding monasteries across the nation. Foreign journalists were arrested on the spot, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, merely for covering a protest. Official reports claim 13 deaths, but Colonel Hla Win, who recently defected, suggested that fatalities were in the thousands.\n\nSuch events are not unprecedented. Governments have long sought to suppress dissent to maintain absolute control over their people. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their authority over all societal aspects. Japanese emperors were viewed as deities, meant to guide their people to success. Meanwhile, then U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly held regular calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, linked to the Republic Party.\n\nSome notorious examples include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students rallied against the government's authoritarianism. Death toll estimates from these protests vary widely, from 200-300 according to official Chinese reports to 2,000-3,000 as per the Chinese Red Cross. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militias, supported by the government, systematically exterminating Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, where Jews were systematically persecuted and killed across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz can be largely attributed to his extensive career and his exceptional skill in shaping his orchestra's sound. While his piano contributions are often understated in many of the pieces considered for this assignment, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his ability to craft intricate and layered compositions that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He created a structure that allowed soloists the freedom to improvise, while also composing tightly orchestrated pieces that leveraged the distinctive styles of his musicians to bring musical concepts to life. This approach not only spotlighted individual musicians but also enhanced the overall tone of the orchestra, resulting in cohesive and inventive soundscapes tailored to each composition. Ellington's adeptness at understanding both individual and collective sound within his ensemble enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nIn its discussion of Ellington's sound and innovative approach, the Grove Music dictionary cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's technique of using voice to add depth and color, unencumbered by lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. As a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece, it unfolds over six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Engages in a call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, then shifting to a coarser tone by the end.\nChorus 2: Features a muted trumpet solo that expands on the main melody, highlighting several elongated blue notes.\nChorus 3: Presents a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtly syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The entire band echoes the first chorus with call and response from the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: Acts as the climactic point, with reeds initiating a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with voice and reeds engaging in call and response. Here, the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, functioning as an instrumental solo.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending from a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add tonal dimension to this piece exemplifies a hallmark of his style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington marries his gift for precise orchestration with his sensitivity to tonal color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal quality of Miley's trumpet with Cox's instrumental-like voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, with Ellington employing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a fixture in his orchestra, to great effect as he introduces the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "What drives the evolutionary paths of organisms? Are there limitations or constraints that steer the course of evolutionary transformations? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” and this observation still holds true today. In more recent times, researchers have applied mathematical modeling to study the general patterns of mollusk skeletogenesis through both their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research focuses on how mathematical modeling of changes during the development and evolutionary history of Prunum, along with experimental studies, can illuminate the processes that determine the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be employed to simulate both theoretical and real skeletal structures. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of theoretical shell forms to explore the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be imagined as a structure that moves through a 360-degree space over time. These rotations or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which are envisioned as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the core of the shell and is termed the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can differ, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The “standard” orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex directed upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls is outlined below. First, the shell is viewed from the apical perspective to determine where the initial suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted starting from this line and are measured to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures that progress through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. It is feasible to trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has experienced little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the nation is progressing well towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, including those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health remain insufficient to reach the 2015 targets. The underlying reasons for these gaps will be explored below, highlighting the necessity of enhancing the health system over isolated programmatic solutions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now falling into this category. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who may lack the ability to handle complicated pregnancies (which contributes to the high incidence of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). Thus, the apparent progress in this area is somewhat misleading, and significant improvements are still needed. Additionally, there has been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea receiving treatment from a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is not comprehensive, it is evident that this remains a critical issue, with low service rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain unexpectedly low at around 4%. This statistic also highlights a concerning issue of disparity. While the c-section rate is 7% in urban areas, it drops to merely 2% in rural regions, indicating unequal healthcare access across the country. Access issues are also evident in terms of vertical equity, with a 27% difference in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. The poorer segments of society face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAs we consider steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can service deficiencies be most effectively tackled? Specifically, should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific strategies or work towards reinforcing the overall health system without concentrating solely on maternal and child care before and after pregnancy? While programmatic solutions for the outlined issues are appealing due to their focused and manageable goals, which typically yield quicker results, there are potential drawbacks. A significant downside is that prioritizing a specific health sector can lead to diminished funding for others, drawing human resources away (a scenario seen with the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on the family planning sector). Moreover, operating several parallel programs for a single area can result in service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing paperwork and supply requisition challenges.",
            "Over the last century, the categorization of popular music has evolved to include an overwhelming number of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all comprehensively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, among others—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and further subdivisions. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness lies in its ability to convey a broad spectrum of emotions, typically leaning towards the darker end. Its diversity became apparent shortly after the genre emerged, as enthusiasts recognized its adaptability and began experimenting to create new sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that persists to this day.\n\nAt present, the heavy metal movement has reached a stage where the abundance of niche groups makes defining heavy metal itself a challenge. Despite incorporating numerous elements from other genres, heavy metal, like all music, has its origins. To truly grasp the essence of today's metal music, one must first comprehend the metal movement and why it is perceived as a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal represents a movement characterized by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. With less primitivism and more technical prowess, musicians in metal bands demonstrate notable instrumental skill, evident in their music. Metal is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement heavily influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug wave of the mid-1970s led people to experiment with wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a creative catalyst. It embodies many dark, visceral elements, a stark contrast to the lighter qualities prevalent in much of popular music. Furthermore, later metal generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, intense characteristics prevalent in the Romantic Era, with lyrics that reflect the movement's inherent darkness.\n\nAn example is found in the lyrics of \"Helter Skelter,\" which reveal the darker side of the Beatles. The song portrays an erratic journey, often interpreted as drug-induced. Considered by some as one of the inaugural Heavy Metal songs, it was a reaction to a Rolling Stones track with a similarly heavy, dark tone. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their capacity to match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include this song on The White Album.",
            "Some years prior to the emergence of Surrealist painters and their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own visions, both in reality and imagination. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the enchanting landscape of her dream, but also encapsulates Rousseau’s personal aspirations and challenges as an artist. From the onset of his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers and art enthusiasts. This pursuit led to a profound internal conflict: should he imitate prevalent artistic styles to gain acceptance within the critical art community he cherished, or should he chart his own course, embracing a unique creative expression? \n\nTo appreciate The Dream through this lens, it is essential to understand Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a modest lifestyle (Shattuck 47). Lacking formal artistic education, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty, despite being mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector or douanier (Shattuck 46). After the tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving him with only one surviving daughter, Julia, Rousseau sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start (Shattuck 49). Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized rural life, Rousseau remained a folk painter, reflecting the ambitions and dreams typical of his social class.\n\nRousseau’s preoccupation with gaining acceptance in the art world is understandable when considering his background: he was self-taught, started his artistic career later in life, and was creating alongside many renowned modern artists. Despite years of dedication, Rousseau only began receiving recognition around the same time as Matisse, who was establishing his artistic reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that while Rousseau and Matisse were artistic rivals, they differed in their approach and motivation: “Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, whereas Rousseau longed to create art so conventional it would secure him a place with the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Numerous intellectuals have speculated about the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I think there's a fundamental reason for this connection. John Keats, in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we understand in life comes through education or personal experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics without needing explicit teaching. Both fields aim more to describe than to prescribe. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why an artwork or piece of literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, instead of laying out rules for determining or creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nCritiques of art or morals often fall short of capturing the true essence of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully explain why it is considered great art. When people are asked about their favorite artwork or literature, they often start with something like, \"There's just something about it,\" before offering a more detailed or critical analysis. I believe both art and morals cannot be wholly reduced to descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a piece of literature, there's something beyond that remains. I think ethics shares this feature. Wittgenstein remarks, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this \"something,\" this indescribable quality, is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and it's this transcendental characteristic that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a profound, almost ineffable level. They touch us in ways that can be felt but not fully articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean comments, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a diverse tapestry of culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the coastal city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. This cultural richness is evident from Cologne on the Rhine River, through Germany's heartland, reaching the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It is unsurprising that contemporary Germany is a product of various origins and tribes, given its unique cultural heritage.\n\nThe land historically known as Germania is the ancestral home of the Germans, though the origins of its name are debated among academics. Tacitus suggested that it originated from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he described conflicts with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine with questionable intentions. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. Some scholars speculate that the name may refer to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In his commentary on the wars, Caesar noted, “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Other theories suggest the name might derive from the weapon they used, a spear known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" reflecting the Germans' boisterous nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, the Roman historian Tacitus described the origins of the Germans: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWhy would anyone abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They occasionally launched campaigns into Germania for resources but generally returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they settled at the edges of the Roman Empire, trading goods and offering their skills as soldiers within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the theme of disguise plays a critical role, suggesting that while it can effectively sustain deception for extended periods, ultimately, individuals must abandon these false identities to avoid losing their true selves. A significant challenge in ending such a deception is the potential alienation that may follow. Therefore, one faces a choice between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. Some might respond indifferently to being deceived, while others may feel deeply offended by the ruse.\n\nThe issue of deception is particularly complex when it involves gender role reversal, raising questions such as why someone would feel compelled to abandon their identity and assume the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola's situation, her disguise serves as a protective measure: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola adopts a male persona to safeguard herself against potential threats. Her strategy succeeds, but it also distances her from the women who could have supported her. Complicating matters further, Olivia, mistaking Viola for Sebastian, falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary readers, Twelfth Night might be viewed as a narrative exploring how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for characters like Olivia and Orsino. Certain parts of the play suggest that these characters confront subconscious feelings prompted by Viola/Cesario's presence. For instance, Olivia's attraction to Cesario raises the question of whether she is drawn to the perceived masculinity or if she harbors latent feelings for women. However, it is more plausible that Shakespeare intended Olivia to satirize those of his era who judge others based solely on appearances. This is supported by how easily Olivia transfers her affections to Sebastian and starts viewing Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Observers have often highlighted the harshness of German colonial rule, particularly regarding the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. While such a generalization cannot fully capture the complexity of an entire colonial empire, it is important to recognize that the German colonial territories differed widely in terms of policies and governance styles, reflecting their geographic diversity. Similarly, educational initiatives varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in places like Kamerun and other colonies were acknowledged positively by contemporary writers.\n\nThe circumstances in South West Africa (now Namibia) were markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government was proactive in establishing state schools and significantly involved in the education of the local population, in South West Africa, educational responsibilities for the native inhabitants were largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. Conversely, substantial resources were allocated to the education of Europeans in the colony, with the establishment of state schools and increased support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies had notable numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this distinct experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on recent research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is an abundance of literature specifically addressing education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works are in German, written during or shortly after the period of German colonial dominance. Early writings primarily sought to outline the characteristics of educational systems in these territories. Subsequent English-language studies expanded the analysis through comparative examinations of education across different German colonies and more in-depth evaluations of specific educational elements. These studies highlighted notable disparities in educational systems among various colonies. The most significant work addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s analysis of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors that led to their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nRelative to Germany’s other colonial territories, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, though much of the land is arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable living conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an illustration of two countries that once experienced a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 marked the peak of this conflict, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, finally subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes between Americans and Mexicans over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31). \n\nThis scenario is similar to many other countries that maintain an enduring rivalry with a neighboring nation. Countries sharing borders often encounter conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are comparable to other long-standing rivalries between nations with shared borders. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally enjoyed amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a division between the United States and Mexico, a challenge that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) mentions that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly an ideological struggle and partly a competition over crucial interests, the U.S.-Mexico ideological tensions were rooted in religious preferences. This mistrust stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, and these inherited feelings posed a significant hurdle in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, involved territorial issues related to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations exerted military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) points out that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109), eventually concluding as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen illness left me suddenly disabled, a condition I had never encountered before.\n\nAt that time, I was working as a nurse. I had chosen this career path driven by a profound need for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. \"Nursing will always provide job opportunities; people will always need healthcare,\" was the advice I repeatedly heard as I grew up. Although my true aspirations were to become a scientist or a journalist—or ideally a blend of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, with no financial savings to rely on, and unable to work. Even now, after 15 years of depending on Social Security Disability, I have very little that I can call my own. Every day remains a challenge, continuously undermining my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty defines my life, yet one thing remains clear: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends, regardless of my inner strength. When true disaster hits, any sense of strength quickly diminishes.\n\nThe reality is that life is filled with both major and minor emergencies. No amount of preparation can guarantee a smooth path; some challenges are simply too immense to tackle alone.\n\nI fully agree that we in the U.S. should not rely solely on the government, whose systems are deteriorating. I would prefer to see Americans rediscovering trust in each other—learning to offer and accept help—rather than each of us building isolated defenses.\n\nConservative rhetoric often praises \"rugged individualism\" as a cornerstone of American history. However, the truth is that our ancestors endured hardships through compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. Pioneers who ventured across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't succeed by going it alone.\n\nTherefore, while it’s important to be prepared—I am, with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned food—it's equally crucial to connect with your neighbors.\n\nIf you have the means to cultivate a small farm or preserve your own food, it's a wise choice. A wood stove is also advantageous, provided you don’t live in an apartment.\n\nYet, as you take these steps, make an effort to get to know those around you.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, later known as Buddha, was born. Throughout his lifetime, he chose to leave worldly life behind and reached enlightenment, which gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. With a history spanning about 2,500 years, Buddhism has evolved and looks quite distinct from what it was during Buddha’s time. This evolution is evident, for example, in Sri Lanka—a Theravada Buddhist country—where an annual water-cutting ceremony is held. This event involves both monks and laypeople and holds religious significance, even though Buddha did not mention such festivities. These changes range from surface-level traditions to the deep soteriological essence of the faith. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monks and lay followers, has adapted its doctrinal principles due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, and both positive and negative.\n\nSeveral key terms will be used frequently in this discussion. The distinction between internal and external forces is crucial. Internal forces are those arising from members within the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm or disrupt the Buddhist community, stemming from negative views of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community, though their impact may inadvertently be beneficial or detrimental. These concepts will be referenced throughout the discussion.\n\nTo start with, it is essential to explore the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka includes the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering of life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth. Upon enlightenment, Sansara ceases, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more strict rules. The four noble truths are central to Buddhism: first, the truth of Dukkha, that life is suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced.

It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation, the influence of culture is profound. Culture is often understood by what it isn't, as much as by what it is and what it represents. It doesn't conform to a single mold, nor can it be pinned down to a specific entity. It's neither singular nor uniform. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are inherently general and overly reductive. While grasping cultural generalizations can be useful, it is far more beneficial for a negotiator to comprehend the relevance of culture to the issue at hand and how that culture's perspective might influence the negotiation process. When encountering a foreign culture, one interprets it relative to their own, naturally drawing comparisons.\n\nUnderstanding another culture or mindset can involve a range of activities, from exploring its historical context to recognizing its biases. Instead of passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one should embrace it as it is and operate within its confines, particularly in negotiations, and especially when in a less advantageous bargaining position. Similarly, if negotiating on foreign ground, showing respect for local customs and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and advance discussions.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that culture isn't confined to national or international distinctions. Many businesses within a nation cultivate their own unique corporate culture. For example, some corporate cultures may prioritize extended office hours, while others may adopt a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture can be observed in dress codes, communication styles (whether direct or indirect), and hiring practices. Some organizations promote philanthropy at all employee levels, while others limit it to specific \"company-approved\" initiatives. Examining the variations in American corporate culture across different companies (and even within regions or between urban and suburban settings) highlights the diversity of perspectives within a societal culture. While some cultures may appear less stratified than American culture and seem more uniform to outsiders, this similarity is merely an invitation to delve deeper.\n\nUnderstanding values is even more critical, as they reveal the reasoning behind a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior to achieve success in negotiations. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes hard bargaining will not necessarily rush to settle. Considering these generalities is crucial before entering negotiations. However, it is advantageous for a negotiator to personally understand their counterpart to make the negotiation truly effective.",
            "The phrase \"The fool has said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible and serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's discourse on God's existence. This perspective seems to be shared by Thomas Aquinas, the other thinker we are examining. Since both philosophers argue for the existence of the same deity, our task is to assess which argument is more compelling. For the sake of efficiency, we will assume they both are correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. If we were to consider a different kind of deity, it would not allow for a fair comparison of their arguments, as both focus on defending a particular understanding of God. With that in mind, I propose that while both philosophers offer important insights, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for believing in God.\n\nTo clarify this point, let's first explore St. Anselm's fundamental argument. His approach involves attaining knowledge through faith, encouraging individuals to seek evidence of God within themselves. Anselm argues that since God exists in our understanding, we cannot genuinely imagine His absence. Although his terminology can be intricate and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the proof of God's existence is found within our minds. Anselm implies that we need not look beyond our inner selves to discover the truth about God, as His existence is validated by examining our inherent understanding. This acceptance of concepts without irrefutable empirical evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian doctrine.\n\nThis notion contrasts sharply with that of St. Thomas Aquinas, who believes that God's existence can be entirely demonstrated through logic and empirical evidence, negating the necessity of faith. This approach would be advantageous for evangelism, a critical aspect of Christianity, as it allows for persuading potential converts through reason alone, independent of their readiness to accept unprovable beliefs. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each case, he essentially argues that God's existence is a logical necessity. For instance, if informed that a puzzle piece is missing, one can deduce the existence and features of that piece through logic, even without seeing it.",
            "Authors often employ a range of strategies to evoke specific emotions or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes numerous such techniques. At times, Fitzgerald combines an unexpected adjective with a noun to create a distinctive atmosphere surrounding a subject. Alternatively, he may assign symbolic meaning to an object for the same purpose. One prominent method he employs involves the use of color symbolism, particularly with hues like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors, notably white/gray and red/pink, with particular significance, subsequently using these associations to evoke certain feelings in readers about key elements.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the symbolism of white/gray as representing uniformity, with white suggesting a touch of elegance and class, while gray denotes something more aged and faded. This symbolism is introduced early on through repeated mentions of these colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as being \"in white\" (8), and white attire is a common theme: Nick sports \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom dons a \"white shirt\" (36) when meeting Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only notable deviation occurs when Nick describes Gatsby's party, noting that \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further clarifies the significance of these colors by applying them to mundane subjects: Nick travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56), the guest list at Gatsby's parties features \"gray names\" (61), and Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a metaphor for uniformity (28). Ordinary people and places are often depicted in shades of white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has firmly established the meaning of white/gray, he uses these colors to denote insignificance or uniformity in certain contexts. This use of color symbolism is first evident with Daisy. After a period with minimal mention of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster,\" leading readers to perceive her as less of an individual character and more of a uniform symbol, something Gatsby desires and yearns for (74). Fitzgerald continues to apply this technique around Daisy to reinforce the impression of her as a uniform element, as seen in references to the \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress preceding the confrontation between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County boasts a highly productive agricultural sector, largely due to its mild and sunny weather. The region is known for cultivating a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries, honey, and peppers are also commonly grown. A strong demand exists for organic, community-supported agricultural produce in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations maintaining extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are similarly sought after. Several organic farms offer tours of their agricultural practices and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. These operations enable landowners to benefit from government programs, enhance habitats, and create avenues for farm tours and educational initiatives.  \nOrganic farming can tap into a profitable niche market while also enhancing biodiversity in local plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemical usage in the soil and water. Nonetheless, organic agriculture can be more costly compared to conventional farming. It demands more labor and management to eliminate pests and weeds and enrich the soil without chemicals, often resulting in higher losses than conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms lack the economies of scale that larger operations enjoy. Activities unrelated to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and managing plant growth to create habitats, can also increase labor costs. This is why a landowner in this case might look for financial assistance or expertise to maximize profitability while maintaining high habitat quality.  \nThe land selected for this example is located near Potrero, in the unincorporated part of San Diego County, California. It spans 160 acres and includes chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan, which is under review, considers over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Others, like burrowing owls, are declining and may soon be listed.  \nThis region was historically inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers settled there in the late 1800s. This parcel of land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing or wood production over the decades.  \nI selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to explore what realistic options a small farmer might have for reducing costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations. To model what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I identified an organic farm in the same vicinity.",
            "The connection between brothers is a powerful, indelible tie. This relationship encompasses various emotions such as love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers share a unique understanding, deeper than any other bond, often seeing their own reflection in each other. The true essence of this bond reveals itself in moments of adversity, whether it manifests in a positive or negative light. These emotions, when laid bare, come with significant repercussions. Grasping the feelings that arise from this brotherly connection also involves reckoning with their resulting outcomes. When one brother meets the gaze of another and perceives his own image, he sees not the person others do, but his authentic self. It is in their behaviors and the outcomes of those behaviors that their genuine character is revealed. In “The Scarlet Ibis,” this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers and the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a richly detailed environment, these boys embark on a journey destined for failure. Intense pride clashes with bitter disappointment in a dramatic climax, leaving only one brother alive. The theme is depicted through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, their interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex emotions and worldview that greatly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are motivated by one dominant emotion: pride. From his first outing with his younger brother, Doodle, to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother he could teach skills like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He desired a companion for races to Horsehead Landing or to sit with at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, these aspirations were unattainable due to Doodle's fragile heart condition, which made survival uncertain and vigorous activity nearly impossible. For the young protagonist, whose mind was filled with grand dreams, this reality was devastating. He even admits to feeling anger towards Doodle at times, recalling a moment when he considered smothering him with a pillow. What kind of child would entertain thoughts of such a drastic action? Yet, his resolve falters when Doodle smiles at him, a simple gesture that instills hope in the protagonist, suggesting his commitment was never truly strong. An innate love for his brother lingered in his heart.",
            "The human brain is an intricate and innovative system for processing information. As technology has evolved from its rudimentary stages to the contemporary era, the metaphors describing the brain have similarly progressed. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, and a book, it is now often compared to a computer. However, when studying the brain, it is important to remember that these metaphors have their limitations and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe process of handling information begins with the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. This sensory data is continuously transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing a picture of a black box on a white backdrop, bottom-up processing assembles basic details such as color, orientation, and the object's boundaries—where the color noticeably shifts over a brief distance—to conclude that a box is being observed. Top-down processing utilizes decisions from earlier stages of bottom-up processing to hasten the recognition of the box, aiding in identifying it as a black box instead of a hole in the white background.\n\nAs information undergoes processing, an attention filter determines the significance of the signal and which cognitive processes it should be directed towards. While the brain processes every blade of grass when you glance at your shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures they aren't individually noticeable. Conversely, you might distinctly hear your name in a noisy room. Processing occurs in numerous stages, with attention repeatedly modulating the results.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first store it. Memory exists in several forms, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with each type of sensory stimulus having specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal inputs can be encoded based on their appearance, sound, or meaning. After storage, information needs to be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which retains information for about 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short time. Long-term memory is thought to be sustained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, some drawing from human memory retrieval patterns, others from computer science, and still others from neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that there are nodes representing concepts, connected based on their relationships. For instance, in a semantic network, “chair” might link to “table,” which could connect to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Back in 2007, the U.S. found itself grappling with a severe financial crisis that had far-reaching impacts. There were significant spikes in unemployment rates, the housing market collapsed, and many of the nation's major corporations faced devastation. The recession lingers on, prompting us to question the origins of this crisis and consider potential solutions. At its core, the financial turmoil was a result of imprudent political choices that encouraged financial institutions to issue risky sub-prime loans within an underdeveloped economic framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were compelled to support and transform these loans into complex financial products. As borrowers began to default, banks lacked sufficient capital reserves and the repercussions spread through the economy.\n\nThe origins of the crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration, as the President sought to bolster his chances for reelection. The strategy involved loosening lending regulations to gain favor among the populace, inadvertently laying the groundwork for the sub-prime mortgage disaster that would unfold seven years later. A 1999 report by Steven Holmes in the New York Times highlighted the pressures faced by Fannie Mae to increase lending to lower-income groups, driven by both the administration's push and shareholder expectations for profit growth. Holmes presciently warned of potential issues during economic downturns, suggesting a possible government bailout reminiscent of the 1980s savings and loan crisis.\n\nSeveral elements contributed to the economic downturn, not least of which were the complex mortgage structures that became prevalent. The widespread use of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations entangled various economic sectors with the housing market, leading to excessive leverage and heightened vulnerability to price fluctuations. When the housing bubble finally burst, financial entities holding these securities suffered significant losses. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, representing nearly a third of the country's GDP. This led to the sale of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch at significantly reduced prices, the disbandment of Lehman Brothers, and the transformation of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government oversight by September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition—a section of your narrative where you spread your creative wings and soar, captivating everyone with your enchanting, if not mesmerizing, prose. Alternatively, it might be where your audience dozes off or clicks away, lamenting your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to express frustration at her screen when overwhelmed by an excess of information, and not in a delightful manner.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are familiar with the writing adage, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. Merlin still finds herself entangled in lengthy passages where nothing unfolds, or worse, too much does. Exposition is that mischievous spirit whispering in your ear to clear the historical clutter before getting to the exciting parts (not to be mistaken with the other spirit urging you to share every single detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition entails narrating events to the audience, often using straightforward language. In cinema, exposition occurs when a character reveals a bulk of information to another, reminiscent of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it is the author who does the narrating.\n\nAn illustration is warranted. As you explore a story, you are informed that the heroine encountered her beloved at a specific place and time, they married in a grand ceremony, and her husband was tragically murdered before her eyes. You would not anticipate this entire sequence to span two pages, with both characters receiving only two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to invest time in developing the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior the depth of his love for his wife. Similarly, you would expect the heroine to exhibit, in various ways, how his presence transformed and enriched her life (especially if the narrative later states that this was indeed the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would foster emotional investment in his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she admired in him, the depth of their connection, insights into her thoughts, beliefs, and aspirations as mirrored in his eyes, and so forth. You would grieve his loss alongside her, thereby deepening your connection to the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you would anticipate substance on the simple outline of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's your duty to provide that substance. (*examines metaphor, sighs, ventures forward*) It can be tempting to gloss over certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, aware that he once served in the Air Force, is now the night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was a \"live\" segment on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The leading story was about a man from Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife; her name wasn't mentioned, but his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot, and he appeared quite sinister. They only spent about two minutes on this story since it was still unfolding. The details provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I felt they allocated a suitable amount of time to this news.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting involving Travis Buyers, 18, who was critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. At that time, no arrests had been made, nor were there any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the incident. This story seemed brief, and I suspect it might be because it involved a \"black\" man or occurred in a predominantly black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention. If a \"white\" child or adult is kidnapped, missing, or a victim of a crime, the media usually provides extensive coverage; however, if a minority is involved, it's rare for it to be mentioned.\n\nThe following story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about where they believed the incident took place. It was determined that a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle struck the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers is offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next segment was about the forecasted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The segment was brief, likely to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nAdditionally, there was a report about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie. They mentioned he was about six feet tall and weighed around one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they placed an unusual emphasis on his race and complexion.\n\nAnother story featured Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Interestingly, instead of saying he received a twenty-five-year prison sentence, they stated \"300\" months. I am unsure of their intention, whether it was to make it sound harsher or for another reason. They also noted he was Hispanic, which I felt was unnecessary information for the story.",
            "An exchange traded fund, commonly known as an ETF, is a type of security that aims to mirror the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets similar to an index fund, yet offers greater flexibility by being traded like a stock on an exchange. An ETF combines the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of owning individual stocks, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase just a single share per transaction. Despite these appealing features, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund. However, one downside is the necessity to pay commissions on ETF trades, akin to those on stock trades. Another advantage of ETFs is the vast array of available funds. Though these benefits are highlighted, it is wise for a prudent financial investor to assess whether benefits like diversification genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will scrutinize the ETF IHF and contrast it with its top 10 holdings to see if the advantages of owning a single ETF are comparable to holding a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, and to explore if there are better configurations of these stocks for an optimal Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo assess the ETF, it becomes impractical to include every holding; thus, we have chosen to focus only on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. Here are the top 10 holdings and their respective percentage of total assets.\n\nTo estimate how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use the current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to compute each stock's contribution to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these 10 stocks in the ETF's established proportions. The calculations for Beta and return are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart indicates that a portfolio with just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top ten holdings is also .12 lower than the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with a lower beta. However, there exists a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from one another.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are statistically distinct, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is calculated and normalized to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "In looking back at Figure 17, a significant decline in commuter log submissions was noticeable by the third month of the project, which was somewhat disappointing, and the reasons for this are not entirely clear. The arrival of winter at a New England university might have contributed to fewer people commuting by bike or on foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when individuals are occupied with wrapping up academic responsibilities and grading, potentially causing the commuter log to be overlooked. The busy holiday season and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty, who often do not need to be on campus during this period, could also be factors. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might explain the low log submissions for that time. However, February's low submissions remain puzzling. It might be that projects like these naturally experience an initial surge in enthusiasm that wanes over time. To address this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign that successfully boosted log submissions for that month. Thus, maintaining project momentum was challenging, particularly due to the natural drop in engagement and the specific issue of holiday and semester breaks in higher education. Another hurdle faced by this project, and similar initiatives, is that personal car use, with its associated freedom and flexibility, is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, offering incentives for alternative commuting methods is crucial. We distributed numerous prizes, such as gift certificates to local dining establishments, coffee shops, massage services, an independent bookstore, and some larger national retailers. However, it would have been intriguing to observe how larger prizes, like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric vehicle, might have influenced participation and potentially mitigated the dip in engagement. The nature of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but increasing their value over time might have been beneficial. Initially, the gift cards were well-received, but announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles in December or a hybrid or electric car in January, could have potentially increased participation and engagement rather than seeing a decline.",
            "While exploring the early Edison films collection at the Library of Congress, I was intrigued by the category of trick films, so I decided to watch all fifteen produced between 1895 and 1901. These films are known for their use of inventive editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis centered on detailing the aesthetics of most trick films and identifying unique features in some of the later examples. Typically, trick films from this era were studio-bound, shot within a frontal proscenium, featured static cameras, relied on long and medium shots, and followed a strict one shot per film method. However, a few films at the beginning of the 20th century started to challenge these conventions by incorporating elements like multiple shots.\n\nA prominent feature shared by these trick films is their use of interior sets framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains static, not following any figures or objects. This approach, common in early cinema, has its origins in theatrical productions, as well as vaudeville and magic shows for trick films. One limitation of this stage-based setup is that actors in trick films typically move only side-to-side, avoiding movement toward or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right and move horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains stationary.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also results in predominantly long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in Edison’s trick films because, much like in theater and vaudeville, the audience sees the entire performance within the stage's frame. Therefore, the actors do not approach the camera from the middle ground, eliminating the need for close-ups.\n\nIn general, early trick films adhere to the format where one conceptual shot represents an entire film. This constraint keeps most trick films under a minute long, influenced by the frames per second used. It also limits the narrative or dramatic potential, as these films primarily focus on brief vaudeville-style acts like magic, vanishing, and transformations with minimal storytelling. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot to the audience doesn't always equate to a single physical shot. What appears as one shot may be a series of shots seamlessly combined to create illusions like appearing or disappearing. A closer look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) reveals the transition to the shot with Mary's \"head\" being severed, showcasing how, despite appearing as one continuous shot, multiple shots are used to achieve the trick.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is intriguingly a contradiction in terms, as Ian Watt elaborates in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, calling it an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New.'\" The Gothic genre has experienced mixed opinions, having been both criticized for lacking depth and celebrated for its 'terrible sublime' quality, as noted by Burke. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto is considered the first \"Gothic Novel,\" blending elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to forge the beginnings of the Gothic genre and introduce a novel form of literary expression. Walpole integrates \"old\" theatrical components with 'new' emulations of nature found in 'modern' novels, coining it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often revisits medieval gothic theater, architecture, and customs. At the time The Castle of Otranto was published, \"gothic\" was a term applied to various peoples, styles, and eras, often seen as outdated or lacking sophistication compared to \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The blend of the dramatic \"Gothic\" with the novel's format, which offers a deeper insight into characters' psyches, is what has enabled Gothic literature to endure over time, appearing both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from its initial creation.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is Chivalry. The medieval notion of chivalry, the training of a noble knight, is both preserved and altered in the first Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers due to its representation of the ideal knight—courageous, honorable, and skilled—and the perceived absence of those ideals in society, a sentiment shared by Walpole. By using chivalric ideals and behaviors, the \"gothic past\" is romanticized, hinting at the future shift from Gothic to Romantic, and is employed to critique and potentially enhance the present. When Walpole penned The Castle of Otranto, he was navigating a politically tumultuous era and was concerned about what lay ahead. Engrossed in politics and facing potentially unjust accusations, he might have begun to believe, perhaps subconsciously, that the moral integrity and intrinsic \"goodness\" of the gothic era had somehow faded from contemporary society. This notion is evident in his portrayal of several characters, notably Frederic. Before even encountering Frederic, readers learn he embodies numerous chivalric qualities; he is described as:\n\nFrederic is depicted with many traditional chivalric attributes; he is primarily a prince who has endured suffering, been profoundly impacted by tragedy, and is thought to have been slain by infidels. The depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, naturally, amplified, introducing the soon-to-be Gothic motif of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves a series of steps that facilitate the transfer of goods from the initial customer order through various stages such as raw material sourcing, supply, production, and finally distribution to the end customer. The concept of supply chain management was introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982. He defined it as the comprehensive process of planning, executing, and overseeing activities within the supply chain to efficiently meet customer demands. The supply chain comprises six critical components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nProduction marks the beginning of the supply chain. It serves as the groundwork for the entire sequence, determining the logistics of when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must grasp customer preferences, often gauged by market trends, to ascertain the demand for specific products. Upon understanding market demands, managers decide which products to produce and in what quantity. Following this, they select the most suitable production facilities, balancing volume and quality to meet customer expectations. Once production sites are established, managers turn their attention to organizing workloads and maintaining equipment. This stage is crucial as it impacts the entire supply chain process; any oversight can lead to significant time and financial losses. For instance, during my tenure at Wal-Mart and Target, I observed that both companies had detailed guidelines for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. Such structured processes help businesses operate efficiently and avoid confusion regarding procedures and expectations.\n\nThe next major component of supply chain management is supply. This involves strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and the potential for outsourcing partnerships. A single product might be produced across various divisions, each with distinct equipment, staff, and expertise. It is up to management to determine which division is best suited for different stages of production. Additionally, outsourcing may be considered to enhance velocity, which refers to the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or stable.",
            "Victorian novels often stand out due to their meticulous attention to detail and their emphasis on the period’s aristocracy. However, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, while considered Victorian, diverge from these norms. Both books incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, which are uncommon for novels of that era, thereby enhancing the depth of their characters and offering greater insight into their motivations and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the narrative frequently delves into dreamlike sequences or surreal states that vary in purpose and content. These peculiar moments often reveal layers of Oliver's inner self, his suffering, and his understanding of the realities around him. In chapter 28, when Oliver's shooting incident is revisited, he experiences it as vividly as a dream, struggling to seek assistance. This passage highlights Oliver’s lack of control over the unfolding events and his precarious health condition, vividly portrayed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. As the shooting incident consumes him, his senses become numbed, and he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that rescues him; he re-experiences despair, with pain now an ever-present companion linked more to fear than surprise. This raises questions about who is responsible for Oliver's plight, as it is certainly not by his own choice. The episode emphasizes Oliver's limited control over his life, as he cannot muster the will to influence the outcome of events, even when his life is at risk. The selection hints at Oliver’s growing sense of defeat, suggesting that Fagin's influence is breaking him, pushing him towards resignation and affecting his ability to respond, whereas otherwise, one might expect Oliver to make some effort for his own survival.\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.",
            "A few years back, I participated in an after-school program where I tutored elementary students. I aimed to assist them in any subject they found challenging, although my expertise lay in English and reading. One of the instructors asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade, and was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. It became apparent to me that something was amiss; his issues were quite unusual. He could pronounce some letters flawlessly while others were completely elusive, which was puzzling. Adrian was of Latino heritage, which was evident, yet he spoke impeccable English. We continued to face challenges until I met his mother one day. While I was supervising a few students who stayed back when the rest went on a field trip, Adrian's mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, not a word of English. Despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was during this interaction that I realized Adrian's issue: he could read well but was unfamiliar with the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this realization was beneficial for him in the long run, but I sincerely hope he has improved since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the issue of language barriers in schools, particularly here in California. It serves as a testament to the fact that these barriers aren't always as apparent as one might assume. Even children who speak flawless English might encounter significant challenges in reading it. Acknowledging this problem is easy, but addressing it is another matter. In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: targeted tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There is no singular answer. A combination of dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes is essential.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is an excellent idea. It benefits not only children whose first language is Spanish but all children. Research shows that students in two-way bilingual education programs often surpass their peers academically. Concerns exist that such programs are resource-draining and won't benefit the majority. This is a misconception. Making these programs a standard part of the curriculum, rather than an exception, would benefit all students. But how should this be implemented? Should all teachers be required to be bilingual? No, that would be impractical and somewhat unrealistic. However, we can certainly employ bilingual aides or tutors to support these efforts.",
            "From a young age, many of us are taught that there's something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some find this in Sunday school, others in Temple, or through personal introspection. Many accept the religions inherited from our parents, but some dismiss them, believing there's nothing beyond their own self-centered universe. We might embrace one belief system only to later replace it with another. Regardless of the path taken, we seek to understand a part of ourselves through our own spiritual perspectives, looking for a guiding light to lead us from darkness into clarity.\n\nWhen I asked my father about his favorite bird, he said, \"A cardinal.\" We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain drum against the tin roof as we smoked. Rainwater cascaded from the gutters, flooding the plants nearby. Dad gazed into the rain, with a look that seemed both reflective and reminiscent. He had lost weight over the past months, his clothes hanging loosely, and his hair was sparser. He continued to avoid eye contact, and I felt isolated, scared, unable to express how much I'd miss him, fearing that speaking it out loud would make it more real for us both. I hugged him, then moved my chair closer, joining him in watching the rain fall in the June evening.\n\nMy father passed away that December, five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemotherapy and radiation hadn't eased his pain, only prolonged his life beyond doctors' predictions; what was gained by extending his suffering, I couldn't understand. I questioned what kind of God would allow this. Alone in the night, I didn't pray. If God existed, I felt he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI couldn't bear to watch him transition from this life to whatever comes next. So, I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that gave me life come to an end. I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't want his only child to witness his passing. I stayed curled up in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for Republicanism in his time. While his primary occupation was in agriculture, his brief political career also shaped his reputation as a passionate and vocal defender of personal freedom and governance. His steadfast belief in an agriculture-based society influenced most of his thoughts on government affairs. He strived to protect and promote what he deemed the most noble of professions, which in turn impacted his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the formation of the United States as a unique chance to establish an exemplary system of governance, unburdened by entrenched traditions. This allowed for the creation of a self-governing framework. He was a firm believer in the natural rights of individuals, considering these rights interconnected—if one is denied, the others suffer, diminishing their worth. Thus, he argued that these rights should remain outside governmental control. He contended that what was often termed the “state of nature” favored those with physical strength and cunning, but insisted that in a civilized society, this should not be the norm.\n\nTo build this ideal society, Taylor argued for a government that acknowledges humanity's inherent virtues and vices. He held strong views on moral duality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). To him, good principles were those protecting private property, advancing agriculture, and discouraging capitalism. A government founded on such principles, he believed, would operate justly, even when led by self-interest and greed. He saw self-interest as a natural human motivation, only deemed negative when it led to societal structures exploiting others. A sound government, he believed, was essential for curbing humanity's natural malevolence and needed vigilant oversight to prevent the infusion of harmful principles.\n\nLike many steadfast Republicans of his era, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He desired a Federal government with highly limited powers, restricted to those explicitly outlined in the Constitution. He recognized that a large Federal government could become costly and tyrannical. Nonetheless, he cautioned that a mere literal interpretation could be perilous without considering the framers' intentions, as such an approach might become corrupted. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, emphasizing its depiction of the nation as a coalition of sovereign states rather than a single entity.",
            "I gazed downward, my mind struggling to fully grasp the scenery laid out before me. In a detached and quiet manner, I assessed the sight with an awareness that chose not to connect it to any abstract interpretation. Thoughts flitted in and out of my mind so swiftly that it barely felt like I was thinking at all; it was more like I was simply experiencing the scene in front of me. \n\nOnce, upon the suggestion of an artist I collaborated with, I bought an art guide titled The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Ever since I was a child of six, I had aspired to draw, and this book offered lessons on everything from understanding a pencil to how the brain perceives lines. One of its methods was to frame any picture the artist wished to study with a square. This technique transformed a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a more manageable image: just the bowl of fruit on a simple plane.\n\nIn that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't mentally apply that artist’s frame. I was overwhelmed, struck with awe, able only to stand and marvel. Picasso had a blue period, Monet cherished greenery, and Italian Renaissance artists used a spectrum of colors. If I had any ambition to view my perspective as deserving of the label Artistic, what lay before me was the inception of my creation, the start of my narrative, Work in Brown.\n\nMy fingers touched my chosen tool of creation, muscles flexing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, my mind’s intent taking shape in what could have been the most inventive moment of my life. Water swirled serenely, smooth and crystal clear. Fragments of matter detached from the whole and vanished. Muscles tensed, my hand struck the toilet handle again, more urgently. The stubborn brown parcel remained, stuck like a slug at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nWith a mop loosely held in my hand, feet planted a foot apart, and a green tie uncomfortably knotted around my neck, I frowned slightly at the offensive bundle of processed matter left as a message for those tasked with cleaning the bathrooms at Rite Aid. After a few more flushes and some serene moments of introspection, I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand slowly descended into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….",
            "Young drivers are facing significant risks on the road. Various elements contribute to the alarming statistics regarding teenage drivers in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, one issue is that adolescent brains are not fully developed to handle the challenges of driving. Additionally, lack of experience is a major factor, leading not only to more fatal crashes but also to incidents like rollovers, speeding, and veering off the road.\n\nTeenagers are particularly vulnerable when driving with friends, a situation they frequently find themselves in. Research by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center demonstrated a link between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented measures such as provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and the presence of other minors as passengers to enhance teen driver safety.\n\nHowever, I view provisional licenses as temporary fixes. The core problem is that young drivers, as a group, are statistically unprepared to manage driving risks and responsibilities effectively. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even argues that 18 years old might still be too young for a standard driver’s license. His research, highlighted by USA Today, suggests that individuals under 19-20 are often driven by a desire for thrill-seeking. It would therefore be logical to delay licensing until this behavior starts to diminish. Continuing to allow young teenagers to drive could result in increasing numbers of fatal accidents, with a potentially overwhelming death toll as more Baby Boomer offspring reach driving age by 2010.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively straightforward. Schools could maintain driver’s education programs to prepare future drivers, but individuals under 18 would not be permitted to drive. A provisional permit could still be granted before a full license, with a requirement for a certain number of practical training hours. This requirement could align with current standards in most states, such as California’s mandate of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. Given that the troubling statistics for teen drivers are consistent across states, a uniform national policy on this matter would be a sensible and potentially effective way to safeguard teenagers nationwide.\n\nThe legislative approach I propose is not a groundbreaking concept.",
            "This essay explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with a concise explanation of what the disorder entails. Following this, it delves into how CAPD is diagnosed, highlighting typical signs or \"red flags.\" The paper concludes by suggesting strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), CAPD is narrowly defined as the perceptual processing of auditory information within the CNS and the neurobiologic activities that underlie such processing, resulting in electrophysiologic auditory potentials. Essentially, this means that while individuals with CAPD can hear normally, the part of the brain tasked with interpreting sounds and distinguishing speech from background noise does not function as expected.\n\nThe origins of what is now known as CAPD trace back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers began assessing children with communicative disorders. In 1954, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing diagnostic tests for these children. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiology of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) that is involved in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A pivotal national conference in 1977 further spurred research into CAPD among children.\n\nCAPD can present itself in various forms. Individuals may struggle to locate or hear sounds spatially, differentiate between multiple sound occurrences, recognize sound patterns, or detect changes in speech, such as tone indicating sarcasm. They might experience difficulty when one sound overlaps with another, lack the ability to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful interpretations, or have trouble perceiving the order of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of listening behaviors and auditory functions, carried out by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists (SLPs), psychologists, and others. This process may include the use of questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to auditory stimuli (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool or test with a high success rate, nor is there a known cause for CAPD. Diagnostic tests often involve presenting the individual with multiple auditory stimuli simultaneously, requiring them to distinguish between specific elements, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments might involve measuring acoustic signals within the ear and observing the responses to these signals.",
            "My educational journey in social work is driven by a desire to build a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where my goal is to support children who have experienced abuse or neglect and to assist families in distress. I bring to the field values such as service, respect, ethics, and a dedication to fostering better relationships while continuously improving my professional abilities to stay effective in my work. These principles are not only fundamental to social work but are also deeply significant to me on a personal level.\n\nHelping others has always been my aspiration, though I initially struggled to identify the exact career path I wanted. During high school and college, I observed many people who avoided confronting their challenges, and some adopted poor coping strategies. These observations motivated me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still uncertain about my career direction after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took some time off. That summer, I happened to visit a friend who introduced me to a nervous sixteen-year-old boy on her couch. He was there seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had involved the police at his parents' home. Wanting to help, I went over to his parents' house to express my concerns privately to the officers, mentioning my recent Psychology degree. The police asked me to speak with the parents, as legally they couldn't intervene for the teenager. When I spoke to the parents, they were uneasy and offered excuses for their son’s behavior, labeling his actions as “manipulative” for involving others in “simple” family matters. This incident propelled me to seriously contemplate a career in social work to aid children facing such “simple” familial conflicts.\n\nSocial justice is another cornerstone of social work that holds significant importance for me. Society often emphasizes the value of the individual and mourns those we lose, yet the societal idea of the “individual” often follows outdated norms rather than true uniqueness. If society mourns individuals, why do we strive for uniformity? I cherish my individuality and resist conforming to others' standards. Throughout my time in high school and college, I consistently opposed social injustice through personal expression like unconventional hair and clothing, multiple ear piercings, active participation in the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and standing against racism and discrimination whenever I encountered it. I am committed to the cause of social justice and will persist in challenging social inequities.",
            "This essay explores both the Biological and Sociocultural frameworks as they pertain to insomnia. The Biological perspective emphasizes inherited genetic traits and medical components of health. In contrast, the Sociocultural perspective examines environmental interactions and their relevance to factors like race, ethnicity, demographic information, and socioeconomic status. This analysis of insomnia evaluates these models and delves into selected research to elucidate and enhance understanding of these frameworks. The research explanations and their outcomes are then evaluated for their distinctive strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized in various ways: as primary sleep disorders, those associated with other mental disorders, or those linked to other issues. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders tied to other mental disorders correlate with Axis I or Axis II disorders. Additional categories may stem from medical issues or substance use. Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty in achieving or maintaining sleep, whereas Primary Hypersomnia pertains to challenges in staying awake, both persisting for at least a month. Narcolepsy includes symptoms like cataplexy and/or automatic REM. While Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological irregularities during sleep. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders related to other mental disorders involve sleep issues due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Intellectual Disabilities). This analysis centers on insomnia and somewhat on primary sleep disorders more broadly, in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders highlights genetic, hereditary, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Research involving mice discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor triggers responses that facilitate sleep, and inhibiting it can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to extend sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal studies with mice may be applicable to human studies. This indicates a genetic and environmental foundation for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could hinder one's ability to achieve restful sleep without medication. From a sociocultural viewpoint, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and any modification of the receptor might naturally disrupt an individual's sleep. This could adversely affect various life aspects such as education, career, and daily tasks requiring focus and repetition.",
            "For roughly two and a half years, encompassing about four and a half semesters, I've been studying at University Park. Navigating the campus poses a challenge for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to a dorm in East Halls, practically the easternmost boundary of the campus, aside from the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Making my way from Stuart Hall to classes located in distant buildings like Willard, near the campus core, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when the weather was unfavorable, which is often the case in State College. A conversation with a slightly older alum revealed that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the main campus by vast stretches of unused land. Nowadays, that space is occupied by sports fields, massive new structures like the Creamery and the health services building, and is encircled by apartments. As the campus continues its growth, moving around becomes increasingly challenging. What could be the optimal solution for campus mobility? Bicycles are the answer. However, bikes alone won’t address the issue. Students need to ride them, and the infrastructure should accommodate cyclists’ needs.\n\nA friend of mine recently returned to cycling after several years and expressed surprise at why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he remarked, “for a while, biking wasn’t considered cool, but it’s the best way to get around.” Besides being beneficial for health, cycling is also the most efficient form of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some effort can take you over 30 miles. Like many students, I now reside off-campus, just as distant from the campus center as some dorms. Purchasing a bike has been my smartest decision this year. I have classes in the Thomas building daily, which is a good 25-minute walk from my home. With a bike, that journey can be reduced to 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The only challenge is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my place, isn’t always an easy path, whether you're biking or walking. Walking has its merits, but I’m simply too busy for it. Without my bike, I’d have no other dependable way to reach my classes. Walking to Thomas every day would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, adding up to over two and a half hours weekly. Plus, the extra walking time to other classes and appointments would demand more time than I can afford.",
            "In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley critiques the looming dangers posed by technology and the capitalist system that underpins it, constructing a dystopian society to explore these themes. Within this society, individuals prioritize collective well-being over personal identity, being conditioned from birth to seek immediate pleasure as their ultimate goal. The citizens are mere instruments in a grand scheme, confined to a singular ideology orchestrated by the World Controller. Viewing the novel through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley’s skepticism towards these developing systems. Marxist concepts such as homogeny and reification bolster the argument that Huxley's work critiques the flaws of the economic landscape emerging during his era.\n\nCapitalism is ridiculed through the Marxist idea of false consciousness, wherein ordinary people remain unaware of their true economic relationships with other classes, focusing instead on personal gain. This stems from ideological control over the working class, vividly illustrated by the conditioning of the populace in \"Brave New World.\" The lower social classes, like the Deltas and Gammas, lack genuine autonomy; through hypnopædia, they are driven to consume, spend, and indulge above all. This manipulation is overseen, as noted earlier, by the World Controller. Hegemony, the concept that certain social classes are entirely dominated by another group, is evident here. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, literally embracing an ideology that sustains the existing structure—capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes have the awareness to recognize it but largely remain passive; few Alphas or Betas, aside from characters like Bernard, challenge their roles. The interactions among social classes significantly illustrate the perceived oppression within capitalism.\n\nIn \"Brave New World,\" genuine relationships between individuals are absent. The novel intentionally blurs character distinctions, even among main characters, who lack depth. Huxley may be suggesting that the intertwining rise of technology and capitalism strips individuals of free will and self-expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent; instead, interactions are superficial, seen in the men’s comments about women focusing mainly on physical traits, like their \"pneumatic quality,\" and in the women’s candid remarks about their experiences. Moreover, the satisfaction of each social class with their position in the hierarchy reflects capitalism's socioeconomic impact. Their unwavering conformity to their roles in the community echoes Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their own superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and align with their peers.",
            "Nearly four years ago, I enrolled in an Islam course at CBC, where one of the central debates was whether Islam could be considered a hostile religion. This question seems even more pertinent now than it did back then. Reflecting on the period since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam, moving from a hostile stance against Islam and its extremists to an increased tolerance within American society. In 2001, it would have been hard to imagine a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has a family background that includes Muslim ties.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad fascinates me because, based on my understanding of his history, it seems to contradict his portrayed personality. Previously, I believed that Muhammad converted people to Islam by force, conquering tribes and compelling them to adopt the religion. However, the biography presents Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr who humbled himself, leading people to gradually recognize the 'truth' of his teachings and seek him out.\n\nInterestingly, there are notable similarities between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's 'miracles.' One striking example is when Muhammad reportedly multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of narration suggests the authors wanted to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, living in truth and performing miracles without needing to prove himself. This narrative bothers me because it seems to diminish the miracles and life of Jesus Christ, almost as if credit is being taken from Jesus and attributed to Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories aimed at providing evidence of individuals 'independently' converting to Islam. However, these accounts often appear to rely on third-party perspectives, with the narrative indicating someone heard it from someone else, and so on. While the intention might be to offer proof of these stories' authenticity, I find this approach makes the accounts seem less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is the portrayal of Muhammad as a divine figure—humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. Yet, historical accounts challenge this depiction, and I wonder if today's Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s ascent to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs that Jesus held during his lifetime quickly diverged from the path of Christian development that continued after his passing. Observing this historical progression, it becomes apparent that Christianity has gradually drifted from its origins. In today's world, there is an increasing awareness and a unique progressive trend. While some traditionalists persist and will resist any thought that extends beyond their teachings, this group may not have the influence to sway the majority. Within the Christian community, historical awareness is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a widespread desire to differentiate the doctrines that were incorporated into Christianity over time from the original intent of its founder. Though this process may take decades or even centuries, the eventual outcome seems inevitable: a significant shift back to Christianity’s original form. A growing movement will aim to peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, as if reversing the flow of time, until only the essence of what Jesus conveyed to humanity on behalf of God remains, untouched by subsequent interpretations. When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, inspiring many to worship as if they were contemporaries of Jesus, adhering solely to his teachings, the church as an institution will remain robust to guide this transition. However, as theological perspectives revert, the vast diversity within Christianity will diminish, leading to more uniform beliefs and practices. Across regions and denominations, and bridging various divisions, we will observe a shift from differences to growing similarities. Human history is replete with significant reversions. A noteworthy example is the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution. Similarly, our nation has evolved from a history of African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The impending reversion will unfold within the realm of the Christian religion, retracing history to its origins and reducing diversity along the way. It is vital to recognize that this process will be facilitated by interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically rather than literally. So, what has transpired since Jesus' time? Looking back far enough, we find Judaism as the theological foundation for Christianity. By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, the concept of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of Hebrew scriptures were central to the religion. However, the Jewish population was not uniform; it was divided among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common folk.",
            "In my view, The Jungle vividly illustrates the inherent greed and self-interest present in human nature. Individuals tend to prioritize their own welfare and strive to enhance their lives without considering those less fortunate. This theme is prominently depicted in several ways throughout the novel. A clear example is seen in the actions of the factory owners and managers, who are solely focused on expanding their businesses to the greatest extent possible. They show little concern for the obstacles or the harm they cause in their pursuit of progress. Upton Sinclair's narrative captures this disregard through imagery like \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" Sinclair aims to highlight the environmental destruction resulting from such industrial pollution, emphasizing the owners' indifference to the detrimental impact on people and animals. The toxic emissions from the factories and the waste runoff from numerous cattle pens in Packingtown exemplify this neglect.\n\nMoreover, the employers exhibit a lack of empathy towards their workforce, who toil to generate wealth for them. In their relentless quest to maximize profits, they disregard the well-being of their employees: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are subjected to grueling hours and face sudden layoffs without any severance or assistance in finding new employment. During the period depicted in The Jungle, few, if any, laws safeguarded workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to impose harsh working conditions and accelerate production. While the narrative does not explicitly state it, those laboring in Packingtown were expected to endure these dire circumstances both at work and at home. At the time, no organizations existed to provide support or guidance to the laborers. Although unions were established, they often exploited the workers rather than aiding them, exacerbating their plight. The workers, trapped in an oppressive system, were likened to slaves: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\"Dream-Land\" stands as one of Edgar Allan Poe’s own acclaimed poems. Within this work, Poe references “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56, a term that Mabbott links to Virgil, who mentioned it as an island located north of Britain, believed by the Greeks to be the world's boundary. Although Virgil indeed used the term, there exists a more contemporary source deserving recognition. Poe held a keen interest in German writers.\n\nThis reference is crucial as it highlights Poe's awareness of Goethe's literature. Karl J. Arndt, in his study \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" observes parallels between their poems, suggesting Poe might have been influenced by Goethe.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a celebrated poet and playwright, known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" released in two parts, first in 1808 and the second coinciding with Goethe's death in 1832. Within \"Faust's\" second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem narrates a king’s grief following his wife's death, symbolized by a goblet she gifted him. Consumed by sorrow, he drinks excessively, ultimately deciding to end his life. He bequeaths his possessions to his children, except the goblet, which he casts into the sea from a cliff before closing his eyes forever. The king’s portrayal in \"The King of Thulé\" bears a resemblance to the depiction in \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe’s own struggles and reliance on alcohol. \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, a mere year before Poe incorporated \"Thule\" in “The Pit and the Pendulum.”\n\nPoe refers to Thule on two occasions in his works. He mentions “ultima Thule” in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses it twice in “Dream-Land,” framing the poem. The two pieces, \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" can be interpreted as companions. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule’s landscape as dark and desolate, haunted by memories of deceased friends, and enveloped in a colorless shade. These elements resonate with Goethe’s “The King of Thule,” where the protagonist mourns his wife’s loss, feeling isolated and devoid of purpose to rule or live. The poem reads as if the speaker has entered into Goethe’s narrative.\n\nGoethe was an influential figure, one Poe would likely have been familiar with, if only for his admiration of Tennyson. When asked about Tennyson, Poe spoke highly of him. Beyond the Tennyson connection, Poe would have encountered Goethe’s work through the numerous reproductions that followed its initial publication.",
            "In the state of California, is it possible for a customer who was hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to receive punitive damages by proving the store manager acted maliciously because he was twice informed of the spill but neglected to clean it for thirty minutes as he was having dinner? A judge might not immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To justify such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm resulting from those actions, and that the behavior was despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the likely harm from ignoring the spill, as multiple D&D customers had been injured in similar incidents in the months before Palmer's mishap; yet despite this awareness, he did not ensure the spill was addressed. Although Palmer’s assertion that Martin's actions were despicable is less compelling, it still holds weight given that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin did not take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, around 5:00 pm, D&D Markets employee Rich Wayne informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in one of the aisles. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and didn’t have time for customer complaints. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin about the spill, to which he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm on that day, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill and suffered a severe back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages for her injury, and the decision on whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim is under consideration.\n\nIn California, punitive damages may be recovered for a breach of an obligation not stemming from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" according to Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined by the statute as conduct intended to cause harm, or in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and carried out with \"a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others,\" as stated in § (c)(1). Courts have described actions as malicious when done with conscious disregard for the plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and willfully and deliberately failed to avert those consequences,\" as noted in Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Ever since she could remember, there was always an emptiness within her, a longing that seemed insatiable. This feeling began to manifest when she was around 14, just stepping into the world of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling persisted. By then, she realized she was yearning for someone, not something. Despite this realization, no boys sparked her interest. Some boys had shown interest in her, trying awkwardly to win over someone who seemed unattainable, but none captured her attention. She frequently pondered this unusual predicament, questioning why a teenage girl like her would feel this way. Years of reflection yielded various theories, but none she found convincing enough to dwell on. Thus, she continued her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nDays at home were usually serene. Her parents were gentle and composed individuals. They rarely argued with each other and seldom with their daughter. Their only disputes revolved around her asserting her independence and vibrant personality. Despite being the child of such tranquil parents, she contrasted their calm demeanor with her lively and engaging nature, which made her quite likable, complemented by her kind-heartedness.\n\nToday, however, was anything but calm. As she moved from one room to another, seeking new inspiration, a sudden scream echoed from the kitchen, her mother's lovely voice. Panic-stricken, she dashed to the kitchen, her heart racing as she asked anxiously, \"Mom?! Mom, what's happening?!\" There she found her mother on the floor, clearly in distress, repeatedly whispering \"Ow\" in short, labored breaths. She rushed to her mother's side, placing a reassuring hand on her. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" Her mother's words were hurried and strained, and it was clear she was in severe pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me how I can help you.\" Guided by her mother, she was grateful for the strength she had gained from her physical training. She carefully carried her mother to the car, laid her down in the backseat, and drove off.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scent of disinfectant and an air of anxiety. But she hardly noticed, her mind solely focused on her mother's well-being. She swiftly brought her mother inside, calling out for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered, and someone quickly brought a gurney to lay her mother on. They promptly took her for examination, leaving her daughter to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had toppled from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf in their cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" is linked to a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and mortality due to stroke. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet and is marked by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (in place of saturated fats), and fish, while reducing the intake of animal products and saturated fats. The diet also permits moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown a negative correlation between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. An intervention trial revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically concentrate on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nIn this epidemiological study, 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of CVD or diabetes, were monitored as part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to evaluate nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of the nurses remained involved throughout the 20-year span. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Instances of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through examination of medical or hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, these were considered \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions classified as such. For each FFQ, calculations were made for body mass index, smoking status, use of aspirin, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use. Starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and more accurately reflect long-term dietary consumption, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated by averaging scores from the two preceding years. Adjustments for \"confounders\" (factors that might skew results) were made by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to evaluate the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke categories.\n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as shown by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2,391 incident cases of CHD, 1,763 incident cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes). Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "A sign declares that Hitler is alive in Burma.\n\nEllen Page, known for her role in Juno, stands alone at a street corner holding a cardboard sign with this unsettling message written in Sharpie. Burma, also called Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation ruled by a harsh military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup. In 2007, the country witnessed a series of street protests, the first in a decade. These demonstrations, led by numerous Burmese monks, were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" after the color of the monks' robes. Initially, the Burmese government tolerated these peaceful gatherings, but as public interest grew, the situation deteriorated into a violent conflict between the monks and the military junta. The military began raiding monasteries across the nation. Foreign journalists were arrested on the spot, and a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai was killed on September 27, 2007, merely for covering a protest. Official reports claim 13 deaths, but Colonel Hla Win, who recently defected, suggested that fatalities were in the thousands.\n\nSuch events are not unprecedented. Governments have long sought to suppress dissent to maintain absolute control over their people. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine selection to justify their authority over all societal aspects. Japanese emperors were viewed as deities, meant to guide their people to success. Meanwhile, then U.S. President George W. Bush reportedly held regular calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, linked to the Republic Party.\n\nSome notorious examples include the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4, 1989, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students rallied against the government's authoritarianism. Death toll estimates from these protests vary widely, from 200-300 according to official Chinese reports to 2,000-3,000 as per the Chinese Red Cross. The Rwandan genocide in the 1990s saw Hutu militias, supported by the government, systematically exterminating Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's 'Third Reich' is another extreme case, where Jews were systematically persecuted and killed across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence in jazz can be largely attributed to his extensive career and his exceptional skill in shaping his orchestra's sound. While his piano contributions are often understated in many of the pieces considered for this assignment, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his ability to craft intricate and layered compositions that highlighted the unique talents of his band members. He created a structure that allowed soloists the freedom to improvise, while also composing tightly orchestrated pieces that leveraged the distinctive styles of his musicians to bring musical concepts to life. This approach not only spotlighted individual musicians but also enhanced the overall tone of the orchestra, resulting in cohesive and inventive soundscapes tailored to each composition. Ellington's adeptness at understanding both individual and collective sound within his ensemble enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nIn its discussion of Ellington's sound and innovative approach, the Grove Music dictionary cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his use of the voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This piece illustrates Ellington's technique of using voice to add depth and color, unencumbered by lyrics. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's knack for complementing the style of his soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. As a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece, it unfolds over six choruses:\n\nChorus 1: Engages in a call and response between voice and reeds, starting smooth and melodic, then shifting to a coarser tone by the end.\nChorus 2: Features a muted trumpet solo that expands on the main melody, highlighting several elongated blue notes.\nChorus 3: Presents a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, supported by a subtly syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The entire band echoes the first chorus with call and response from the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: Acts as the climactic point, with reeds initiating a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: Returns to the structure of the first chorus, with voice and reeds engaging in call and response. Here, the voice employs the \"growl\" technique, functioning as an instrumental solo.\nTag: Concludes with a brief vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending from a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice to add tonal dimension to this piece exemplifies a hallmark of his style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington marries his gift for precise orchestration with his sensitivity to tonal color. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing blends the vocal quality of Miley's trumpet with Cox's instrumental-like voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)\" further develops these concepts, with Ellington employing Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a fixture in his orchestra, to great effect as he introduces the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "What drives the evolutionary paths of organisms? Are there limitations or constraints that steer the course of evolutionary transformations? Back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson remarked that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” and this observation still holds true today. In more recent times, researchers have applied mathematical modeling to study the general patterns of mollusk skeletogenesis through both their development and evolutionary history (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research focuses on how mathematical modeling of changes during the development and evolutionary history of Prunum, along with experimental studies, can illuminate the processes that determine the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes. We utilized X-ray images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be employed to simulate both theoretical and real skeletal structures. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). We created models of theoretical shell forms to explore the limits of potential morphological changes in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of major evolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be imagined as a structure that moves through a 360-degree space over time. These rotations or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which are envisioned as spiraling around an imaginary central axis. This axis runs through the core of the shell and is termed the columella. The rate at which the whorls expand can differ, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the final one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the opposite end is the base. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be observed from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. (The “standard” orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex directed upward.)\n\nThe method for counting whorls is outlined below. First, the shell is viewed from the apical perspective to determine where the initial suture starts. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted starting from this line and are measured to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a sequence of apertures that progress through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. It is feasible to trace the path of the aperture using the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radii of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to adjust parameters and alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia has experienced little change in its neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although the nation is progressing well towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, including those related to water and sanitation, the advancements in child and maternal health remain insufficient to reach the 2015 targets. The underlying reasons for these gaps will be explored below, highlighting the necessity of enhancing the health system over isolated programmatic solutions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% of births now falling into this category. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who may lack the ability to handle complicated pregnancies (which contributes to the high incidence of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage). Thus, the apparent progress in this area is somewhat misleading, and significant improvements are still needed. Additionally, there has been a reduction in the percentage of children under five with diarrhea receiving treatment from a health professional. Although data on postnatal care is not comprehensive, it is evident that this remains a critical issue, with low service rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain unexpectedly low at around 4%. This statistic also highlights a concerning issue of disparity. While the c-section rate is 7% in urban areas, it drops to merely 2% in rural regions, indicating unequal healthcare access across the country. Access issues are also evident in terms of vertical equity, with a 27% difference in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. The poorer segments of society face greater challenges in accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nAs we consider steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can service deficiencies be most effectively tackled? Specifically, should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific strategies or work towards reinforcing the overall health system without concentrating solely on maternal and child care before and after pregnancy? While programmatic solutions for the outlined issues are appealing due to their focused and manageable goals, which typically yield quicker results, there are potential drawbacks. A significant downside is that prioritizing a specific health sector can lead to diminished funding for others, drawing human resources away (a scenario seen with the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on the family planning sector). Moreover, operating several parallel programs for a single area can result in service duplication and lack of coordination, increasing paperwork and supply requisition challenges.",
            "Over the last century, the categorization of popular music has evolved to include an overwhelming number of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all comprehensively. Adding to the complexity, nearly every genre—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, among others—has given rise to numerous sub-genres and further subdivisions. Notably, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most varied and expressive forms of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressiveness lies in its ability to convey a broad spectrum of emotions, typically leaning towards the darker end. Its diversity became apparent shortly after the genre emerged, as enthusiasts recognized its adaptability and began experimenting to create new sub-genres, leading to further sub-sub-genres, a trend that persists to this day.\n\nAt present, the heavy metal movement has reached a stage where the abundance of niche groups makes defining heavy metal itself a challenge. Despite incorporating numerous elements from other genres, heavy metal, like all music, has its origins. To truly grasp the essence of today's metal music, one must first comprehend the metal movement and why it is perceived as a movement rather than merely a genre.\n\nIn many respects, metal represents a movement characterized by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. With less primitivism and more technical prowess, musicians in metal bands demonstrate notable instrumental skill, evident in their music. Metal is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement heavily influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug wave of the mid-1970s led people to experiment with wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a creative catalyst. It embodies many dark, visceral elements, a stark contrast to the lighter qualities prevalent in much of popular music. Furthermore, later metal generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, intense characteristics prevalent in the Romantic Era, with lyrics that reflect the movement's inherent darkness.\n\nAn example is found in the lyrics of \"Helter Skelter,\" which reveal the darker side of the Beatles. The song portrays an erratic journey, often interpreted as drug-induced. Considered by some as one of the inaugural Heavy Metal songs, it was a reaction to a Rolling Stones track with a similarly heavy, dark tone. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their capacity to match the Stones' intensity, leading them to include this song on The White Album.",
            "Some years prior to the emergence of Surrealist painters and their dream-inspired creations, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own visions, both in reality and imagination. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only depicts a woman marveling at the enchanting landscape of her dream, but also encapsulates Rousseau’s personal aspirations and challenges as an artist. From the onset of his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers and art enthusiasts. This pursuit led to a profound internal conflict: should he imitate prevalent artistic styles to gain acceptance within the critical art community he cherished, or should he chart his own course, embracing a unique creative expression? \n\nTo appreciate The Dream through this lens, it is essential to understand Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a modest lifestyle (Shattuck 47). Lacking formal artistic education, Rousseau worked as a gabelou, a municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty, despite being mistakenly referred to as a customs inspector or douanier (Shattuck 46). After the tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their children, leaving him with only one surviving daughter, Julia, Rousseau sought solace in painting, hoping it would provide comfort and a fresh start (Shattuck 49). Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized rural life, Rousseau remained a folk painter, reflecting the ambitions and dreams typical of his social class.\n\nRousseau’s preoccupation with gaining acceptance in the art world is understandable when considering his background: he was self-taught, started his artistic career later in life, and was creating alongside many renowned modern artists. Despite years of dedication, Rousseau only began receiving recognition around the same time as Matisse, who was establishing his artistic reputation. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that while Rousseau and Matisse were artistic rivals, they differed in their approach and motivation: “Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, whereas Rousseau longed to create art so conventional it would secure him a place with the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Numerous intellectuals have speculated about the deep link between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I think there's a fundamental reason for this connection. John Keats, in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" famously states, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we understand in life comes through education or personal experience. Yet, as Keats suggests, we seem to grasp ethics and aesthetics without needing explicit teaching. Both fields aim more to describe than to prescribe. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to explain why an artwork or piece of literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, instead of laying out rules for determining or creating good art or ethical behavior.\n\nCritiques of art or morals often fall short of capturing the true essence of what makes something good or beautiful. Discussions about the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for instance, might focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't fully explain why it is considered great art. When people are asked about their favorite artwork or literature, they often start with something like, \"There's just something about it,\" before offering a more detailed or critical analysis. I believe both art and morals cannot be wholly reduced to descriptions of their attributes. As Flannery O'Connor notes, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how thoroughly we describe a piece of literature, there's something beyond that remains. I think ethics shares this feature. Wittgenstein remarks, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.” I propose that this \"something,\" this indescribable quality, is the most powerful aspect of art and morality, and it's this transcendental characteristic that links ethics and aesthetics.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a profound, almost ineffable level. They touch us in ways that can be felt but not fully articulated. This connection is even more pronounced in the realm of literature. As McKean comments, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Modern Germany is recognized as a powerful and unified nation, showcasing a diverse tapestry of culture that stretches from the Alpine shadows in Munich to the coastal city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. This cultural richness is evident from Cologne on the Rhine River, through Germany's heartland, reaching the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. It is unsurprising that contemporary Germany is a product of various origins and tribes, given its unique cultural heritage.\n\nThe land historically known as Germania is the ancestral home of the Germans, though the origins of its name are debated among academics. Tacitus suggested that it originated from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to fight the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first mentioned the term \"Germanus\" in his writings on the Gallic Wars, where he described conflicts with Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine with questionable intentions. He borrowed this term from the Gauls to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes. Some scholars speculate that the name may refer to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In his commentary on the wars, Caesar noted, “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Other theories suggest the name might derive from the weapon they used, a spear known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" reflecting the Germans' boisterous nature (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, the Roman historian Tacitus described the origins of the Germans: “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98).\n\nWhy would anyone abandon Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, at least not at that time. They occasionally launched campaigns into Germania for resources but generally returned to their vast empire. As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they settled at the edges of the Roman Empire, trading goods and offering their skills as soldiers within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the theme of disguise plays a critical role, suggesting that while it can effectively sustain deception for extended periods, ultimately, individuals must abandon these false identities to avoid losing their true selves. A significant challenge in ending such a deception is the potential alienation that may follow. Therefore, one faces a choice between self-preservation and maintaining relationships with others. Some might respond indifferently to being deceived, while others may feel deeply offended by the ruse.\n\nThe issue of deception is particularly complex when it involves gender role reversal, raising questions such as why someone would feel compelled to abandon their identity and assume the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola's situation, her disguise serves as a protective measure: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola adopts a male persona to safeguard herself against potential threats. Her strategy succeeds, but it also distances her from the women who could have supported her. Complicating matters further, Olivia, mistaking Viola for Sebastian, falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, Viola must navigate her own romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261).\n\nTo contemporary readers, Twelfth Night might be viewed as a narrative exploring how deception can reveal hidden emotions, especially for characters like Olivia and Orsino. Certain parts of the play suggest that these characters confront subconscious feelings prompted by Viola/Cesario's presence. For instance, Olivia's attraction to Cesario raises the question of whether she is drawn to the perceived masculinity or if she harbors latent feelings for women. However, it is more plausible that Shakespeare intended Olivia to satirize those of his era who judge others based solely on appearances. This is supported by how easily Olivia transfers her affections to Sebastian and starts viewing Cesario/Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315).",
            "Observers have often highlighted the harshness of German colonial rule, particularly regarding the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in what was then German South West Africa. While such a generalization cannot fully capture the complexity of an entire colonial empire, it is important to recognize that the German colonial territories differed widely in terms of policies and governance styles, reflecting their geographic diversity. Similarly, educational initiatives varied across the colonies. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (present-day Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. German efforts in education in places like Kamerun and other colonies were acknowledged positively by contemporary writers.\n\nThe circumstances in South West Africa (now Namibia) were markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government was proactive in establishing state schools and significantly involved in the education of the local population, in South West Africa, educational responsibilities for the native inhabitants were largely handed over to missionary societies with minimal government assistance. Conversely, substantial resources were allocated to the education of Europeans in the colony, with the establishment of state schools and increased support and regulation of missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, persisting beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies had notable numbers of educated and literate Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this distinct experience in South West Africa. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, focusing on recent research concerning the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is an abundance of literature specifically addressing education within the German colonial empire. Most of these works are in German, written during or shortly after the period of German colonial dominance. Early writings primarily sought to outline the characteristics of educational systems in these territories. Subsequent English-language studies expanded the analysis through comparative examinations of education across different German colonies and more in-depth evaluations of specific educational elements. These studies highlighted notable disparities in educational systems among various colonies. The most significant work addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s analysis of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies and explores the factors that led to their differences. According to Cohen, the substantial settler population in South West Africa accounts for many distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nRelative to Germany’s other colonial territories, South West Africa had a somewhat temperate climate, though much of the land is arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable living conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, whereas the next largest settler population was in East Africa, with only 5,336 Europeans.",
            "The United States and Mexico serve as an illustration of two countries that once experienced a prolonged rivalry lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 marked the peak of this conflict, during which the United States attacked and defeated Mexico, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest as new territories. Numerous other conflicts occurred between these nations, finally subsiding just before World War I. The rivalry originated from clashes between Americans and Mexicans over key issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, along with significant material interests (Schmitt 1974, pp. 30-31). \n\nThis scenario is similar to many other countries that maintain an enduring rivalry with a neighboring nation. Countries sharing borders often encounter conflicting interests, leading to rival positions. The United States and Mexico are comparable to other long-standing rivalries between nations with shared borders. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Indeed, both nations are geographically close to the United States and have historically been rivals, while other Latin American countries have generally enjoyed amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences created a division between the United States and Mexico, a challenge that has affected many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) mentions that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86). Unlike the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which was partly an ideological struggle and partly a competition over crucial interests, the U.S.-Mexico ideological tensions were rooted in religious preferences. This mistrust stemmed from the historical distrust between the English and Spanish, and these inherited feelings posed a significant hurdle in establishing friendly foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identify 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes, as described by Diehl and Goerts, involved territorial issues related to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier challenges. Raids by bandits and outlaws on American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations exerted military control over their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) points out that the rivalry began to diminish as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109), eventually concluding as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen illness left me suddenly disabled, a condition I had never encountered before.\n\nAt that time, I was working as a nurse. I had chosen this career path driven by a profound need for the stability and security that I lacked during my childhood. \"Nursing will always provide job opportunities; people will always need healthcare,\" was the advice I repeatedly heard as I grew up. Although my true aspirations were to become a scientist or a journalist—or ideally a blend of both—I opted for nursing.\n\nHowever, at 46, I found myself single, with no financial savings to rely on, and unable to work. Even now, after 15 years of depending on Social Security Disability, I have very little that I can call my own. Every day remains a challenge, continuously undermining my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty defines my life, yet one thing remains clear: I couldn't have survived all these years without the support of my family and a few close friends, regardless of my inner strength. When true disaster hits, any sense of strength quickly diminishes.\n\nThe reality is that life is filled with both major and minor emergencies. No amount of preparation can guarantee a smooth path; some challenges are simply too immense to tackle alone.\n\nI fully agree that we in the U.S. should not rely solely on the government, whose systems are deteriorating. I would prefer to see Americans rediscovering trust in each other—learning to offer and accept help—rather than each of us building isolated defenses.\n\nConservative rhetoric often praises \"rugged individualism\" as a cornerstone of American history. However, the truth is that our ancestors endured hardships through compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. Pioneers who ventured across the Rockies in wagon trains didn't succeed by going it alone.\n\nTherefore, while it’s important to be prepared—I am, with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned food—it's equally crucial to connect with your neighbors.\n\nIf you have the means to cultivate a small farm or preserve your own food, it's a wise choice. A wood stove is also advantageous, provided you don’t live in an apartment.\n\nYet, as you take these steps, make an effort to get to know those around you.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince, later known as Buddha, was born. Throughout his lifetime, he chose to leave worldly life behind and reached enlightenment, which gave rise to Buddhism. The most traditional branch of this religion is Theravada Buddhism. With a history spanning about 2,500 years, Buddhism has evolved and looks quite distinct from what it was during Buddha’s time. This evolution is evident, for example, in Sri Lanka—a Theravada Buddhist country—where an annual water-cutting ceremony is held. This event involves both monks and laypeople and holds religious significance, even though Buddha did not mention such festivities. These changes range from surface-level traditions to the deep soteriological essence of the faith. Over time, the Theravada Buddhist community, including both monks and lay followers, has adapted its doctrinal principles due to various influences, both from within and outside the community, and both positive and negative.\n\nSeveral key terms will be used frequently in this discussion. The distinction between internal and external forces is crucial. Internal forces are those arising from members within the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces aim to harm or disrupt the Buddhist community, stemming from negative views of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community, though their impact may inadvertently be beneficial or detrimental. These concepts will be referenced throughout the discussion.\n\nTo start with, it is essential to explore the fundamental doctrines at the heart of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, or the three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka includes the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical ideas include Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (the inherent suffering of life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth. Upon enlightenment, Sansara ceases, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: not to kill, lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, or consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more strict rules. The four noble truths are central to Buddhism: first, the truth of Dukkha, that life is suffering; second, that attachment causes suffering; and third, that suffering can be overcome."
