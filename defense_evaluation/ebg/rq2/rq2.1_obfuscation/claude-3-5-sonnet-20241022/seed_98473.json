            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "When engaging in negotiations, cultural awareness emerges as a critical factor. The concept of culture resists simple categorization; it manifests as a complex tapestry of behaviors, beliefs, and practices. Sweeping generalizations about national characteristics—for instance, attributing specific traits to entire populations—often miss the nuanced reality of human interaction. Instead, successful negotiators focus on understanding how cultural elements specifically influence the dynamics at the bargaining table.\n\nIndividuals naturally view unfamiliar cultures through the lens of their own experiences. To bridge cultural gaps effectively, one must invest time in understanding the target culture's historical context and inherent biases. Success in cross-cultural negotiations demands acceptance rather than criticism, particularly when operating from a position of limited leverage. This principle becomes especially relevant when conducting business in unfamiliar territories, where respecting local customs can facilitate breakthrough moments.\n\nCultural considerations extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its distinctive environment, manifesting in various ways—from workplace timing expectations to dress requirements. These differences appear in multiple aspects: communication preferences, organizational hierarchies, and recruitment strategies. Even within single organizations, notable variations exist across different locations and settings. While some societies might present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals underlying complexities.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides crucial insight into cultural motivations. In environments prioritizing group harmony and reputation preservation, negotiators typically avoid actions that might compromise organizational or leadership standing. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may pursue aggressive bargaining strategies. While these broad cultural patterns merit consideration, developing personal connections with negotiating counterparts often proves equally valuable for achieving optimal outcomes.",
            "When examining theological discourse, we encounter a fascinating quote from Psalms that declares \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This declaration appears prominently in both biblical text and philosophical arguments, particularly those of Anselm and Aquinas. In analyzing their respective positions on divine existence, we must establish parameters. Given that both philosophers advocate for the Christian deity specifically, our comparative analysis should focus on their methodologies rather than debating which conception of divinity they defend. However, despite their earnest attempts, neither thinker provides an entirely satisfactory framework for establishing God's existence.\n\nAnselm's methodology centers on internal contemplation and rational deduction. His argument posits that divine existence can be demonstrated through pure reason and self-reflection. The core of his thesis suggests that because we can conceptualize a perfect being, such a being must necessarily exist, as existence itself is a form of perfection. This introspective approach relies heavily on mental exercises and logical constructs, eschewing external validation in favor of intellectual meditation.\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions an empirical approach, developing five distinct pathways to prove God's existence through observable phenomena. His methodology would particularly appeal to skeptics and those requiring tangible evidence, as it builds upon natural observation rather than abstract reasoning. Aquinas presents arguments based on motion, causation, necessity, gradation, and design. His framework resembles solving a jigsaw puzzle - by understanding the shape of what's missing, one can deduce the nature of the absent piece without direct observation. This empirically-grounded approach stands in marked contrast to Anselm's contemplative methodology.",
            "Literary authors employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. In examining \"The Great Gatsby,\" we observe how effectively its creator manipulates language and symbolism to achieve desired effects. One notable approach involves unconventional pairing of descriptive words with objects, creating unexpected associations. However, perhaps more intriguing is the deliberate use of color symbolism throughout the narrative.\n\nThe novel demonstrates particular mastery in its deployment of chromatic imagery, especially through shades like amber, emerald, ivory/slate, and crimson/rose. These carefully chosen hues serve as recurring motifs, carrying deeper significance beyond mere visual description. Of particular interest is the author's handling of ivory/slate and crimson/rose tones, which develop distinct connotations as the story progresses.\n\nThe ivory/slate spectrum emerges as a powerful metaphor for conformity and social stratification. Ivory suggests refinement and privilege, while slate conveys aging and diminished glory. This dichotomy manifests throughout the narrative: socialites routinely appear in ivory attire, from the protagonist's casual wear at gatherings to secondary characters' everyday dress. The sole deviation occurs during the notorious party scene, where vivid primary colors dominate instead.\n\nThese neutral tones extend beyond fashion to characterize environments and individuals alike. Urban landscapes feature ivory canyons of architecture, while social registers contain slate-colored names of party attendees. Even residential descriptions emphasize this palette, with apartments described as segments of a massive ivory structure. Common folk and ordinary settings consistently receive these neutral descriptors: childhood memories, vehicles, landscapes, and various background characters all bear these understated hues.\n\nOnce established, this color symbolism becomes instrumental in character development, particularly regarding the female love interest. Her consistent association with ivory tones gradually transforms her from a dynamic character into a symbol of societal conformity, representing an idealized yet ultimately uniform object of desire.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local producers cultivate an impressive array of crops, ranging from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh herbs and seasonal berries. The region's thriving organic agriculture sector experiences unprecedented demand, evidenced by extensive waitlists for community-supported farming initiatives. Beyond traditional farming, these establishments frequently serve as educational venues, offering guided tours and recreational opportunities like nature walks and wildlife observation.\n\nThe transition to organic farming methods presents both opportunities and challenges for agricultural entrepreneurs. While organic practices foster enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem health through chemical-free cultivation, they demand significant investment in manual labor and innovative pest management strategies. Smaller organic operations often struggle to achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by conventional farms, necessitating creative approaches to revenue generation.\n\nThis case study examines a 160-acre property situated near Potrero, California, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land encompasses diverse ecosystems, including chaparral, Mediterranean grassland (non-indigenous), and oak woodland habitats. This location falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone, as defined by San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The area serves as habitat for numerous protected species, including the imperiled Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher, among others facing population decline.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples inhabited this region for generations before ranchers and wood merchants established themselves in the nineteenth century. The property's origins as a homestead suggest its historical use for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis explores potential governmental support programs available to small-scale farmers interested in balancing agricultural productivity with wildlife conservation, using an existing organic operation in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection, particularly between brothers - a connection that transcends ordinary relationships and encompasses a spectrum of powerful emotions. From affection to rivalry, from admiration to resentment, these feelings intertwine in complex patterns. When brothers look at each other, they often glimpse reflections of themselves, and this mirror effect becomes most pronounced during times of crisis. The true test of brotherly bonds emerges in moments of extreme pressure, revealing either nobility or darkness within their relationship. These revelations often come at significant personal cost, as the consequences of brotherhood-driven actions ripple through their lives.\n\nThis intricate dynamic is masterfully portrayed in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where readers witness the relationship between two siblings unfold against a richly detailed Southern backdrop. The story traces their journey - both literal and metaphorical - through a landscape as complex as their relationship. The narrative reaches its peak in a dramatic confrontation where fraternal pride collides with devastating reality, ultimately claiming one brother's life. Through careful character development and first-person narration, the author reveals the elder brother's complicated emotional landscape and his perception of the world around him.\n\nThe older brother's character arc revolves primarily around his overwhelming sense of pride. His relationship with Doodle, his younger sibling, is colored by persistent disappointment from their earliest interactions. He had envisioned teaching a brother the quintessential childhood activities - breath-holding contests, sprinting across fields, scaling vines in Old Woman Swamp, and racing to Horsehead Landing. He longed for a companion to share adventures with, particularly someone to join him in his favorite perch atop the towering pine behind their barn. These aspirations proved impossible due to Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival and permanently limited his physical capabilities. This harsh reality so devastated the protagonist that he briefly contemplated a horrifying solution - suffocation with a pillow. Yet, this dark impulse dissolved instantly when confronted with Doodle's innocent smile, revealing that beneath his disappointment lay an innate, unshakeable brotherly love.",
            "Our neural architecture represents an intricate system capable of processing vast amounts of data while exhibiting remarkable creativity. Throughout history, scholars have drawn parallels between the mind and contemporary innovations of their time - from ancient writing surfaces to modern computational devices. However, one must exercise caution when employing such analogies, as they often fall short of capturing the brain's true complexity.\n\nNeural processing initiates when our sensory receptors convert environmental stimuli into neural signals. These signals undergo dual processing mechanisms: ascending pathways compile basic sensory data, while descending pathways facilitate rapid interpretation based on existing knowledge. Consider observing a dark square against a light field - ascending processes identify elementary features like edges and contrast, while descending processes aid in determining whether we're viewing a solid object or a void.\n\nThe neural gateway of attention determines which signals merit deeper cognitive engagement. This filtering mechanism explains why we might overlook countless environmental details - such as individual grass blades beneath our feet - yet instantly recognize our name in crowded environments. This selective process occurs continuously throughout various stages of cognitive processing.\n\nData storage within neural networks occurs through multiple memory systems. These include immediate sensory registers, temporary working storage, and permanent neural archives. The encoding process varies by input type - linguistic information, for instance, may be stored based on visual appearance, acoustic properties, or meaning. Research suggests temporary memory maintenance involves neural circuits sustaining electrical activity for approximately twenty seconds, while long-term storage likely depends on protein structural modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks explaining neural knowledge organization. These theories draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent model suggests information exists as interconnected conceptual nodes - similar to a web where related concepts (like \"furniture,\" \"wood,\" and \"dining\") form natural associations.",
            "The devastating economic collapse of 2007 marked a turning point in American financial history. As millions lost their jobs, homeowners faced foreclosure, and major financial institutions crumbled, the nation grappled with an unprecedented crisis that continues to influence policy decisions today. The root causes trace back to a complex web of misguided financial practices, particularly the widespread distribution of high-risk mortgages within an inadequately regulated system. Financial giants, including government-sponsored enterprises, engaged in questionable practices involving mortgage derivatives, ultimately triggering a domino effect when borrowers began defaulting en masse.\n\nThe seeds of destruction were planted during the late 1990s, when political motivations led to significant changes in lending policies. Contemporary journalism captured this shift, with notable coverage from The New York Times highlighting how Fannie Mae faced mounting pressure to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. These prescient reports warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to previous financial sector bailouts.\n\nThe crisis's complexity deepened through innovative but risky financial instruments. Financial markets embraced sophisticated mortgage products and derivatives, creating an intricate web of dependencies throughout the economy. This interconnectedness left the entire system vulnerable to fluctuations in housing prices, as households and institutions accumulated unprecedented levels of debt exposure to real estate.\n\nThe eventual market correction proved catastrophic. Major investment banks, collectively holding mortgage-related obligations worth nearly one-third of America's GDP, faced existential threats. The landscape of American finance transformed dramatically: prestigious institutions either collapsed or underwent forced acquisitions, while others abandoned their investment banking status to survive under stricter regulatory frameworks. Government-sponsored enterprises, bearing the weight of trillions in mortgage obligations, ultimately required federal intervention to prevent complete collapse.",
            "Let's discuss the perils of information dumps in storytelling. Writers often face a temptation to unleash torrents of background details, believing they're crafting intricate narrative tapestries. However, this approach frequently backfires, leading readers to disengage or abandon the story entirely. Even experienced authors sometimes catch themselves drowning their narratives in excessive detail.\n\nInformation dumping is a narrative pitfall.\n\nWhile most writers understand the fundamental principle of demonstrating rather than explaining, it's remarkably easy to slip into lengthy descriptive passages where action stagnates or becomes overwhelming. This tendency often manifests as an internal struggle between two competing urges: the desire to establish context quickly versus the impulse to elaborate on every minute detail of character backgrounds.\n\nInformation dumping occurs when writers explicitly state background information instead of weaving it naturally into the narrative. In cinema, this manifests as dialogue-heavy scenes where characters unnaturally explain situations to each other. Literary works face similar challenges when authors resort to direct exposition.\n\nConsider this scenario: A narrative briefly summarizes a couple's entire relationship - their meeting, wedding, and the tragic murder of the spouse - in just two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach deprives readers of crucial emotional connections. Instead, the story should illustrate the husband's devotion through his actions and words, demonstrate how the relationship transformed both characters, and allow readers to form genuine attachments to these individuals. This investment makes the tragedy more impactful and reveals deeper insights into the surviving character's personality.\n\nEssentially, narratives require substance beyond basic plot points.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly catalogue character details. For instance, when introducing a former Air Force servicemember who now manages a gas station at night, has two failed marriages, enjoys fishing, harbors entrepreneurial ambitions, and maintains specific breakfast preferences, these details deserve thoughtful integration rather than immediate disclosure.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable broadcasts on NBC 4. The morning programming began with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended an individual following an assault on his spouse involving multiple stab wounds. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the situation.\n\nSubsequently, the broadcast covered an incident involving an 18-year-old victim of gun violence in the Sharon Woods district. The coverage appeared notably brief despite the severity of the incident and ongoing SWAT involvement. This observation raises questions about potential disparities in media coverage based on demographic factors, as I've noted a pattern of abbreviated reporting when victims belong to minority communities.\n\nThe broadcast continued with details regarding an aviation incident involving a medical transport helicopter that sustained damage from what investigators determined to be a .22 caliber projectile. Authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to the perpetrator's identification.\n\nWeather coverage followed, albeit briefly, highlighting anticipated precipitation and moderate temperatures for the weekend period. The concise nature of this segment appeared strategically designed to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe program also reported on a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, with what seemed to be disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's physical characteristics and racial identity. The final segment detailed the conviction of a narcotics distributor responsible for interstate trafficking operations, with an unusual presentation of the sentence duration in months rather than years, and arguably unnecessary emphasis on the individual's ethnic background.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. These investment vehicles mirror various market segments while offering advantages typically associated with individual stocks, including short-selling opportunities, margin trading, and single-share purchasing options. Despite providing these sophisticated features, ETFs maintain surprisingly competitive cost structures, with management fees significantly below typical mutual fund rates.\n\nInvestors should note certain trade-offs, particularly the requirement to pay brokerage commissions on transactions, similar to stock trades. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across numerous sectors and asset classes. However, prudent investors must conduct thorough due diligence regarding marketed advantages such as portfolio diversification, carefully assessing both their presence and magnitude.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the healthcare ETF designated as IHF, comparing its characteristics against its primary constituent stocks. Our investigation aims to determine whether holding the ETF provides comparable benefits to maintaining positions in its major components, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns or absolute performance.\n\nGiven practical constraints, our examination concentrates on the fund's top ten holdings, which constitute approximately 63.58% of total assets. These positions serve as our analytical foundation.\n\nTo assess how effectively these major components reflect the complete IHF portfolio, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the resulting portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns. Our computational framework is detailed in the accompanying data.\n\nInitial findings reveal intriguing disparities: a hypothetical portfolio comprising solely these primary holdings generates returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points, representing a 16% performance differential. Additionally, this concentrated portfolio exhibits reduced market sensitivity, with a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. While these preliminary results suggest potential advantages in holding the individual components, we must consider whether these differences achieve statistical significance.\n\nTo address this question, we analyzed the standard deviations of the constituent stocks, normalizing these values for direct comparison with the ETF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter participation during the project's third month. Multiple factors likely contributed to this decline. The harsh New England winter climate naturally discourages cycling and walking commuters. Additionally, December's academic pressures, including final examinations and grading periods, combined with holiday preparations and extended breaks, may have reduced participation. The late January resumption of classes also correlates with diminished log submissions. However, these factors alone cannot fully explain February's unexpectedly low participation rates.\n\nSuch initiatives often demonstrate strong initial enthusiasm followed by waning engagement. To counter this pattern, our team implemented a focused \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, successfully boosting participation rates. This experience highlighted two key operational challenges: sustaining momentum despite natural engagement decline, and adapting to academic calendar disruptions inherent to educational institutions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative transportation initiatives lies in American society's deep-rooted automotive culture, which values personal mobility and convenience. Our incentive strategy included distributing various gift certificates to local establishments - restaurants, cafes, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating progressively valuable rewards might have better sustained participation. While initial gift card offerings proved adequate, introducing more substantial prizes - such as premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - could have prevented participation decline. A tiered reward structure, announcing increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project timeline, might have maintained or even enhanced engagement levels instead of experiencing the observed downturn.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I explored their collection of early Edison trick films, encompassing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces demonstrate the innovative use of editing techniques to create magical illusions. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unexpected deviations in these early cinematic experiments.\n\nThe majority of these productions adhered to specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a static camera positioned like a theatrical audience, and maintained consistent distance from their subjects. Most significantly, they typically consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous take. However, as the new century dawned, several bold filmmakers began challenging these established norms by incorporating multiple distinct scenes.\n\nWhat stands out immediately is the theatrical staging of these productions. The camera remains stationary, as if representing an audience member's fixed perspective, while the action unfolds within a defined performance space. This approach clearly reflects the influence of stage performances, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where performers move laterally across the frame, never approaching or retreating from the viewing position - much like actors confined to a physical stage.\n\nThis theatrical influence extends to shot composition as well. The films consistently employ wide and occasional medium-distance views, completely avoiding close-range shots. This mirrors the live theater experience, where audiences observe the entire stage simultaneously. The performers maintain their distance from the camera, preserving the illusion of watching a stage production.\n\nThese early works typically presented what seemed to be one continuous scene, usually lasting no more than sixty seconds. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, resulting in brief, vaudeville-style demonstrations focusing on magical transformations and disappearances rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that many of these apparently continuous scenes actually comprised multiple shots cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful examination reveals the precise moment where separate shots were combined to create the illusion.",
            "Literary scholars often note the fascinating contradiction inherent in Gothic fiction's nomenclature, as it represents a fusion of antiquated and contemporary elements. This genre has experienced varying degrees of critical reception throughout history, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.' When Horace Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, widely acknowledged as the first Gothic novel, he deliberately merged classical romantic conventions with modern narrative techniques, establishing a groundbreaking literary framework.\n\nThe term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations even during Otranto's publication era, referencing diverse cultural and architectural elements from medieval periods. Despite being considered somewhat primitive compared to contemporary literary developments, the genre's unique combination of theatrical elements and psychological depth has granted it remarkable staying power, allowing it to feel simultaneously dated and fresh to modern readers.\n\nMedieval chivalric traditions play a central role in Gothic literature's thematic foundation. In Otranto, these ideals undergo both preservation and transformation. The emphasis on chivalric values reflects a broader cultural commentary, as authors like Walpole observed what they perceived as moral decay in their contemporary society. Writing during politically turbulent times, Walpole's work suggests a nostalgic yearning for the perceived moral certainties of medieval times.\n\nThis perspective manifests clearly in characters such as Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. His characterization as a noble prince who endures hardship and faces presumed death at the hands of non-believers exemplifies the genre's tendency toward melodramatic excess while maintaining core chivalric ideals. This portrayal demonstrates how Gothic fiction often amplified traditional heroic qualities to create its distinctive atmosphere.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer orders through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first articulated by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, describes a comprehensive framework for orchestrating and monitoring supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements efficiently. The discipline rests on six fundamental pillars: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock management, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodology of production processes. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the most reliable indicator of demand patterns. Upon completing market research and gaining clarity on consumer requirements, decision-makers can determine product specifications and production volumes. Subsequently, they select optimal manufacturing locations based on capacity requirements and quality standards, while maintaining focus on consumer satisfaction metrics. The final manufacturing considerations involve workflow scheduling and equipment maintenance protocols. The manufacturing phase demands meticulous attention to detail, as oversights can result in significant financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized procedures - from dress codes to receiving protocols - facilitate smooth operations.\n\nResource procurement, the second pillar, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Organizations often maintain multiple production divisions for single product lines, each equipped with specialized machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division assignments for various production phases. Additionally, they may opt for external partnerships to enhance velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while achieving or preserving cost efficiencies.",
            "The literary landscape of Victorian England was dominated by narratives that meticulously detailed aristocratic life. However, two notable exceptions, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, deviate significantly from these conventions. These works distinguish themselves through their incorporation of supernatural elements and unconventional storytelling techniques, which serve to illuminate their characters' psychological depths and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (220)\n\nThese narratives frequently employ dream sequences as a literary device, though each author adapts this technique to their specific narrative purposes. In Oliver Twist, these surreal interludes function as windows into the protagonist's psyche, revealing his innermost turmoil and growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this effectively. The dreamlike recollection emphasizes his powerlessness while highlighting his deteriorating physical state, particularly through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting scene's sensory overload - where Oliver barely registers the \"unseen hand\" guiding him - underscores his complete disorientation. This persistent pain, now intertwined with fear rather than initial shock, suggests deeper psychological implications. The sequence raises questions about agency and fate, as Oliver's passive response indicates potential psychological manipulation by Fagin, who may have successfully instilled a sense of helplessness in the young protagonist.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my time as an elementary school tutor, I encountered a memorable situation that highlighted a significant educational challenge. While assisting students with various subjects, particularly reading and English, I was asked to help a third-grade student named Adrian. His reading difficulties presented an unusual pattern - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly but struggled inexplicably with others.\n\nDespite being from a Latino background, Adrian's spoken English was impeccable. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his mother while supervising remaining students during a field trip day. She communicated exclusively in Spanish, and through my basic Spanish skills, we managed a conversation. This interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's reading challenges stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than comprehension issues.\n\nThis experience illuminates the complexities of language barriers in California's educational system. It demonstrates how language-related challenges can manifest in unexpected ways - even students with excellent verbal English skills may struggle with written language. While Adrian's situation required focused alphabet and pronunciation tutoring, many students face more substantial language barriers requiring comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe educational system needs a multi-faceted approach combining various strategies: dual-language programs, mainstream immersion, individualized tutoring, and ESL classes. Research demonstrates that two-way bilingual education programs yield superior academic results for all participants, not just non-native English speakers. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual might be impractical, incorporating bilingual educational support staff could create more inclusive and effective learning environments. This approach would benefit both English learners and native English speakers, fostering a more comprehensive educational experience.",
            "Since ancient times, humans have grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. Various paths lead to spiritual enlightenment: some find solace in churches, others in synagogues, while many seek answers through introspection. Though numerous individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions, others steadfastly reject such notions, embracing a more self-centered worldview. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems, sometimes discarding one for another. Each person's quest for meaning follows a unique trajectory, like countless paths leading toward illumination.\n\nI remember a conversation with Dad during a stormy afternoon. We were sheltered on the porch, cigarettes in hand, listening to raindrops drumming against the metal roofing. \"Cardinals,\" he answered when I inquired about his preferred avian species. Water cascaded from the gutters, drenching the botanical border below. His gaze wandered across the misty landscape, appearing both present and distant. Disease had ravaged his frame; clothing hung loose where it once fit snugly, and his formerly thick hair had grown sparse. Words about mortality remained unspoken between us - acknowledging them would make everything too tangible. Instead, I shifted closer, embracing him briefly before joining his contemplative watch of the summer shower.\n\nHis departure came in December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. Medical interventions prolonged his life beyond predictions, though their merit seemed questionable given his extended suffering. My faith wavered; the concept of a benevolent deity became increasingly difficult to reconcile with such cruel reality. Nighttime brought no comfort through prayer - any divine presence felt distant and indifferent.\n\nI made a conscious choice to avoid witnessing his final moments. Understanding him as intimately as I did, I knew he wouldn't want his child present for that transition. I chose to preserve memories of his vitality rather than his decline. While others gathered, I remained isolated in my bedroom for three days, awaiting inevitable news.\n\nThe silence of my phone spoke volumes.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideology stood John Taylor of Caroline, whose agricultural background and limited political experience shaped his passionate advocacy for individual liberties and governmental reform. His agricultural roots fundamentally influenced his perspectives on governance, sovereignty, constitutional matters, and judicial frameworks.\n\nThe absence of entrenched traditions in America presented, according to Taylor, an unprecedented opportunity to establish genuine self-governance. He emphasized the interconnected nature of human rights, arguing that these fundamental liberties must remain untouchable by governmental authority. In his view, while primitive societies might reward physical strength and cunning manipulation, civilized nations must transcend such base dynamics.\n\nTaylor's political philosophy centered on crafting governmental structures that could effectively manage humanity's moral dualism. His framework identified positive principles as those supporting private ownership, agricultural development, and resistance to unchecked capitalism. He theorized that properly designed systems would function effectively despite the inevitable human tendencies toward self-interest and personal gain. While acknowledging self-interest as a universal motivator, Taylor distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nRegarding constitutional interpretation, Taylor advocated for precise adherence while emphasizing contextual understanding. He supported minimal federal authority, limiting it strictly to explicitly granted powers, viewing extensive federal control as potentially tyrannical and financially burdensome. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true founding document, believing it better reflected the sovereign nature of individual states rather than a unified nation.",
            "My eyes fixed upon the scene below, processing the visual input with clinical detachment. Like a computer scanning data, my brain registered the information without emotional interference, maintaining a professional distance from what lay before me. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness like fireflies on a summer evening, there and gone in an instant.\n\nI recalled my brief foray into artistic pursuits several years ago. A colleague had recommended Betty Edwards' celebrated instruction manual on drawing. The book's methodology included a fascinating technique of using viewfinders to isolate portions of complex scenes, effectively simplifying the visual chaos into manageable segments.\n\nBut in this moment, no such mental framing device could help compartmentalize what I witnessed. The sight commanded my full attention, demanding acknowledgment in its raw entirety. Just as the great masters had their signature palettes – Van Gogh's yellows, Vermeer's blues – before me lay the foundation of what could only be termed a masterwork in sepia tones.\n\nWith surgical precision, I initiated the first phase of my task. The porcelain canvas reflected the fluorescent lights above as water circulated in its pristine dance. Particles separated from the main mass, swept away in the current. A second, more forceful attempt at the lever yielded similar results – the stubborn creation remained steadfast in its position.\n\nThere I stood, in my retail uniform, contemplating the unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron of our establishment's facilities. After several unsuccessful attempts to restore order through conventional means, I resigned myself to more direct intervention. Methodically wrapping protective layers around my hand, I prepared for the inevitable. Like a surgeon approaching a delicate procedure, I leaned forward, extending my arm toward the waiting basin...",
            "Recent data reveals an alarming trend in vehicular fatalities among young drivers. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates that adolescent neural development significantly impacts driving capability. Moreover, the fundamental lack of road experience contributes substantially to various driving mishaps, from basic control issues to severe accidents.\n\nStudies, particularly one conducted by researchers at the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, highlight a concerning correlation between passenger age demographics and collision frequency. This finding becomes especially relevant when considering typical adolescent social patterns.\n\nWhile various jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing systems that restrict nighttime driving and passenger numbers, these solutions merely scratch the surface. Evidence suggests that fundamental neurological and behavioral patterns make young drivers inherently more susceptible to dangerous driving behaviors.\n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman's research, featured in USA Today, indicates that risk-taking behaviors peak during late adolescence, suggesting that even eighteen might be premature for full driving privileges. This insight becomes particularly relevant as demographic projections indicate a substantial increase in eligible young drivers, specifically children of Baby-Boomers approaching driving age.\n\nA potential solution lies in standardizing national driving requirements. This approach would maintain educational components while implementing more stringent age restrictions. The framework could incorporate existing state-level requirements - such as California's mandated training hours - into a comprehensive national standard. This proposal builds upon established practices rather than introducing entirely new concepts.\n\nCurrent data spanning multiple states indicates that a unified approach could significantly reduce youth driving fatalities. By implementing evidence-based restrictions and standardized training requirements, we could better protect our young population while maintaining necessary mobility options.",
            "In exploring Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), three fundamental aspects deserve attention. The initial segment explores the basic nature of this condition, followed by an examination of diagnostic procedures and warning signs. The discussion concludes by addressing practical strategies educators can implement to support CAPD students in mainstream educational settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, alternatively known as APD, represents a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes auditory signals. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's 2005 report, this condition impacts the central nervous system's ability to effectively utilize sound information. Notably, individuals with CAPD maintain normal hearing capabilities but struggle with processing auditory input, such as distinguishing speech from ambient noise or processing individual words within conversations.\n\nHistorical records trace the disorder's recognition to mid-twentieth century studies. Initially termed \"auditory imperception,\" CAPD garnered attention when researchers examined communication disorders in children. Significant developments emerged in 1954 through pioneering work by Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari. Later advances came from Kimura's 1961 introduction of dichotic testing methodologies. A watershed moment occurred in 1977 when a national symposium catalyzed extensive research initiatives.\n\nCAPD symptoms encompass various challenges. Affected individuals might struggle with sound localization, experience difficulty distinguishing between concurrent sounds, or fail to recognize acoustic patterns. Additional manifestations include challenges in detecting vocal nuances that convey meaning, such as sarcastic tones. Some patients experience auditory masking, where subsequent sounds override previous ones. Furthermore, individuals might face challenges in processing sound information sequentially or synthesizing acoustic information meaningfully.\n\nDiagnostic procedures typically involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments incorporate behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. Currently, no singular diagnostic tool definitively confirms CAPD, and its underlying causes remain uncertain. Contemporary testing methods often employ simultaneous auditory stimuli, requiring patients to differentiate specific elements like word sequences or numerical patterns. Advanced diagnostic techniques include analyzing inner ear acoustic responses to various signals.",
            "My aspiration to join the Division of Family and Children Services stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for vulnerable youth and support families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation was not straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with personal challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping strategies. These observations guided me toward completing my Psychology degree at Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse. This experience catalyzed my involvement in a situation where I leveraged my psychology background to mediate between law enforcement and the youth's parents. The parents' dismissive attitude toward what they termed \"simple\" disputes revealed the critical need for professional intervention in family dynamics, solidifying my resolve to pursue social work.\n\nMy dedication to social justice extends beyond professional aspirations. Contemporary society presents a paradox: while claiming to value individuality, it often promotes conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I actively challenged societal norms through various forms of self-expression - from unconventional appearance choices to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA participation. My commitment to combating discrimination and promoting equality remains unwavering. This dedication to authentic self-expression and advocacy for marginalized communities continues to drive my professional pursuits in social work.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through both biological and sociocultural perspectives. While biological frameworks emphasize hereditary and medical factors, sociocultural approaches examine how environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables, impact sleep patterns.\n\nSleep disorders fall into several distinct categories. The first encompasses primary sleep disorders, followed by those connected to existing mental health conditions, and finally, those stemming from other causes. Primary sleep disorders branch into two subcategories: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Mental health-related sleep disturbances typically connect to either Axis I or Axis II conditions, while other sleep issues may result from medical conditions or substance use.\n\nWithin the Dyssomnia category, we find several conditions: Primary Insomnia (difficulty sleeping), Primary Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), Narcolepsy (involving cataplexy and REM irregularities), Breathing-Related Sleep Issues, Circadian Rhythm Disruptions, and unspecified cases. Parasomnias, on the other hand, manifest as behavioral or physiological anomalies during sleep, including nightmares, night terrors, sleepwalking, and other unclassified conditions.\n\nRecent research has revealed fascinating biological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Scientists have identified specific neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin that control sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with mice have demonstrated that GABAB receptors on these neurons play a crucial role in sleep regulation. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, sleep was promoted, while GABAB agonists increased overall sleep duration. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep patterns and hereditary sleep disorders, highlighting how genetic factors might influence an individual's ability to maintain healthy sleep patterns without pharmaceutical intervention.",
            "After spending five semesters at University Park, I've gained considerable perspective on the transportation challenges that plague our expanding campus. During my initial year, I resided in Stuart Hall within East Halls complex - a location that sits at the campus's eastern periphery. The journey to central campus locations, such as Willard building, could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nThe campus landscape has undergone significant transformation recently. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls once stood isolated, separated from main campus by vast empty spaces. Now, those areas house athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, plus numerous residential developments. This expansion has only intensified the challenge of campus navigation.\n\nIn addressing these mobility issues, bicycles emerge as the optimal solution for university environments. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after abandoning it for several years. Their enthusiasm was palpable as they noted, \"It's remarkable how cycling has regained its practical appeal - it's truly the most effective transportation method available.\" Beyond its health advantages, cycling represents unprecedented efficiency in human-powered transportation, with minimal fuel requirements beyond basic nutrition.\n\nAs an off-campus resident situated at a distance comparable to some university housing, I can attest to cycling's benefits. My daily commute to Thomas building, typically a 25-minute walk, reduces to merely 5 minutes by bicycle. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my academic schedule demands greater efficiency. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 150 minutes weekly when considering various campus destinations - proves invaluable for maintaining academic and personal commitments.",
            "In his seminal work Brave New World, Huxley presents a haunting vision of society's future, where technological advancement and unbridled consumerism converge to create a nightmarish dystopia. The society depicted prioritizes collective harmony over individual identity, systematically programming its inhabitants to chase fleeting pleasures rather than meaningful fulfillment. These citizens, unknowingly manipulated by the shadowy World Controller, become mere instruments in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about industrial and economic systems of the era. The novel employs classic Marxist concepts - from collective consciousness to social stratification - to highlight the author's growing unease with contemporary societal developments.\n\nThe narrative particularly emphasizes the concept of manufactured consent, where citizens remain blissfully unaware of their true economic relationships. Through sophisticated conditioning techniques, particularly hypnopædia, the lower castes (Deltas, Gammas) are programmed to embrace consumerist behaviors, perpetually pursuing material satisfaction. This manipulation, orchestrated by the World Controller, exemplifies social dominance theory, where elite groups maintain control through subtle yet pervasive means. The higher castes (Alphas, Betas), despite their enhanced cognitive capabilities, largely accept this system, with few exceptions like Bernard questioning the status quo.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the novel's portrayal of human connections - or rather, their absence. Characters appear deliberately two-dimensional, suggesting that technological progress and consumer culture have stripped humanity of its emotional depth. Authentic love is notably absent; instead, relationships are reduced to superficial physical encounters, with men objectifying women's \"pneumatic\" qualities and women casually discussing their liaisons. This emotional flatness, combined with each caste's acceptance of their predetermined role, illustrates how consumer capitalism creates a docile population, content to fulfill their prescribed social functions while maintaining the illusion of personal satisfaction.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that delved into Islamic studies. A recurring theme throughout the semester centered on the perception of Islam in contemporary society. This discussion has only grown more significant in our current political climate. The media's portrayal of Islam has undergone a remarkable transformation since the early 2000s, shifting from overt skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation. This evolution in public sentiment perhaps culminated in the unprecedented candidacy of a presidential hopeful with Islamic familial connections.\n\nThe historical accounts of the Prophet's life present fascinating contradictions that warrant closer examination. Traditional historical records suggest a figure who expanded his influence through military conquest and mandatory religious conversion. However, the biographical texts paint a markedly different picture - one of a misunderstood spiritual leader whose followers came to him voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nWhat stands out particularly are the parallel narratives between Islamic and Christian traditions. One notable example describes the multiplication of food to feed a multitude, bearing striking resemblance to well-documented Christian miracles. This apparent mirroring of sacred events raises questions about the authenticity and originality of these accounts.\n\nThe biographical sources frequently employ a distinctive narrative technique, relying heavily on chains of oral transmission to establish credibility. While this methodology aims to validate the accounts through multiple attestations, it paradoxically introduces elements of uncertainty due to the extended chain of narrators separating the events from their documentation.\n\nThe disparity between historical evidence and biographical portrayal creates a significant cognitive dissonance. While the biographical accounts present an image of a benevolent and humble leader, historical records suggest a more complex figure who employed various means to establish and maintain authority. This raises important questions about historical accuracy and contemporary understanding within the Islamic community.",
            "Historical analysis reveals a substantial divergence between the original teachings of Jesus and subsequent Christian theological developments. This evolution of Christian doctrine demonstrates an increasing departure from its foundational principles. Contemporary society exhibits remarkable progress in understanding and questioning traditional religious interpretations. Although conservative elements persist in maintaining conventional interpretations, their influence appears to be diminishing within the broader social context.\n\nScholars anticipate a significant surge in historical consciousness among Christian communities. This awakening will likely foster a desire to separate later theological additions from Jesus's original message. While this transformation may span generations, its culmination appears inevitable: Christianity will experience a fundamental restructuring, gravitating toward its historical roots. This movement will systematically deconstruct accumulated doctrinal layers, ultimately revealing Jesus's pure theological vision, unencumbered by subsequent interpretations.\n\nAs this theological reformation sweeps across Western societies, inspiring congregations to embrace practices reminiscent of first-century Christianity, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their significance while adapting to this paradigm shift. The current denominational diversity will likely converge toward a more unified expression of faith. Historical precedents for such dramatic transformations exist: consider Rome's evolution from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or America's journey from slavery to racial inclusion in leadership.\n\nThis anticipated religious reformation will necessitate a sophisticated hermeneutical approach, particularly in interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To comprehend this evolution, we must examine Christianity's origins in Judaism. Prior to Rome's occupation of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority. The Jewish community, however, was not monolithic, encompassing diverse groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through a critical analysis of The Jungle, one can observe a profound commentary on humanity's inherent disposition toward avarice and self-preservation. The narrative expertly illustrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of authority, consistently prioritize personal advancement while disregarding the welfare of their subordinates. This phenomenon manifests most prominently in the conduct of industrial magnates and their administrative personnel.\n\nThese powerful figures demonstrate an unwavering commitment to corporate expansion and profit maximization, exhibiting complete indifference to the collateral damage inflicted upon both society and the environment. As Sinclair vividly depicts, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery serves as a metaphor for the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization, highlighting the manufacturers' blatant disregard for ecological consequences, including atmospheric pollution and unsanitary conditions stemming from livestock facilities.\n\nThe exploitation extends beyond environmental concerns to encompass labor relations. As the text states, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The absence of worker protection legislation during this historical period enabled management to subject employees to hazardous conditions and arbitrary termination without recourse. The laborers, predominantly immigrants living in perpetual economic uncertainty, found themselves trapped in a system reminiscent of institutionalized servitude. As Sinclair observes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Literary scholars have long debated the influences behind Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land.\" The recurring mention of \"Thulé\" within the poem presents an intriguing connection to classical literature. While some academics point to Virgil's use of the term - describing a mysterious northern isle beyond Britain's shores - a more compelling source emerges from German literature.\n\nThe connection between Poe's work and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust\" (published in two segments: 1808 and 1832) deserves particular attention. Within \"Faust Part Two,\" Goethe crafts \"The King of Thulé,\" a haunting narrative about a bereaved monarch. This ruler, having received a goblet from his dying queen, descends into grief-stricken drinking before ultimately choosing death, keeping only the meaningful chalice while distributing his other possessions to his heirs. His final act - casting the goblet into the ocean before his own death - resonates deeply with themes found in Poe's writings.\n\nThe thematic parallels between these works are striking. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" explore realms of profound loss, isolation, and darkness. Poe's narrator traverses a colorless landscape populated by ghostly remembrances, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's monarch. Notably, Poe employs \"Thule\" in both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" suggesting a deliberate literary connection.\n\nGoethe's influence on nineteenth-century literature was considerable, and Poe's appreciation for contemporary European writers, particularly Tennyson (himself an admirer of Goethe), suggests he would have been well-versed in the German master's works. The proliferation of Goethe translations and adaptations during this period, including H.P. Grattan's 1842 dramatic interpretation of \"Faust,\" would have made these works readily accessible to American literary circles.",
            "I'm analyzing whether punitive damages could be awarded in a California slip-and-fall case where store management displayed potential negligence regarding a hazardous situation.\n\nThe incident occurred at D&D Markets when customer Jennifer Palmer suffered a severe back injury after slipping on spilled applesauce. The critical element here is that two separate employees had notified Manager Paul Martin about the hazard, yet he chose to continue his dinner break rather than address the situation. The spill remained unattended for approximately 30 minutes before the accident occurred.\n\nThe legal framework in California permits punitive damages when defendants exhibit \"oppression, fraud or malice\" (California Civil Code 3294(a)). In this context, malice encompasses both intentional harm and \"despicable conduct\" showing conscious disregard for safety. Precedent indicates that awareness of probable dangers combined with deliberate inaction can constitute malicious conduct (reference: Taylor v. Superior Court).\n\nSeveral factors strengthen the case for punitive damages. First, D&D Markets had experienced five previous slip-and-fall incidents that same year, establishing a pattern of safety concerns. Second, Martin's repeated dismissal of employee warnings demonstrates conscious disregard for customer safety. While proving \"despicable conduct\" presents challenges, Martin's prioritization of his dinner break over addressing a known safety hazard, especially given the store's history of similar incidents, provides reasonable grounds for pursuing punitive damages.\n\nBased on these considerations, a court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed past summary judgment, though success at trial would depend on effectively demonstrating Martin's conscious disregard for customer safety.",
            "The emptiness gnawed at her consciousness since puberty struck. From the tender age of fourteen through her current seventeen years, an inexplicable void persisted within her soul. Eventually, she recognized that this yearning wasn't for an object but for companionship. Curiously though, despite numerous advances from potential suitors, no male ever sparked her interest. This peculiarity prompted countless hours of introspection, yet no satisfactory explanation emerged to illuminate this romantic anomaly.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere in which she dwelled typically exuded tranquility. Her parents, paragons of serenity, rarely engaged in confrontations, either with each other or their offspring. The sole source of friction arose from her assertions of autonomy - a natural byproduct of her vibrant personality, which stood in stark contrast to her parents' placid demeanor. Her effervescent nature, coupled with genuine kindness, endeared her to many.\n\nThe day's peaceful facade shattered with an unexpected shriek emanating from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice, now distorted by pain, pierced the air. Rushing to investigate, she discovered her maternal figure sprawled across the floor, each breath punctuated by agonized gasps. \"Hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths. Drawing upon strength cultivated through dedicated training, she carefully transported her injured mother to their vehicle, positioning her gently across the back seat before embarking on an urgent journey.\n\nThe clinical environment of the emergency room, with its characteristic antiseptic atmosphere and underlying current of anxiety, barely registered in her consciousness. Her singular focus remained on securing immediate medical attention for her mother. After facilitating a swift transfer onto a gurney, she watched helplessly as medical personnel whisked her mother away for evaluation.\n\nThe catalyst for this crisis? A simple domestic accident - her mother's unfortunate tumble from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a decorative vessel from an elevated storage space.",
            "Recent research explores the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns resembling traditional Mediterranean cuisine. Investigators aimed to evaluate whether individuals following Mediterranean-inspired eating habits, quantified through an adapted scoring system (aMed), experienced reduced instances of heart disease, stroke occurrences, and related fatalities.\n\nThe aMed framework emphasizes abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and proteins derived from plants and fish, while limiting animal-based products. It promotes the use of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats over saturated alternatives and permits reasonable alcohol consumption.\n\nEarlier investigations revealed promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating patterns and decreased mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes. One notable experiment demonstrated superior outcomes in obese participants following Mediterranean guidelines compared to low-fat dietary restrictions, specifically regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles. However, these previous analyses hadn't specifically targeted stroke-related outcomes.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals, aged 38-63, participating in a broader health assessment initiative across 11 American states. Researchers collected dietary information through detailed questionnaires at six intervals between 1984 and 2004, maintaining an impressive 95% participant retention rate. The team verified reported cardiovascular events through medical documentation, with approximately one-fifth classified as probable cases when complete records weren't available.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of dietary adherence scores and accounted for various lifestyle factors, including exercise habits, smoking status, and hormone therapy use. Statistical analysis employed Cox proportional-hazard models to evaluate relationships between dietary patterns and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective benefits among participants demonstrating stronger Mediterranean diet adherence. Throughout the two-decade observation period, researchers documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths. Statistical analysis indicated that participants with the highest dietary compliance experienced 29% lower risk compared to those with minimal adherence.",
            "A solitary figure emerges from the urban landscape - actress Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, displaying a peculiar message board overhead. The text, drafted in permanent marker, makes an outlandish claim about Hitler's whereabouts in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has endured decades of military control since a 1962 military takeover. The nation witnessed unprecedented civil unrest in 2007, marked by what became known as the \"Saffron Revolution\" - named for the distinctive garments worn by Buddhist monks who initiated the demonstrations. As public participation swelled, the initially tolerant military regime's response grew increasingly hostile, culminating in widespread monastery raids and violent confrontations.\n\nInternational media faced severe restrictions, with journalists facing immediate detention. The situation turned deadly when Kenji Nagai, a photojournalist from Japan, lost his life while documenting a demonstration on September 27th, 2007. Although official records indicate only 13 casualties, a military defector, Colonel Hla Win, suggested the actual death count reached thousands.\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese imperial tradition ascribed godlike status to their rulers. Even modern governance shows traces of authoritarian tendencies, as exemplified by certain political-religious alliances in contemporary America.\n\nHistorical precedents include China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, where peaceful demonstrators faced military intervention. Casualty estimates vary dramatically - Chinese authorities claim 200-300 deaths, while Red Cross data suggests 2,000-3,000 perished. The 1990s Rwandan crisis saw systematic elimination of Tutsis and moderate politicians by Hutu militias with government support. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany represents another devastating example of state-sponsored persecution.",
            "The remarkable impact of Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his enduring career and extraordinary talent for orchestral innovation. While his piano work often maintains a delicate presence in many compositions, his true genius manifested in creating intricate musical pieces that brilliantly showcased his musicians' individual talents. The maestro developed sophisticated frameworks allowing for both spontaneous improvisation and meticulously arranged segments, carefully tailored to highlight each performer's unique stylistic approach. This methodology resulted in distinctive orchestral signatures that perfectly complemented each composition's character. His profound understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to produce some of jazz's most groundbreaking compositions.\n\nAccording to Grove Music's scholarly analysis, compositions like \"Creole Love Call\" exemplify Ellington's pioneering approach to incorporating vocals as instrumental elements throughout his musical journey. This piece demonstrates his exceptional ability to enhance soloists' performances, a skill that remained constant throughout his career. The composition, structured as a measured twelve-bar blues, unfolds through six distinct choruses:\n\nInitial Chorus: Interplay between vocals and woodwinds, transitioning from fluid melody to textured timbre\nSecond Chorus: Dampened trumpet elaborating the core melody with extended blue notes\nThird Chorus: High-register clarinet solo floating above subtle syncopated piano\nFourth Chorus: Full orchestral interpretation featuring brass and reed section dialogue\nFifth Chorus: Climactic movement with high-register reed initiation backed by brass and rhythm\nFinal Chorus: Return to vocal-reed dialogue with instrumental-style vocal growls\nConclusion: Short vocal passage ending with dissonant trombone flourish\n\nThis innovative vocal incorporation represents just one facet of Ellington's distinctive musical vocabulary. Later works like \"Hot and Bothered\" showcase his masterful orchestration combined with tonal exploration, featuring remarkable interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scatting. Similarly, \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" demonstrates his brilliant utilization of Nanton's trombone prowess in establishing the melodic foundation.",
            "What mechanisms drive evolutionary patterns in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the boundaries that shape evolutionary trajectories. Nearly a century after D'Arcy Thompson lamented the lack of mathematical frameworks in biological form studies, this challenge persists. Contemporary research has made strides in applying quantitative approaches to understand mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution.\n\nOur research investigates Prunum specimens using mathematical frameworks combined with empirical observations. By analyzing X-ray images of various Prunum species, we extracted numerical parameters to construct both theoretical and actual shell configurations using CerioShell software. This approach enables us to explore the theoretical limits of morphological variation within this genus, complementing our laboratory studies to illuminate major evolutionary transitions.\n\nUnderstanding shell architecture requires recognizing it as a helical structure rotating through space. The spiral components, known as whorls, encircle a central columella. Shell growth patterns exhibit varying expansion rates, with distinct suture lines marking whorl boundaries. The final whorl, termed the body whorl, typically achieves the greatest diameter. Above it lies the spire, comprising earlier whorls, terminating in the apex. The base occupies the opposite end, featuring the aperture through which the organism extends.\n\nShell examination typically involves four perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard presentation shows the apertural view, displaying the opening while positioning the apex upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a systematic protocol. Beginning with an apical perspective, observers locate the initial suture point. A reference line bisects the shell, allowing whorl counts in quarter-turn increments from this starting point.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a sequence of apertures progressing through three-dimensional space during calcium carbonate deposition. This growth pattern can be mapped using aperture center coordinates and dimensional measurements.\n\nSuch spatial progressions yield both visual and mathematical representations. These models facilitate parameter manipulation, allowing exploration of alternative developmental pathways in mollusk shell formation.",
            "During the past decade, Indonesia's infant and newborn death rates have shown minimal fluctuation. Despite making progress on various Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation initiatives, the nation struggles significantly with improving maternal and child health metrics. These challenges, which will be examined in detail, suggest that strengthening the broader healthcare infrastructure might prove more beneficial than implementing targeted programs.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has achieved a 72% rate of professionally attended births, this statistic warrants closer scrutiny. Many of these attendants are traditional practitioners, including local midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications like severe bleeding during childbirth. Furthermore, recent data shows declining professional medical intervention rates for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions. The limited available information regarding post-birth care also indicates substantial inadequacies nationwide.\n\nSurgical birth procedures remain unexpectedly low at approximately 4% overall, with notable disparities between regions. Urban areas maintain a 7% cesarean delivery rate, while rural regions report only 2%, highlighting significant geographical healthcare inequities. Socioeconomic factors also play a crucial role, with a substantial 27% difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant healthcare metrics, policymakers face a fundamental choice between targeted interventions and comprehensive healthcare system reform. While specialized programs offer appealing advantages, including clearer objectives and quicker results, they present notable challenges. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health sectors, as evidenced by how international HIV/AIDS funding has impacted family planning initiatives. Moreover, multiple parallel programs frequently create redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, resulting in excessive bureaucratic procedures for resource allocation and management.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing an ever-growing array of musical styles and categories. Within this vast landscape, numerous primary genres - including hip-hop, rock, country, jazz, and folk music - have evolved into intricate networks of specialized subgenres. Perhaps most notably, Heavy Metal has emerged as an exceptionally rich and nuanced form of musical expression since its inception four decades ago. While often associated with darker emotional themes, Metal's versatility has allowed it to branch into countless distinctive variations, with new subgenres continuously emerging as artists explore its creative boundaries.\n\nContemporary Heavy Metal presents such a complex tapestry of musical styles that defining its essential characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has assimilated elements from various musical traditions, understanding its current form requires examining its origins. The genre represents more than just a musical category - it constitutes a genuine cultural movement.\n\nThe essence of Metal lies in its embrace of extremes. It pushes boundaries across multiple dimensions: amplification, instrumental virtuosity, theatrical presentation, and emotional intensity. Musicians within this genre typically demonstrate exceptional technical proficiency, setting it apart from more primitive musical forms. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic culture of the 1970s, when artists, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal introduced a raw, visceral quality previously absent from mainstream music, and later iterations drew inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic-era compositions. Consider the dark themes evident in \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of Heavy Metal's precursors. This Beatles track, created as a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier sound, demonstrated the band's ability to embrace darker, more intense musical elements, earning its place on their White Album.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, exemplifies both the literal representation of a woman experiencing a mystical dreamscape and the metaphorical manifestation of Rousseau's professional aspirations. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau grappled with the fundamental tension between conforming to established artistic conventions to gain acceptance and following his unique creative instincts.\n\nUnderstanding the context of Rousseau's life illuminates the significance of The Dream. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau emerged from a middle-class background, his father being a moderately successful hardware merchant. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau never received formal artistic training. Instead, he spent four decades working as a municipal toll collector, often mistakenly referred to as a customs officer. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - his first marriage to Clémence ended in profound sorrow, with the loss of eight children in infancy, leaving only his daughter Julia. Art became his sanctuary, a means of processing grief and seeking new purpose. His artistic perspective reflected his working-class origins, offering an authentic rather than romanticized view of ordinary life.\n\nThe timing of Rousseau's artistic career posed unique challenges. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of numerous accomplished modernist painters. Despite years of dedication, recognition eluded him until approximately the same period when Henri Matisse was establishing his reputation. The contrast between these contemporary artists was striking: while Matisse actively sought to revolutionize artistic expression, Rousseau paradoxically strived for conventional acceptance within the established art community, as noted by art critic Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters.",
            "The relationship between moral principles and artistic expression has long fascinated scholars and philosophers. This connection runs deeper than mere coincidence. While conventional wisdom suggests that learning primarily occurs through formal education or direct experience, our understanding of ethics and artistic beauty seems to develop through different channels. Instead of following prescribed rules, both fields focus on explaining why certain actions are considered moral or why particular works resonate as beautiful.\n\nWhen analyzing artistic or moral merit, we often encounter limitations in fully articulating their essence. Consider how art critics discuss masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - they might reference technical elements such as composition or historical significance, yet these explanations rarely capture the artwork's true impact. Similarly, when people describe their favorite artistic works, they frequently preface their analysis with phrases acknowledging an ineffable quality that defies complete explanation.\n\nThis parallel between artistic appreciation and moral understanding extends beyond surface-level similarities. Both domains possess an element that transcends conventional description or analysis. Literary works, in particular, demonstrate this phenomenon clearly - no matter how thoroughly we analyze their components, something intangible remains beyond our grasp. This elusive quality appears in both artistic expression and ethical understanding, suggesting a fundamental connection between these two spheres of human experience.\n\nThe intersection of morality and artistic expression becomes particularly evident in literature. Unlike other art forms, literature inherently incorporates moral dimensions that mirror life itself. Our engagement with literary works often centers on their value systems and ethical implications, making them uniquely positioned to explore and illuminate moral questions. This special characteristic of literature - its ability to engage with moral considerations while maintaining artistic merit - highlights the intrinsic connection between aesthetic and ethical understanding.",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a powerhouse nation, weaving together diverse regional identities from Munich's alpine surroundings to the northern maritime culture of Kiel. This cultural tapestry stretches across the nation, connecting cities like Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden's historic streets by the Elbe. The rich mosaic of contemporary German society reflects its complex origins, rooted in various ancient peoples and tribal confederations.\n\nThe ancestral homeland known as Germania has sparked considerable academic debate regarding its nomenclature. Historical records indicate multiple potential origins: the Tungri tribe theory proposed by Tacitus, Caesar's adoption of Gallic terminology during his campaigns, and linguistic connections to ancient weapons or behavioral characteristics. The term \"Germanus\" emerged prominently in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he documented frequent conflicts between Gallic peoples and tribes beyond the Rhine frontier.\n\nAncient documentation provides fascinating insights into Germania's early inhabitants. Tacitus's seminal work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (98 CE) presents a compelling argument for the indigenous nature of Germanic peoples, suggesting their isolation and distinctive character. He emphasized the region's challenging environment and questioned why anyone would willingly migrate to such harsh territory unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania remained primarily transactional. While Roman expeditions ventured into Germanic territories for resources and military campaigns, permanent Roman settlement proved limited. Germanic tribes established themselves as significant players along the empire's frontiers during the first century CE, engaging in trade and military service with Rome while maintaining their independence (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The resolution of such pretense often forces an uncomfortable choice between maintaining relationships and reclaiming one's true identity, as those deceived may react with varying degrees of acceptance or hostility.\n\nThe narrative particularly scrutinizes gender-based deception, raising fundamental questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine dress emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy inadvertently severs potential feminine alliances.\n\nThis masquerade generates unforeseen complications, notably Olivia's misplaced affections: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Furthermore, it creates an intricate emotional entanglement with Orsino, evidenced in his words: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nContemporary interpretations might view the play as an examination of how artifice can catalyze the emergence of latent desires, particularly regarding Olivia and Orsino's reactions to Viola's disguise. Their responses potentially suggest unexplored aspects of their own identities. However, Olivia's character appears more likely constructed as Shakespeare's commentary on superficial attraction rather than deeper identity questions. This interpretation gains credence through her swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her ultimate familial acceptance of Viola: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "Scholars have frequently highlighted the extreme measures employed in Germany's colonial territories, particularly regarding the systematic elimination of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, it would be an oversimplification to characterize the entire German colonial experience through this single lens. The empire's administrative approaches and educational initiatives varied substantially across its diverse territories.\n\nWhen British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) following World War I, they encountered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other territories by writers of the era. However, the educational landscape in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) told a markedly different story.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational framework established in East Africa, South West African authorities delegated native education almost exclusively to religious organizations, offering minimal governmental assistance. Conversely, substantial resources were allocated to European education in the territory, including state-run schools and enhanced support for missionary institutions serving white settlers. This educational disparity created lasting implications, with South West Africa's indigenous population remaining largely unschooled while other former German colonies produced numerous educated individuals.\n\nThe academic literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, though predominantly written in German during or shortly after colonial rule. Initial studies focused primarily on describing educational structures, while subsequent English-language research has offered comparative analyses and deeper exploration of specific educational aspects. Notable among these is Cohen's comparative study of South West and East African educational systems, which attributes many of South West Africa's distinctive educational characteristics to its substantial settler population.\n\nThe territory's relatively moderate climate, despite its predominantly desert landscape, attracted significant European settlement. By 1913, South West Africa hosted nearly 15,000 European residents, almost triple the white population of East Africa, the next most heavily settled German colony.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that characterized their relationship for nearly six decades (Diehl and Goerts 2000, 145). The relationship reached its most contentious point during the 1846-1848 conflict, when American forces conquered Mexican territories, including Texas and what would become the Southwest. Prior to World War I, numerous confrontations occurred between these neighboring nations, sparked by fundamental differences in faith, societal values, and competing national interests (Schmitt 1974, 30-31).\n\nSuch patterns of conflict often emerge between adjacent nations. Geographic proximity frequently breeds competition over resources and influence, as demonstrated by countless historical examples. Mexico and Cuba stand out as particularly noteworthy cases of sustained diplomatic tension with the United States, as noted by Pletcher (1977, 41). Their proximity to American shores has contributed to these strained relationships, contrasting sharply with the generally positive connections maintained with other Latin American nations.\n\nFaith-based divisions played a crucial role in the discord. Frahm (2001, 86) notes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchical rule in earlier centuries paralleled its later resistance to fascism and communism. Similar to how Cold War tensions combined ideological differences with practical concerns, religious disparities between Protestant America and Catholic Mexico intensified their rivalry. These religious tensions stemmed from historical Anglo-Spanish antagonisms, which the former colonies inherited and perpetuated.\n\nThroughout the 57-year period of rivalry, Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct conflicts. Border security dominated these disputes, with cross-border criminal activity causing significant diplomatic strain. Both nations eventually deployed military forces to address these frontier challenges (Schmitt 1974, 97).\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico's economic dependence on the United States grew. According to Schmitt (1974, 109-110), American priorities shifted from territorial acquisition to economic influence in Mexico during the late 1800s, fundamentally altering the relationship's dynamic.",
            "In 2008, a rare medical condition struck without warning, transforming my life overnight. At that juncture, I was employed in healthcare, a career path I had selected primarily for its perceived stability. Growing up, I frequently heard people say, \"Healthcare jobs will never disappear - illness is a constant.\" Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I opted for the practical route into nursing.\n\nThe reality hit hard at age 46: unmarried, minimal savings, and suddenly incapacitated. Currently, after a decade and a half of relying on disability benefits, my personal possessions have dwindled to almost nothing. Daily survival requires constant effort, challenging both my sense of security and dignity. While uncertainty permeates every aspect of my existence, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. When facing genuine hardship, even the strongest individuals feel vulnerable.\n\nLife's challenges, whether minor or major, are inevitable. Despite careful planning, certain obstacles prove insurmountable without assistance. While I acknowledge the need to reduce dependence on federal programs in America - given their obvious deterioration - I advocate for strengthening community bonds rather than promoting isolation.\n\nSome political figures glorify self-reliance as America's founding principle. However, historical evidence suggests that mutual aid, respect, and resource-sharing were the true cornerstones of early American survival. Consider the westward expansion - success depended on collective effort, not individual prowess.\n\nPreparation remains crucial. My emergency supplies include medical equipment, water treatment solutions, protective materials, illumination devices, and non-perishable food items. Those with available land should consider small-scale agriculture and food preservation. Alternative heating methods, where feasible, provide additional security.\n\nHowever, the most valuable preparation may be cultivating relationships within your community.",
            "Buddhism emerged when a noble heir, later recognized as the Buddha, experienced spiritual awakening during the 5th or 6th century BCE. His enlightenment and subsequent teachings gave rise to various Buddhist traditions, with Theravada emerging as the most traditional branch. As this spiritual movement approaches its 2500th anniversary, modern practitioners would hardly recognize its original form. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual observed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony embraced by both religious officials and everyday followers, despite having no direct connection to the Buddha's original teachings. Such evolution extends beyond mere customs, reaching into the fundamental principles of salvation and spiritual liberation.\n\nThe Buddhist framework has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, with both clergy and lay followers modifying their interpretations of core principles in response to various pressures. These catalysts for change can be categorized in several ways: those originating within versus outside the Buddhist community, and those intended to harm versus those that influence unintentionally.\n\nTo properly analyze these transformations, we must establish clear definitions. Changes originating from Buddhist practitioners, regardless of their status, represent internal influences. Conversely, modifications stemming from non-Buddhist sources constitute external influences. Harmful pressures actively seek to undermine Buddhist practices, while neutral influences may affect the tradition without specific intent to help or harm.\n\nTo understand these evolutionary forces, one must first grasp Buddhism's foundational principles. Adherents seek guidance through three sacred elements: the Buddha himself, his teachings (Dhamma), and the monastic community (Sangha). The Dhamma encompasses three collections of sacred texts: the Suttas (discourses), Vinaya (monastic regulations), and Abhidhamma (philosophical analyses). Key concepts include the absence of an eternal self (Anatta), life's inherent challenges (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Understanding these principles enables escape from the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and freedom from desire (lobha), aversion (dosa), and ignorance (moha). While monastics follow numerous regulations, lay practitioners observe five basic ethical guidelines regarding harmful actions, dishonesty, theft, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Central to all practice are the four noble truths, beginning with life's fundamental challenges, their origin in attachment, and the possibility of transcendence."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "When engaging in negotiations, cultural awareness emerges as a critical factor. The concept of culture resists simple categorization; it manifests as a complex tapestry of behaviors, beliefs, and practices. Sweeping generalizations about national characteristics—for instance, attributing specific traits to entire populations—often miss the nuanced reality of human interaction. Instead, successful negotiators focus on understanding how cultural elements specifically influence the dynamics at the bargaining table.\n\nIndividuals naturally view unfamiliar cultures through the lens of their own experiences. To bridge cultural gaps effectively, one must invest time in understanding the target culture's historical context and inherent biases. Success in cross-cultural negotiations demands acceptance rather than criticism, particularly when operating from a position of limited leverage. This principle becomes especially relevant when conducting business in unfamiliar territories, where respecting local customs can facilitate breakthrough moments.\n\nCultural considerations extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its distinctive environment, manifesting in various ways—from workplace timing expectations to dress requirements. These differences appear in multiple aspects: communication preferences, organizational hierarchies, and recruitment strategies. Even within single organizations, notable variations exist across different locations and settings. While some societies might present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals underlying complexities.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides crucial insight into cultural motivations. In environments prioritizing group harmony and reputation preservation, negotiators typically avoid actions that might compromise organizational or leadership standing. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may pursue aggressive bargaining strategies. While these broad cultural patterns merit consideration, developing personal connections with negotiating counterparts often proves equally valuable for achieving optimal outcomes.",
            "When examining theological discourse, we encounter a fascinating quote from Psalms that declares \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This declaration appears prominently in both biblical text and philosophical arguments, particularly those of Anselm and Aquinas. In analyzing their respective positions on divine existence, we must establish parameters. Given that both philosophers advocate for the Christian deity specifically, our comparative analysis should focus on their methodologies rather than debating which conception of divinity they defend. However, despite their earnest attempts, neither thinker provides an entirely satisfactory framework for establishing God's existence.\n\nAnselm's methodology centers on internal contemplation and rational deduction. His argument posits that divine existence can be demonstrated through pure reason and self-reflection. The core of his thesis suggests that because we can conceptualize a perfect being, such a being must necessarily exist, as existence itself is a form of perfection. This introspective approach relies heavily on mental exercises and logical constructs, eschewing external validation in favor of intellectual meditation.\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions an empirical approach, developing five distinct pathways to prove God's existence through observable phenomena. His methodology would particularly appeal to skeptics and those requiring tangible evidence, as it builds upon natural observation rather than abstract reasoning. Aquinas presents arguments based on motion, causation, necessity, gradation, and design. His framework resembles solving a jigsaw puzzle - by understanding the shape of what's missing, one can deduce the nature of the absent piece without direct observation. This empirically-grounded approach stands in marked contrast to Anselm's contemplative methodology.",
            "Literary authors employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. In examining \"The Great Gatsby,\" we observe how effectively its creator manipulates language and symbolism to achieve desired effects. One notable approach involves unconventional pairing of descriptive words with objects, creating unexpected associations. However, perhaps more intriguing is the deliberate use of color symbolism throughout the narrative.\n\nThe novel demonstrates particular mastery in its deployment of chromatic imagery, especially through shades like amber, emerald, ivory/slate, and crimson/rose. These carefully chosen hues serve as recurring motifs, carrying deeper significance beyond mere visual description. Of particular interest is the author's handling of ivory/slate and crimson/rose tones, which develop distinct connotations as the story progresses.\n\nThe ivory/slate spectrum emerges as a powerful metaphor for conformity and social stratification. Ivory suggests refinement and privilege, while slate conveys aging and diminished glory. This dichotomy manifests throughout the narrative: socialites routinely appear in ivory attire, from the protagonist's casual wear at gatherings to secondary characters' everyday dress. The sole deviation occurs during the notorious party scene, where vivid primary colors dominate instead.\n\nThese neutral tones extend beyond fashion to characterize environments and individuals alike. Urban landscapes feature ivory canyons of architecture, while social registers contain slate-colored names of party attendees. Even residential descriptions emphasize this palette, with apartments described as segments of a massive ivory structure. Common folk and ordinary settings consistently receive these neutral descriptors: childhood memories, vehicles, landscapes, and various background characters all bear these understated hues.\n\nOnce established, this color symbolism becomes instrumental in character development, particularly regarding the female love interest. Her consistent association with ivory tones gradually transforms her from a dynamic character into a symbol of societal conformity, representing an idealized yet ultimately uniform object of desire.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local producers cultivate an impressive array of crops, ranging from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh herbs and seasonal berries. The region's thriving organic agriculture sector experiences unprecedented demand, evidenced by extensive waitlists for community-supported farming initiatives. Beyond traditional farming, these establishments frequently serve as educational venues, offering guided tours and recreational opportunities like nature walks and wildlife observation.\n\nThe transition to organic farming methods presents both opportunities and challenges for agricultural entrepreneurs. While organic practices foster enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem health through chemical-free cultivation, they demand significant investment in manual labor and innovative pest management strategies. Smaller organic operations often struggle to achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by conventional farms, necessitating creative approaches to revenue generation.\n\nThis case study examines a 160-acre property situated near Potrero, California, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land encompasses diverse ecosystems, including chaparral, Mediterranean grassland (non-indigenous), and oak woodland habitats. This location falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone, as defined by San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The area serves as habitat for numerous protected species, including the imperiled Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher, among others facing population decline.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples inhabited this region for generations before ranchers and wood merchants established themselves in the nineteenth century. The property's origins as a homestead suggest its historical use for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis explores potential governmental support programs available to small-scale farmers interested in balancing agricultural productivity with wildlife conservation, using an existing organic operation in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection, particularly between brothers - a connection that transcends ordinary relationships and encompasses a spectrum of powerful emotions. From affection to rivalry, from admiration to resentment, these feelings intertwine in complex patterns. When brothers look at each other, they often glimpse reflections of themselves, and this mirror effect becomes most pronounced during times of crisis. The true test of brotherly bonds emerges in moments of extreme pressure, revealing either nobility or darkness within their relationship. These revelations often come at significant personal cost, as the consequences of brotherhood-driven actions ripple through their lives.\n\nThis intricate dynamic is masterfully portrayed in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where readers witness the relationship between two siblings unfold against a richly detailed Southern backdrop. The story traces their journey - both literal and metaphorical - through a landscape as complex as their relationship. The narrative reaches its peak in a dramatic confrontation where fraternal pride collides with devastating reality, ultimately claiming one brother's life. Through careful character development and first-person narration, the author reveals the elder brother's complicated emotional landscape and his perception of the world around him.\n\nThe older brother's character arc revolves primarily around his overwhelming sense of pride. His relationship with Doodle, his younger sibling, is colored by persistent disappointment from their earliest interactions. He had envisioned teaching a brother the quintessential childhood activities - breath-holding contests, sprinting across fields, scaling vines in Old Woman Swamp, and racing to Horsehead Landing. He longed for a companion to share adventures with, particularly someone to join him in his favorite perch atop the towering pine behind their barn. These aspirations proved impossible due to Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival and permanently limited his physical capabilities. This harsh reality so devastated the protagonist that he briefly contemplated a horrifying solution - suffocation with a pillow. Yet, this dark impulse dissolved instantly when confronted with Doodle's innocent smile, revealing that beneath his disappointment lay an innate, unshakeable brotherly love.",
            "Our neural architecture represents an intricate system capable of processing vast amounts of data while exhibiting remarkable creativity. Throughout history, scholars have drawn parallels between the mind and contemporary innovations of their time - from ancient writing surfaces to modern computational devices. However, one must exercise caution when employing such analogies, as they often fall short of capturing the brain's true complexity.\n\nNeural processing initiates when our sensory receptors convert environmental stimuli into neural signals. These signals undergo dual processing mechanisms: ascending pathways compile basic sensory data, while descending pathways facilitate rapid interpretation based on existing knowledge. Consider observing a dark square against a light field - ascending processes identify elementary features like edges and contrast, while descending processes aid in determining whether we're viewing a solid object or a void.\n\nThe neural gateway of attention determines which signals merit deeper cognitive engagement. This filtering mechanism explains why we might overlook countless environmental details - such as individual grass blades beneath our feet - yet instantly recognize our name in crowded environments. This selective process occurs continuously throughout various stages of cognitive processing.\n\nData storage within neural networks occurs through multiple memory systems. These include immediate sensory registers, temporary working storage, and permanent neural archives. The encoding process varies by input type - linguistic information, for instance, may be stored based on visual appearance, acoustic properties, or meaning. Research suggests temporary memory maintenance involves neural circuits sustaining electrical activity for approximately twenty seconds, while long-term storage likely depends on protein structural modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks explaining neural knowledge organization. These theories draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent model suggests information exists as interconnected conceptual nodes - similar to a web where related concepts (like \"furniture,\" \"wood,\" and \"dining\") form natural associations.",
            "The devastating economic collapse of 2007 marked a turning point in American financial history. As millions lost their jobs, homeowners faced foreclosure, and major financial institutions crumbled, the nation grappled with an unprecedented crisis that continues to influence policy decisions today. The root causes trace back to a complex web of misguided financial practices, particularly the widespread distribution of high-risk mortgages within an inadequately regulated system. Financial giants, including government-sponsored enterprises, engaged in questionable practices involving mortgage derivatives, ultimately triggering a domino effect when borrowers began defaulting en masse.\n\nThe seeds of destruction were planted during the late 1990s, when political motivations led to significant changes in lending policies. Contemporary journalism captured this shift, with notable coverage from The New York Times highlighting how Fannie Mae faced mounting pressure to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. These prescient reports warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to previous financial sector bailouts.\n\nThe crisis's complexity deepened through innovative but risky financial instruments. Financial markets embraced sophisticated mortgage products and derivatives, creating an intricate web of dependencies throughout the economy. This interconnectedness left the entire system vulnerable to fluctuations in housing prices, as households and institutions accumulated unprecedented levels of debt exposure to real estate.\n\nThe eventual market correction proved catastrophic. Major investment banks, collectively holding mortgage-related obligations worth nearly one-third of America's GDP, faced existential threats. The landscape of American finance transformed dramatically: prestigious institutions either collapsed or underwent forced acquisitions, while others abandoned their investment banking status to survive under stricter regulatory frameworks. Government-sponsored enterprises, bearing the weight of trillions in mortgage obligations, ultimately required federal intervention to prevent complete collapse.",
            "Let's discuss the perils of information dumps in storytelling. Writers often face a temptation to unleash torrents of background details, believing they're crafting intricate narrative tapestries. However, this approach frequently backfires, leading readers to disengage or abandon the story entirely. Even experienced authors sometimes catch themselves drowning their narratives in excessive detail.\n\nInformation dumping is a narrative pitfall.\n\nWhile most writers understand the fundamental principle of demonstrating rather than explaining, it's remarkably easy to slip into lengthy descriptive passages where action stagnates or becomes overwhelming. This tendency often manifests as an internal struggle between two competing urges: the desire to establish context quickly versus the impulse to elaborate on every minute detail of character backgrounds.\n\nInformation dumping occurs when writers explicitly state background information instead of weaving it naturally into the narrative. In cinema, this manifests as dialogue-heavy scenes where characters unnaturally explain situations to each other. Literary works face similar challenges when authors resort to direct exposition.\n\nConsider this scenario: A narrative briefly summarizes a couple's entire relationship - their meeting, wedding, and the tragic murder of the spouse - in just two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach deprives readers of crucial emotional connections. Instead, the story should illustrate the husband's devotion through his actions and words, demonstrate how the relationship transformed both characters, and allow readers to form genuine attachments to these individuals. This investment makes the tragedy more impactful and reveals deeper insights into the surviving character's personality.\n\nEssentially, narratives require substance beyond basic plot points.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly catalogue character details. For instance, when introducing a former Air Force servicemember who now manages a gas station at night, has two failed marriages, enjoys fishing, harbors entrepreneurial ambitions, and maintains specific breakfast preferences, these details deserve thoughtful integration rather than immediate disclosure.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable broadcasts on NBC 4. The morning programming began with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended an individual following an assault on his spouse involving multiple stab wounds. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the situation.\n\nSubsequently, the broadcast covered an incident involving an 18-year-old victim of gun violence in the Sharon Woods district. The coverage appeared notably brief despite the severity of the incident and ongoing SWAT involvement. This observation raises questions about potential disparities in media coverage based on demographic factors, as I've noted a pattern of abbreviated reporting when victims belong to minority communities.\n\nThe broadcast continued with details regarding an aviation incident involving a medical transport helicopter that sustained damage from what investigators determined to be a .22 caliber projectile. Authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to the perpetrator's identification.\n\nWeather coverage followed, albeit briefly, highlighting anticipated precipitation and moderate temperatures for the weekend period. The concise nature of this segment appeared strategically designed to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe program also reported on a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, with what seemed to be disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's physical characteristics and racial identity. The final segment detailed the conviction of a narcotics distributor responsible for interstate trafficking operations, with an unusual presentation of the sentence duration in months rather than years, and arguably unnecessary emphasis on the individual's ethnic background.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. These investment vehicles mirror various market segments while offering advantages typically associated with individual stocks, including short-selling opportunities, margin trading, and single-share purchasing options. Despite providing these sophisticated features, ETFs maintain surprisingly competitive cost structures, with management fees significantly below typical mutual fund rates.\n\nInvestors should note certain trade-offs, particularly the requirement to pay brokerage commissions on transactions, similar to stock trades. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across numerous sectors and asset classes. However, prudent investors must conduct thorough due diligence regarding marketed advantages such as portfolio diversification, carefully assessing both their presence and magnitude.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the healthcare ETF designated as IHF, comparing its characteristics against its primary constituent stocks. Our investigation aims to determine whether holding the ETF provides comparable benefits to maintaining positions in its major components, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns or absolute performance.\n\nGiven practical constraints, our examination concentrates on the fund's top ten holdings, which constitute approximately 63.58% of total assets. These positions serve as our analytical foundation.\n\nTo assess how effectively these major components reflect the complete IHF portfolio, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the resulting portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns. Our computational framework is detailed in the accompanying data.\n\nInitial findings reveal intriguing disparities: a hypothetical portfolio comprising solely these primary holdings generates returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points, representing a 16% performance differential. Additionally, this concentrated portfolio exhibits reduced market sensitivity, with a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. While these preliminary results suggest potential advantages in holding the individual components, we must consider whether these differences achieve statistical significance.\n\nTo address this question, we analyzed the standard deviations of the constituent stocks, normalizing these values for direct comparison with the ETF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter participation during the project's third month. Multiple factors likely contributed to this decline. The harsh New England winter climate naturally discourages cycling and walking commuters. Additionally, December's academic pressures, including final examinations and grading periods, combined with holiday preparations and extended breaks, may have reduced participation. The late January resumption of classes also correlates with diminished log submissions. However, these factors alone cannot fully explain February's unexpectedly low participation rates.\n\nSuch initiatives often demonstrate strong initial enthusiasm followed by waning engagement. To counter this pattern, our team implemented a focused \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, successfully boosting participation rates. This experience highlighted two key operational challenges: sustaining momentum despite natural engagement decline, and adapting to academic calendar disruptions inherent to educational institutions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative transportation initiatives lies in American society's deep-rooted automotive culture, which values personal mobility and convenience. Our incentive strategy included distributing various gift certificates to local establishments - restaurants, cafes, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating progressively valuable rewards might have better sustained participation. While initial gift card offerings proved adequate, introducing more substantial prizes - such as premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - could have prevented participation decline. A tiered reward structure, announcing increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project timeline, might have maintained or even enhanced engagement levels instead of experiencing the observed downturn.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I explored their collection of early Edison trick films, encompassing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces demonstrate the innovative use of editing techniques to create magical illusions. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unexpected deviations in these early cinematic experiments.\n\nThe majority of these productions adhered to specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a static camera positioned like a theatrical audience, and maintained consistent distance from their subjects. Most significantly, they typically consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous take. However, as the new century dawned, several bold filmmakers began challenging these established norms by incorporating multiple distinct scenes.\n\nWhat stands out immediately is the theatrical staging of these productions. The camera remains stationary, as if representing an audience member's fixed perspective, while the action unfolds within a defined performance space. This approach clearly reflects the influence of stage performances, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where performers move laterally across the frame, never approaching or retreating from the viewing position - much like actors confined to a physical stage.\n\nThis theatrical influence extends to shot composition as well. The films consistently employ wide and occasional medium-distance views, completely avoiding close-range shots. This mirrors the live theater experience, where audiences observe the entire stage simultaneously. The performers maintain their distance from the camera, preserving the illusion of watching a stage production.\n\nThese early works typically presented what seemed to be one continuous scene, usually lasting no more than sixty seconds. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, resulting in brief, vaudeville-style demonstrations focusing on magical transformations and disappearances rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that many of these apparently continuous scenes actually comprised multiple shots cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful examination reveals the precise moment where separate shots were combined to create the illusion.",
            "Literary scholars often note the fascinating contradiction inherent in Gothic fiction's nomenclature, as it represents a fusion of antiquated and contemporary elements. This genre has experienced varying degrees of critical reception throughout history, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.' When Horace Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, widely acknowledged as the first Gothic novel, he deliberately merged classical romantic conventions with modern narrative techniques, establishing a groundbreaking literary framework.\n\nThe term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations even during Otranto's publication era, referencing diverse cultural and architectural elements from medieval periods. Despite being considered somewhat primitive compared to contemporary literary developments, the genre's unique combination of theatrical elements and psychological depth has granted it remarkable staying power, allowing it to feel simultaneously dated and fresh to modern readers.\n\nMedieval chivalric traditions play a central role in Gothic literature's thematic foundation. In Otranto, these ideals undergo both preservation and transformation. The emphasis on chivalric values reflects a broader cultural commentary, as authors like Walpole observed what they perceived as moral decay in their contemporary society. Writing during politically turbulent times, Walpole's work suggests a nostalgic yearning for the perceived moral certainties of medieval times.\n\nThis perspective manifests clearly in characters such as Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. His characterization as a noble prince who endures hardship and faces presumed death at the hands of non-believers exemplifies the genre's tendency toward melodramatic excess while maintaining core chivalric ideals. This portrayal demonstrates how Gothic fiction often amplified traditional heroic qualities to create its distinctive atmosphere.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer orders through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first articulated by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, describes a comprehensive framework for orchestrating and monitoring supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements efficiently. The discipline rests on six fundamental pillars: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock management, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodology of production processes. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the most reliable indicator of demand patterns. Upon completing market research and gaining clarity on consumer requirements, decision-makers can determine product specifications and production volumes. Subsequently, they select optimal manufacturing locations based on capacity requirements and quality standards, while maintaining focus on consumer satisfaction metrics. The final manufacturing considerations involve workflow scheduling and equipment maintenance protocols. The manufacturing phase demands meticulous attention to detail, as oversights can result in significant financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized procedures - from dress codes to receiving protocols - facilitate smooth operations.\n\nResource procurement, the second pillar, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Organizations often maintain multiple production divisions for single product lines, each equipped with specialized machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division assignments for various production phases. Additionally, they may opt for external partnerships to enhance velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while achieving or preserving cost efficiencies.",
            "The literary landscape of Victorian England was dominated by narratives that meticulously detailed aristocratic life. However, two notable exceptions, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, deviate significantly from these conventions. These works distinguish themselves through their incorporation of supernatural elements and unconventional storytelling techniques, which serve to illuminate their characters' psychological depths and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (220)\n\nThese narratives frequently employ dream sequences as a literary device, though each author adapts this technique to their specific narrative purposes. In Oliver Twist, these surreal interludes function as windows into the protagonist's psyche, revealing his innermost turmoil and growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this effectively. The dreamlike recollection emphasizes his powerlessness while highlighting his deteriorating physical state, particularly through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting scene's sensory overload - where Oliver barely registers the \"unseen hand\" guiding him - underscores his complete disorientation. This persistent pain, now intertwined with fear rather than initial shock, suggests deeper psychological implications. The sequence raises questions about agency and fate, as Oliver's passive response indicates potential psychological manipulation by Fagin, who may have successfully instilled a sense of helplessness in the young protagonist.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my time as an elementary school tutor, I encountered a memorable situation that highlighted a significant educational challenge. While assisting students with various subjects, particularly reading and English, I was asked to help a third-grade student named Adrian. His reading difficulties presented an unusual pattern - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly but struggled inexplicably with others.\n\nDespite being from a Latino background, Adrian's spoken English was impeccable. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his mother while supervising remaining students during a field trip day. She communicated exclusively in Spanish, and through my basic Spanish skills, we managed a conversation. This interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's reading challenges stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than comprehension issues.\n\nThis experience illuminates the complexities of language barriers in California's educational system. It demonstrates how language-related challenges can manifest in unexpected ways - even students with excellent verbal English skills may struggle with written language. While Adrian's situation required focused alphabet and pronunciation tutoring, many students face more substantial language barriers requiring comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe educational system needs a multi-faceted approach combining various strategies: dual-language programs, mainstream immersion, individualized tutoring, and ESL classes. Research demonstrates that two-way bilingual education programs yield superior academic results for all participants, not just non-native English speakers. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual might be impractical, incorporating bilingual educational support staff could create more inclusive and effective learning environments. This approach would benefit both English learners and native English speakers, fostering a more comprehensive educational experience.",
            "Since ancient times, humans have grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. Various paths lead to spiritual enlightenment: some find solace in churches, others in synagogues, while many seek answers through introspection. Though numerous individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions, others steadfastly reject such notions, embracing a more self-centered worldview. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems, sometimes discarding one for another. Each person's quest for meaning follows a unique trajectory, like countless paths leading toward illumination.\n\nI remember a conversation with Dad during a stormy afternoon. We were sheltered on the porch, cigarettes in hand, listening to raindrops drumming against the metal roofing. \"Cardinals,\" he answered when I inquired about his preferred avian species. Water cascaded from the gutters, drenching the botanical border below. His gaze wandered across the misty landscape, appearing both present and distant. Disease had ravaged his frame; clothing hung loose where it once fit snugly, and his formerly thick hair had grown sparse. Words about mortality remained unspoken between us - acknowledging them would make everything too tangible. Instead, I shifted closer, embracing him briefly before joining his contemplative watch of the summer shower.\n\nHis departure came in December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. Medical interventions prolonged his life beyond predictions, though their merit seemed questionable given his extended suffering. My faith wavered; the concept of a benevolent deity became increasingly difficult to reconcile with such cruel reality. Nighttime brought no comfort through prayer - any divine presence felt distant and indifferent.\n\nI made a conscious choice to avoid witnessing his final moments. Understanding him as intimately as I did, I knew he wouldn't want his child present for that transition. I chose to preserve memories of his vitality rather than his decline. While others gathered, I remained isolated in my bedroom for three days, awaiting inevitable news.\n\nThe silence of my phone spoke volumes.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideology stood John Taylor of Caroline, whose agricultural background and limited political experience shaped his passionate advocacy for individual liberties and governmental reform. His agricultural roots fundamentally influenced his perspectives on governance, sovereignty, constitutional matters, and judicial frameworks.\n\nThe absence of entrenched traditions in America presented, according to Taylor, an unprecedented opportunity to establish genuine self-governance. He emphasized the interconnected nature of human rights, arguing that these fundamental liberties must remain untouchable by governmental authority. In his view, while primitive societies might reward physical strength and cunning manipulation, civilized nations must transcend such base dynamics.\n\nTaylor's political philosophy centered on crafting governmental structures that could effectively manage humanity's moral dualism. His framework identified positive principles as those supporting private ownership, agricultural development, and resistance to unchecked capitalism. He theorized that properly designed systems would function effectively despite the inevitable human tendencies toward self-interest and personal gain. While acknowledging self-interest as a universal motivator, Taylor distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nRegarding constitutional interpretation, Taylor advocated for precise adherence while emphasizing contextual understanding. He supported minimal federal authority, limiting it strictly to explicitly granted powers, viewing extensive federal control as potentially tyrannical and financially burdensome. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true founding document, believing it better reflected the sovereign nature of individual states rather than a unified nation.",
            "My eyes fixed upon the scene below, processing the visual input with clinical detachment. Like a computer scanning data, my brain registered the information without emotional interference, maintaining a professional distance from what lay before me. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness like fireflies on a summer evening, there and gone in an instant.\n\nI recalled my brief foray into artistic pursuits several years ago. A colleague had recommended Betty Edwards' celebrated instruction manual on drawing. The book's methodology included a fascinating technique of using viewfinders to isolate portions of complex scenes, effectively simplifying the visual chaos into manageable segments.\n\nBut in this moment, no such mental framing device could help compartmentalize what I witnessed. The sight commanded my full attention, demanding acknowledgment in its raw entirety. Just as the great masters had their signature palettes – Van Gogh's yellows, Vermeer's blues – before me lay the foundation of what could only be termed a masterwork in sepia tones.\n\nWith surgical precision, I initiated the first phase of my task. The porcelain canvas reflected the fluorescent lights above as water circulated in its pristine dance. Particles separated from the main mass, swept away in the current. A second, more forceful attempt at the lever yielded similar results – the stubborn creation remained steadfast in its position.\n\nThere I stood, in my retail uniform, contemplating the unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron of our establishment's facilities. After several unsuccessful attempts to restore order through conventional means, I resigned myself to more direct intervention. Methodically wrapping protective layers around my hand, I prepared for the inevitable. Like a surgeon approaching a delicate procedure, I leaned forward, extending my arm toward the waiting basin...",
            "Recent data reveals an alarming trend in vehicular fatalities among young drivers. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates that adolescent neural development significantly impacts driving capability. Moreover, the fundamental lack of road experience contributes substantially to various driving mishaps, from basic control issues to severe accidents.\n\nStudies, particularly one conducted by researchers at the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, highlight a concerning correlation between passenger age demographics and collision frequency. This finding becomes especially relevant when considering typical adolescent social patterns.\n\nWhile various jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing systems that restrict nighttime driving and passenger numbers, these solutions merely scratch the surface. Evidence suggests that fundamental neurological and behavioral patterns make young drivers inherently more susceptible to dangerous driving behaviors.\n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman's research, featured in USA Today, indicates that risk-taking behaviors peak during late adolescence, suggesting that even eighteen might be premature for full driving privileges. This insight becomes particularly relevant as demographic projections indicate a substantial increase in eligible young drivers, specifically children of Baby-Boomers approaching driving age.\n\nA potential solution lies in standardizing national driving requirements. This approach would maintain educational components while implementing more stringent age restrictions. The framework could incorporate existing state-level requirements - such as California's mandated training hours - into a comprehensive national standard. This proposal builds upon established practices rather than introducing entirely new concepts.\n\nCurrent data spanning multiple states indicates that a unified approach could significantly reduce youth driving fatalities. By implementing evidence-based restrictions and standardized training requirements, we could better protect our young population while maintaining necessary mobility options.",
            "In exploring Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), three fundamental aspects deserve attention. The initial segment explores the basic nature of this condition, followed by an examination of diagnostic procedures and warning signs. The discussion concludes by addressing practical strategies educators can implement to support CAPD students in mainstream educational settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, alternatively known as APD, represents a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes auditory signals. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's 2005 report, this condition impacts the central nervous system's ability to effectively utilize sound information. Notably, individuals with CAPD maintain normal hearing capabilities but struggle with processing auditory input, such as distinguishing speech from ambient noise or processing individual words within conversations.\n\nHistorical records trace the disorder's recognition to mid-twentieth century studies. Initially termed \"auditory imperception,\" CAPD garnered attention when researchers examined communication disorders in children. Significant developments emerged in 1954 through pioneering work by Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari. Later advances came from Kimura's 1961 introduction of dichotic testing methodologies. A watershed moment occurred in 1977 when a national symposium catalyzed extensive research initiatives.\n\nCAPD symptoms encompass various challenges. Affected individuals might struggle with sound localization, experience difficulty distinguishing between concurrent sounds, or fail to recognize acoustic patterns. Additional manifestations include challenges in detecting vocal nuances that convey meaning, such as sarcastic tones. Some patients experience auditory masking, where subsequent sounds override previous ones. Furthermore, individuals might face challenges in processing sound information sequentially or synthesizing acoustic information meaningfully.\n\nDiagnostic procedures typically involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments incorporate behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. Currently, no singular diagnostic tool definitively confirms CAPD, and its underlying causes remain uncertain. Contemporary testing methods often employ simultaneous auditory stimuli, requiring patients to differentiate specific elements like word sequences or numerical patterns. Advanced diagnostic techniques include analyzing inner ear acoustic responses to various signals.",
            "My aspiration to join the Division of Family and Children Services stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for vulnerable youth and support families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation was not straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with personal challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping strategies. These observations guided me toward completing my Psychology degree at Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse. This experience catalyzed my involvement in a situation where I leveraged my psychology background to mediate between law enforcement and the youth's parents. The parents' dismissive attitude toward what they termed \"simple\" disputes revealed the critical need for professional intervention in family dynamics, solidifying my resolve to pursue social work.\n\nMy dedication to social justice extends beyond professional aspirations. Contemporary society presents a paradox: while claiming to value individuality, it often promotes conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I actively challenged societal norms through various forms of self-expression - from unconventional appearance choices to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA participation. My commitment to combating discrimination and promoting equality remains unwavering. This dedication to authentic self-expression and advocacy for marginalized communities continues to drive my professional pursuits in social work.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through both biological and sociocultural perspectives. While biological frameworks emphasize hereditary and medical factors, sociocultural approaches examine how environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables, impact sleep patterns.\n\nSleep disorders fall into several distinct categories. The first encompasses primary sleep disorders, followed by those connected to existing mental health conditions, and finally, those stemming from other causes. Primary sleep disorders branch into two subcategories: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Mental health-related sleep disturbances typically connect to either Axis I or Axis II conditions, while other sleep issues may result from medical conditions or substance use.\n\nWithin the Dyssomnia category, we find several conditions: Primary Insomnia (difficulty sleeping), Primary Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), Narcolepsy (involving cataplexy and REM irregularities), Breathing-Related Sleep Issues, Circadian Rhythm Disruptions, and unspecified cases. Parasomnias, on the other hand, manifest as behavioral or physiological anomalies during sleep, including nightmares, night terrors, sleepwalking, and other unclassified conditions.\n\nRecent research has revealed fascinating biological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Scientists have identified specific neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin that control sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with mice have demonstrated that GABAB receptors on these neurons play a crucial role in sleep regulation. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, sleep was promoted, while GABAB agonists increased overall sleep duration. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep patterns and hereditary sleep disorders, highlighting how genetic factors might influence an individual's ability to maintain healthy sleep patterns without pharmaceutical intervention.",
            "After spending five semesters at University Park, I've gained considerable perspective on the transportation challenges that plague our expanding campus. During my initial year, I resided in Stuart Hall within East Halls complex - a location that sits at the campus's eastern periphery. The journey to central campus locations, such as Willard building, could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nThe campus landscape has undergone significant transformation recently. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls once stood isolated, separated from main campus by vast empty spaces. Now, those areas house athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, plus numerous residential developments. This expansion has only intensified the challenge of campus navigation.\n\nIn addressing these mobility issues, bicycles emerge as the optimal solution for university environments. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after abandoning it for several years. Their enthusiasm was palpable as they noted, \"It's remarkable how cycling has regained its practical appeal - it's truly the most effective transportation method available.\" Beyond its health advantages, cycling represents unprecedented efficiency in human-powered transportation, with minimal fuel requirements beyond basic nutrition.\n\nAs an off-campus resident situated at a distance comparable to some university housing, I can attest to cycling's benefits. My daily commute to Thomas building, typically a 25-minute walk, reduces to merely 5 minutes by bicycle. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my academic schedule demands greater efficiency. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 150 minutes weekly when considering various campus destinations - proves invaluable for maintaining academic and personal commitments.",
            "In his seminal work Brave New World, Huxley presents a haunting vision of society's future, where technological advancement and unbridled consumerism converge to create a nightmarish dystopia. The society depicted prioritizes collective harmony over individual identity, systematically programming its inhabitants to chase fleeting pleasures rather than meaningful fulfillment. These citizens, unknowingly manipulated by the shadowy World Controller, become mere instruments in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about industrial and economic systems of the era. The novel employs classic Marxist concepts - from collective consciousness to social stratification - to highlight the author's growing unease with contemporary societal developments.\n\nThe narrative particularly emphasizes the concept of manufactured consent, where citizens remain blissfully unaware of their true economic relationships. Through sophisticated conditioning techniques, particularly hypnopædia, the lower castes (Deltas, Gammas) are programmed to embrace consumerist behaviors, perpetually pursuing material satisfaction. This manipulation, orchestrated by the World Controller, exemplifies social dominance theory, where elite groups maintain control through subtle yet pervasive means. The higher castes (Alphas, Betas), despite their enhanced cognitive capabilities, largely accept this system, with few exceptions like Bernard questioning the status quo.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the novel's portrayal of human connections - or rather, their absence. Characters appear deliberately two-dimensional, suggesting that technological progress and consumer culture have stripped humanity of its emotional depth. Authentic love is notably absent; instead, relationships are reduced to superficial physical encounters, with men objectifying women's \"pneumatic\" qualities and women casually discussing their liaisons. This emotional flatness, combined with each caste's acceptance of their predetermined role, illustrates how consumer capitalism creates a docile population, content to fulfill their prescribed social functions while maintaining the illusion of personal satisfaction.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that delved into Islamic studies. A recurring theme throughout the semester centered on the perception of Islam in contemporary society. This discussion has only grown more significant in our current political climate. The media's portrayal of Islam has undergone a remarkable transformation since the early 2000s, shifting from overt skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation. This evolution in public sentiment perhaps culminated in the unprecedented candidacy of a presidential hopeful with Islamic familial connections.\n\nThe historical accounts of the Prophet's life present fascinating contradictions that warrant closer examination. Traditional historical records suggest a figure who expanded his influence through military conquest and mandatory religious conversion. However, the biographical texts paint a markedly different picture - one of a misunderstood spiritual leader whose followers came to him voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nWhat stands out particularly are the parallel narratives between Islamic and Christian traditions. One notable example describes the multiplication of food to feed a multitude, bearing striking resemblance to well-documented Christian miracles. This apparent mirroring of sacred events raises questions about the authenticity and originality of these accounts.\n\nThe biographical sources frequently employ a distinctive narrative technique, relying heavily on chains of oral transmission to establish credibility. While this methodology aims to validate the accounts through multiple attestations, it paradoxically introduces elements of uncertainty due to the extended chain of narrators separating the events from their documentation.\n\nThe disparity between historical evidence and biographical portrayal creates a significant cognitive dissonance. While the biographical accounts present an image of a benevolent and humble leader, historical records suggest a more complex figure who employed various means to establish and maintain authority. This raises important questions about historical accuracy and contemporary understanding within the Islamic community.",
            "Historical analysis reveals a substantial divergence between the original teachings of Jesus and subsequent Christian theological developments. This evolution of Christian doctrine demonstrates an increasing departure from its foundational principles. Contemporary society exhibits remarkable progress in understanding and questioning traditional religious interpretations. Although conservative elements persist in maintaining conventional interpretations, their influence appears to be diminishing within the broader social context.\n\nScholars anticipate a significant surge in historical consciousness among Christian communities. This awakening will likely foster a desire to separate later theological additions from Jesus's original message. While this transformation may span generations, its culmination appears inevitable: Christianity will experience a fundamental restructuring, gravitating toward its historical roots. This movement will systematically deconstruct accumulated doctrinal layers, ultimately revealing Jesus's pure theological vision, unencumbered by subsequent interpretations.\n\nAs this theological reformation sweeps across Western societies, inspiring congregations to embrace practices reminiscent of first-century Christianity, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their significance while adapting to this paradigm shift. The current denominational diversity will likely converge toward a more unified expression of faith. Historical precedents for such dramatic transformations exist: consider Rome's evolution from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or America's journey from slavery to racial inclusion in leadership.\n\nThis anticipated religious reformation will necessitate a sophisticated hermeneutical approach, particularly in interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To comprehend this evolution, we must examine Christianity's origins in Judaism. Prior to Rome's occupation of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority. The Jewish community, however, was not monolithic, encompassing diverse groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through a critical analysis of The Jungle, one can observe a profound commentary on humanity's inherent disposition toward avarice and self-preservation. The narrative expertly illustrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of authority, consistently prioritize personal advancement while disregarding the welfare of their subordinates. This phenomenon manifests most prominently in the conduct of industrial magnates and their administrative personnel.\n\nThese powerful figures demonstrate an unwavering commitment to corporate expansion and profit maximization, exhibiting complete indifference to the collateral damage inflicted upon both society and the environment. As Sinclair vividly depicts, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery serves as a metaphor for the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization, highlighting the manufacturers' blatant disregard for ecological consequences, including atmospheric pollution and unsanitary conditions stemming from livestock facilities.\n\nThe exploitation extends beyond environmental concerns to encompass labor relations. As the text states, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The absence of worker protection legislation during this historical period enabled management to subject employees to hazardous conditions and arbitrary termination without recourse. The laborers, predominantly immigrants living in perpetual economic uncertainty, found themselves trapped in a system reminiscent of institutionalized servitude. As Sinclair observes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Literary scholars have long debated the influences behind Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land.\" The recurring mention of \"Thulé\" within the poem presents an intriguing connection to classical literature. While some academics point to Virgil's use of the term - describing a mysterious northern isle beyond Britain's shores - a more compelling source emerges from German literature.\n\nThe connection between Poe's work and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust\" (published in two segments: 1808 and 1832) deserves particular attention. Within \"Faust Part Two,\" Goethe crafts \"The King of Thulé,\" a haunting narrative about a bereaved monarch. This ruler, having received a goblet from his dying queen, descends into grief-stricken drinking before ultimately choosing death, keeping only the meaningful chalice while distributing his other possessions to his heirs. His final act - casting the goblet into the ocean before his own death - resonates deeply with themes found in Poe's writings.\n\nThe thematic parallels between these works are striking. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" explore realms of profound loss, isolation, and darkness. Poe's narrator traverses a colorless landscape populated by ghostly remembrances, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's monarch. Notably, Poe employs \"Thule\" in both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" suggesting a deliberate literary connection.\n\nGoethe's influence on nineteenth-century literature was considerable, and Poe's appreciation for contemporary European writers, particularly Tennyson (himself an admirer of Goethe), suggests he would have been well-versed in the German master's works. The proliferation of Goethe translations and adaptations during this period, including H.P. Grattan's 1842 dramatic interpretation of \"Faust,\" would have made these works readily accessible to American literary circles.",
            "I'm analyzing whether punitive damages could be awarded in a California slip-and-fall case where store management displayed potential negligence regarding a hazardous situation.\n\nThe incident occurred at D&D Markets when customer Jennifer Palmer suffered a severe back injury after slipping on spilled applesauce. The critical element here is that two separate employees had notified Manager Paul Martin about the hazard, yet he chose to continue his dinner break rather than address the situation. The spill remained unattended for approximately 30 minutes before the accident occurred.\n\nThe legal framework in California permits punitive damages when defendants exhibit \"oppression, fraud or malice\" (California Civil Code 3294(a)). In this context, malice encompasses both intentional harm and \"despicable conduct\" showing conscious disregard for safety. Precedent indicates that awareness of probable dangers combined with deliberate inaction can constitute malicious conduct (reference: Taylor v. Superior Court).\n\nSeveral factors strengthen the case for punitive damages. First, D&D Markets had experienced five previous slip-and-fall incidents that same year, establishing a pattern of safety concerns. Second, Martin's repeated dismissal of employee warnings demonstrates conscious disregard for customer safety. While proving \"despicable conduct\" presents challenges, Martin's prioritization of his dinner break over addressing a known safety hazard, especially given the store's history of similar incidents, provides reasonable grounds for pursuing punitive damages.\n\nBased on these considerations, a court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed past summary judgment, though success at trial would depend on effectively demonstrating Martin's conscious disregard for customer safety.",
            "The emptiness gnawed at her consciousness since puberty struck. From the tender age of fourteen through her current seventeen years, an inexplicable void persisted within her soul. Eventually, she recognized that this yearning wasn't for an object but for companionship. Curiously though, despite numerous advances from potential suitors, no male ever sparked her interest. This peculiarity prompted countless hours of introspection, yet no satisfactory explanation emerged to illuminate this romantic anomaly.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere in which she dwelled typically exuded tranquility. Her parents, paragons of serenity, rarely engaged in confrontations, either with each other or their offspring. The sole source of friction arose from her assertions of autonomy - a natural byproduct of her vibrant personality, which stood in stark contrast to her parents' placid demeanor. Her effervescent nature, coupled with genuine kindness, endeared her to many.\n\nThe day's peaceful facade shattered with an unexpected shriek emanating from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice, now distorted by pain, pierced the air. Rushing to investigate, she discovered her maternal figure sprawled across the floor, each breath punctuated by agonized gasps. \"Hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths. Drawing upon strength cultivated through dedicated training, she carefully transported her injured mother to their vehicle, positioning her gently across the back seat before embarking on an urgent journey.\n\nThe clinical environment of the emergency room, with its characteristic antiseptic atmosphere and underlying current of anxiety, barely registered in her consciousness. Her singular focus remained on securing immediate medical attention for her mother. After facilitating a swift transfer onto a gurney, she watched helplessly as medical personnel whisked her mother away for evaluation.\n\nThe catalyst for this crisis? A simple domestic accident - her mother's unfortunate tumble from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a decorative vessel from an elevated storage space.",
            "Recent research explores the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns resembling traditional Mediterranean cuisine. Investigators aimed to evaluate whether individuals following Mediterranean-inspired eating habits, quantified through an adapted scoring system (aMed), experienced reduced instances of heart disease, stroke occurrences, and related fatalities.\n\nThe aMed framework emphasizes abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and proteins derived from plants and fish, while limiting animal-based products. It promotes the use of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats over saturated alternatives and permits reasonable alcohol consumption.\n\nEarlier investigations revealed promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating patterns and decreased mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes. One notable experiment demonstrated superior outcomes in obese participants following Mediterranean guidelines compared to low-fat dietary restrictions, specifically regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles. However, these previous analyses hadn't specifically targeted stroke-related outcomes.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals, aged 38-63, participating in a broader health assessment initiative across 11 American states. Researchers collected dietary information through detailed questionnaires at six intervals between 1984 and 2004, maintaining an impressive 95% participant retention rate. The team verified reported cardiovascular events through medical documentation, with approximately one-fifth classified as probable cases when complete records weren't available.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of dietary adherence scores and accounted for various lifestyle factors, including exercise habits, smoking status, and hormone therapy use. Statistical analysis employed Cox proportional-hazard models to evaluate relationships between dietary patterns and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective benefits among participants demonstrating stronger Mediterranean diet adherence. Throughout the two-decade observation period, researchers documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths. Statistical analysis indicated that participants with the highest dietary compliance experienced 29% lower risk compared to those with minimal adherence.",
            "A solitary figure emerges from the urban landscape - actress Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, displaying a peculiar message board overhead. The text, drafted in permanent marker, makes an outlandish claim about Hitler's whereabouts in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has endured decades of military control since a 1962 military takeover. The nation witnessed unprecedented civil unrest in 2007, marked by what became known as the \"Saffron Revolution\" - named for the distinctive garments worn by Buddhist monks who initiated the demonstrations. As public participation swelled, the initially tolerant military regime's response grew increasingly hostile, culminating in widespread monastery raids and violent confrontations.\n\nInternational media faced severe restrictions, with journalists facing immediate detention. The situation turned deadly when Kenji Nagai, a photojournalist from Japan, lost his life while documenting a demonstration on September 27th, 2007. Although official records indicate only 13 casualties, a military defector, Colonel Hla Win, suggested the actual death count reached thousands.\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese imperial tradition ascribed godlike status to their rulers. Even modern governance shows traces of authoritarian tendencies, as exemplified by certain political-religious alliances in contemporary America.\n\nHistorical precedents include China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, where peaceful demonstrators faced military intervention. Casualty estimates vary dramatically - Chinese authorities claim 200-300 deaths, while Red Cross data suggests 2,000-3,000 perished. The 1990s Rwandan crisis saw systematic elimination of Tutsis and moderate politicians by Hutu militias with government support. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany represents another devastating example of state-sponsored persecution.",
            "The remarkable impact of Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his enduring career and extraordinary talent for orchestral innovation. While his piano work often maintains a delicate presence in many compositions, his true genius manifested in creating intricate musical pieces that brilliantly showcased his musicians' individual talents. The maestro developed sophisticated frameworks allowing for both spontaneous improvisation and meticulously arranged segments, carefully tailored to highlight each performer's unique stylistic approach. This methodology resulted in distinctive orchestral signatures that perfectly complemented each composition's character. His profound understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to produce some of jazz's most groundbreaking compositions.\n\nAccording to Grove Music's scholarly analysis, compositions like \"Creole Love Call\" exemplify Ellington's pioneering approach to incorporating vocals as instrumental elements throughout his musical journey. This piece demonstrates his exceptional ability to enhance soloists' performances, a skill that remained constant throughout his career. The composition, structured as a measured twelve-bar blues, unfolds through six distinct choruses:\n\nInitial Chorus: Interplay between vocals and woodwinds, transitioning from fluid melody to textured timbre\nSecond Chorus: Dampened trumpet elaborating the core melody with extended blue notes\nThird Chorus: High-register clarinet solo floating above subtle syncopated piano\nFourth Chorus: Full orchestral interpretation featuring brass and reed section dialogue\nFifth Chorus: Climactic movement with high-register reed initiation backed by brass and rhythm\nFinal Chorus: Return to vocal-reed dialogue with instrumental-style vocal growls\nConclusion: Short vocal passage ending with dissonant trombone flourish\n\nThis innovative vocal incorporation represents just one facet of Ellington's distinctive musical vocabulary. Later works like \"Hot and Bothered\" showcase his masterful orchestration combined with tonal exploration, featuring remarkable interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scatting. Similarly, \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" demonstrates his brilliant utilization of Nanton's trombone prowess in establishing the melodic foundation.",
            "What mechanisms drive evolutionary patterns in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the boundaries that shape evolutionary trajectories. Nearly a century after D'Arcy Thompson lamented the lack of mathematical frameworks in biological form studies, this challenge persists. Contemporary research has made strides in applying quantitative approaches to understand mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution.\n\nOur research investigates Prunum specimens using mathematical frameworks combined with empirical observations. By analyzing X-ray images of various Prunum species, we extracted numerical parameters to construct both theoretical and actual shell configurations using CerioShell software. This approach enables us to explore the theoretical limits of morphological variation within this genus, complementing our laboratory studies to illuminate major evolutionary transitions.\n\nUnderstanding shell architecture requires recognizing it as a helical structure rotating through space. The spiral components, known as whorls, encircle a central columella. Shell growth patterns exhibit varying expansion rates, with distinct suture lines marking whorl boundaries. The final whorl, termed the body whorl, typically achieves the greatest diameter. Above it lies the spire, comprising earlier whorls, terminating in the apex. The base occupies the opposite end, featuring the aperture through which the organism extends.\n\nShell examination typically involves four perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard presentation shows the apertural view, displaying the opening while positioning the apex upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a systematic protocol. Beginning with an apical perspective, observers locate the initial suture point. A reference line bisects the shell, allowing whorl counts in quarter-turn increments from this starting point.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a sequence of apertures progressing through three-dimensional space during calcium carbonate deposition. This growth pattern can be mapped using aperture center coordinates and dimensional measurements.\n\nSuch spatial progressions yield both visual and mathematical representations. These models facilitate parameter manipulation, allowing exploration of alternative developmental pathways in mollusk shell formation.",
            "During the past decade, Indonesia's infant and newborn death rates have shown minimal fluctuation. Despite making progress on various Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation initiatives, the nation struggles significantly with improving maternal and child health metrics. These challenges, which will be examined in detail, suggest that strengthening the broader healthcare infrastructure might prove more beneficial than implementing targeted programs.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has achieved a 72% rate of professionally attended births, this statistic warrants closer scrutiny. Many of these attendants are traditional practitioners, including local midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications like severe bleeding during childbirth. Furthermore, recent data shows declining professional medical intervention rates for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions. The limited available information regarding post-birth care also indicates substantial inadequacies nationwide.\n\nSurgical birth procedures remain unexpectedly low at approximately 4% overall, with notable disparities between regions. Urban areas maintain a 7% cesarean delivery rate, while rural regions report only 2%, highlighting significant geographical healthcare inequities. Socioeconomic factors also play a crucial role, with a substantial 27% difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant healthcare metrics, policymakers face a fundamental choice between targeted interventions and comprehensive healthcare system reform. While specialized programs offer appealing advantages, including clearer objectives and quicker results, they present notable challenges. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health sectors, as evidenced by how international HIV/AIDS funding has impacted family planning initiatives. Moreover, multiple parallel programs frequently create redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, resulting in excessive bureaucratic procedures for resource allocation and management.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing an ever-growing array of musical styles and categories. Within this vast landscape, numerous primary genres - including hip-hop, rock, country, jazz, and folk music - have evolved into intricate networks of specialized subgenres. Perhaps most notably, Heavy Metal has emerged as an exceptionally rich and nuanced form of musical expression since its inception four decades ago. While often associated with darker emotional themes, Metal's versatility has allowed it to branch into countless distinctive variations, with new subgenres continuously emerging as artists explore its creative boundaries.\n\nContemporary Heavy Metal presents such a complex tapestry of musical styles that defining its essential characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has assimilated elements from various musical traditions, understanding its current form requires examining its origins. The genre represents more than just a musical category - it constitutes a genuine cultural movement.\n\nThe essence of Metal lies in its embrace of extremes. It pushes boundaries across multiple dimensions: amplification, instrumental virtuosity, theatrical presentation, and emotional intensity. Musicians within this genre typically demonstrate exceptional technical proficiency, setting it apart from more primitive musical forms. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic culture of the 1970s, when artists, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal introduced a raw, visceral quality previously absent from mainstream music, and later iterations drew inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic-era compositions. Consider the dark themes evident in \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of Heavy Metal's precursors. This Beatles track, created as a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier sound, demonstrated the band's ability to embrace darker, more intense musical elements, earning its place on their White Album.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, exemplifies both the literal representation of a woman experiencing a mystical dreamscape and the metaphorical manifestation of Rousseau's professional aspirations. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau grappled with the fundamental tension between conforming to established artistic conventions to gain acceptance and following his unique creative instincts.\n\nUnderstanding the context of Rousseau's life illuminates the significance of The Dream. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau emerged from a middle-class background, his father being a moderately successful hardware merchant. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau never received formal artistic training. Instead, he spent four decades working as a municipal toll collector, often mistakenly referred to as a customs officer. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - his first marriage to Clémence ended in profound sorrow, with the loss of eight children in infancy, leaving only his daughter Julia. Art became his sanctuary, a means of processing grief and seeking new purpose. His artistic perspective reflected his working-class origins, offering an authentic rather than romanticized view of ordinary life.\n\nThe timing of Rousseau's artistic career posed unique challenges. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of numerous accomplished modernist painters. Despite years of dedication, recognition eluded him until approximately the same period when Henri Matisse was establishing his reputation. The contrast between these contemporary artists was striking: while Matisse actively sought to revolutionize artistic expression, Rousseau paradoxically strived for conventional acceptance within the established art community, as noted by art critic Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters.",
            "The relationship between moral principles and artistic expression has long fascinated scholars and philosophers. This connection runs deeper than mere coincidence. While conventional wisdom suggests that learning primarily occurs through formal education or direct experience, our understanding of ethics and artistic beauty seems to develop through different channels. Instead of following prescribed rules, both fields focus on explaining why certain actions are considered moral or why particular works resonate as beautiful.\n\nWhen analyzing artistic or moral merit, we often encounter limitations in fully articulating their essence. Consider how art critics discuss masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - they might reference technical elements such as composition or historical significance, yet these explanations rarely capture the artwork's true impact. Similarly, when people describe their favorite artistic works, they frequently preface their analysis with phrases acknowledging an ineffable quality that defies complete explanation.\n\nThis parallel between artistic appreciation and moral understanding extends beyond surface-level similarities. Both domains possess an element that transcends conventional description or analysis. Literary works, in particular, demonstrate this phenomenon clearly - no matter how thoroughly we analyze their components, something intangible remains beyond our grasp. This elusive quality appears in both artistic expression and ethical understanding, suggesting a fundamental connection between these two spheres of human experience.\n\nThe intersection of morality and artistic expression becomes particularly evident in literature. Unlike other art forms, literature inherently incorporates moral dimensions that mirror life itself. Our engagement with literary works often centers on their value systems and ethical implications, making them uniquely positioned to explore and illuminate moral questions. This special characteristic of literature - its ability to engage with moral considerations while maintaining artistic merit - highlights the intrinsic connection between aesthetic and ethical understanding.",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a powerhouse nation, weaving together diverse regional identities from Munich's alpine surroundings to the northern maritime culture of Kiel. This cultural tapestry stretches across the nation, connecting cities like Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden's historic streets by the Elbe. The rich mosaic of contemporary German society reflects its complex origins, rooted in various ancient peoples and tribal confederations.\n\nThe ancestral homeland known as Germania has sparked considerable academic debate regarding its nomenclature. Historical records indicate multiple potential origins: the Tungri tribe theory proposed by Tacitus, Caesar's adoption of Gallic terminology during his campaigns, and linguistic connections to ancient weapons or behavioral characteristics. The term \"Germanus\" emerged prominently in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he documented frequent conflicts between Gallic peoples and tribes beyond the Rhine frontier.\n\nAncient documentation provides fascinating insights into Germania's early inhabitants. Tacitus's seminal work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (98 CE) presents a compelling argument for the indigenous nature of Germanic peoples, suggesting their isolation and distinctive character. He emphasized the region's challenging environment and questioned why anyone would willingly migrate to such harsh territory unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania remained primarily transactional. While Roman expeditions ventured into Germanic territories for resources and military campaigns, permanent Roman settlement proved limited. Germanic tribes established themselves as significant players along the empire's frontiers during the first century CE, engaging in trade and military service with Rome while maintaining their independence (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The resolution of such pretense often forces an uncomfortable choice between maintaining relationships and reclaiming one's true identity, as those deceived may react with varying degrees of acceptance or hostility.\n\nThe narrative particularly scrutinizes gender-based deception, raising fundamental questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine dress emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy inadvertently severs potential feminine alliances.\n\nThis masquerade generates unforeseen complications, notably Olivia's misplaced affections: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Furthermore, it creates an intricate emotional entanglement with Orsino, evidenced in his words: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nContemporary interpretations might view the play as an examination of how artifice can catalyze the emergence of latent desires, particularly regarding Olivia and Orsino's reactions to Viola's disguise. Their responses potentially suggest unexplored aspects of their own identities. However, Olivia's character appears more likely constructed as Shakespeare's commentary on superficial attraction rather than deeper identity questions. This interpretation gains credence through her swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her ultimate familial acceptance of Viola: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "Scholars have frequently highlighted the extreme measures employed in Germany's colonial territories, particularly regarding the systematic elimination of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, it would be an oversimplification to characterize the entire German colonial experience through this single lens. The empire's administrative approaches and educational initiatives varied substantially across its diverse territories.\n\nWhen British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) following World War I, they encountered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other territories by writers of the era. However, the educational landscape in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) told a markedly different story.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational framework established in East Africa, South West African authorities delegated native education almost exclusively to religious organizations, offering minimal governmental assistance. Conversely, substantial resources were allocated to European education in the territory, including state-run schools and enhanced support for missionary institutions serving white settlers. This educational disparity created lasting implications, with South West Africa's indigenous population remaining largely unschooled while other former German colonies produced numerous educated individuals.\n\nThe academic literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, though predominantly written in German during or shortly after colonial rule. Initial studies focused primarily on describing educational structures, while subsequent English-language research has offered comparative analyses and deeper exploration of specific educational aspects. Notable among these is Cohen's comparative study of South West and East African educational systems, which attributes many of South West Africa's distinctive educational characteristics to its substantial settler population.\n\nThe territory's relatively moderate climate, despite its predominantly desert landscape, attracted significant European settlement. By 1913, South West Africa hosted nearly 15,000 European residents, almost triple the white population of East Africa, the next most heavily settled German colony.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that characterized their relationship for nearly six decades (Diehl and Goerts 2000, 145). The relationship reached its most contentious point during the 1846-1848 conflict, when American forces conquered Mexican territories, including Texas and what would become the Southwest. Prior to World War I, numerous confrontations occurred between these neighboring nations, sparked by fundamental differences in faith, societal values, and competing national interests (Schmitt 1974, 30-31).\n\nSuch patterns of conflict often emerge between adjacent nations. Geographic proximity frequently breeds competition over resources and influence, as demonstrated by countless historical examples. Mexico and Cuba stand out as particularly noteworthy cases of sustained diplomatic tension with the United States, as noted by Pletcher (1977, 41). Their proximity to American shores has contributed to these strained relationships, contrasting sharply with the generally positive connections maintained with other Latin American nations.\n\nFaith-based divisions played a crucial role in the discord. Frahm (2001, 86) notes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchical rule in earlier centuries paralleled its later resistance to fascism and communism. Similar to how Cold War tensions combined ideological differences with practical concerns, religious disparities between Protestant America and Catholic Mexico intensified their rivalry. These religious tensions stemmed from historical Anglo-Spanish antagonisms, which the former colonies inherited and perpetuated.\n\nThroughout the 57-year period of rivalry, Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct conflicts. Border security dominated these disputes, with cross-border criminal activity causing significant diplomatic strain. Both nations eventually deployed military forces to address these frontier challenges (Schmitt 1974, 97).\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico's economic dependence on the United States grew. According to Schmitt (1974, 109-110), American priorities shifted from territorial acquisition to economic influence in Mexico during the late 1800s, fundamentally altering the relationship's dynamic.",
            "In 2008, a rare medical condition struck without warning, transforming my life overnight. At that juncture, I was employed in healthcare, a career path I had selected primarily for its perceived stability. Growing up, I frequently heard people say, \"Healthcare jobs will never disappear - illness is a constant.\" Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I opted for the practical route into nursing.\n\nThe reality hit hard at age 46: unmarried, minimal savings, and suddenly incapacitated. Currently, after a decade and a half of relying on disability benefits, my personal possessions have dwindled to almost nothing. Daily survival requires constant effort, challenging both my sense of security and dignity. While uncertainty permeates every aspect of my existence, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. When facing genuine hardship, even the strongest individuals feel vulnerable.\n\nLife's challenges, whether minor or major, are inevitable. Despite careful planning, certain obstacles prove insurmountable without assistance. While I acknowledge the need to reduce dependence on federal programs in America - given their obvious deterioration - I advocate for strengthening community bonds rather than promoting isolation.\n\nSome political figures glorify self-reliance as America's founding principle. However, historical evidence suggests that mutual aid, respect, and resource-sharing were the true cornerstones of early American survival. Consider the westward expansion - success depended on collective effort, not individual prowess.\n\nPreparation remains crucial. My emergency supplies include medical equipment, water treatment solutions, protective materials, illumination devices, and non-perishable food items. Those with available land should consider small-scale agriculture and food preservation. Alternative heating methods, where feasible, provide additional security.\n\nHowever, the most valuable preparation may be cultivating relationships within your community.",
            "Buddhism emerged when a noble heir, later recognized as the Buddha, experienced spiritual awakening during the 5th or 6th century BCE. His enlightenment and subsequent teachings gave rise to various Buddhist traditions, with Theravada emerging as the most traditional branch. As this spiritual movement approaches its 2500th anniversary, modern practitioners would hardly recognize its original form. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual observed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony embraced by both religious officials and everyday followers, despite having no direct connection to the Buddha's original teachings. Such evolution extends beyond mere customs, reaching into the fundamental principles of salvation and spiritual liberation.\n\nThe Buddhist framework has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, with both clergy and lay followers modifying their interpretations of core principles in response to various pressures. These catalysts for change can be categorized in several ways: those originating within versus outside the Buddhist community, and those intended to harm versus those that influence unintentionally.\n\nTo properly analyze these transformations, we must establish clear definitions. Changes originating from Buddhist practitioners, regardless of their status, represent internal influences. Conversely, modifications stemming from non-Buddhist sources constitute external influences. Harmful pressures actively seek to undermine Buddhist practices, while neutral influences may affect the tradition without specific intent to help or harm.\n\nTo understand these evolutionary forces, one must first grasp Buddhism's foundational principles. Adherents seek guidance through three sacred elements: the Buddha himself, his teachings (Dhamma), and the monastic community (Sangha). The Dhamma encompasses three collections of sacred texts: the Suttas (discourses), Vinaya (monastic regulations), and Abhidhamma (philosophical analyses). Key concepts include the absence of an eternal self (Anatta), life's inherent challenges (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Understanding these principles enables escape from the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and freedom from desire (lobha), aversion (dosa), and ignorance (moha). While monastics follow numerous regulations, lay practitioners observe five basic ethical guidelines regarding harmful actions, dishonesty, theft, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Central to all practice are the four noble truths, beginning with life's fundamental challenges, their origin in attachment, and the possibility of transcendence."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",

A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "When engaging in negotiations, cultural awareness emerges as a critical factor. The concept of culture resists simple categorization; it manifests as a complex tapestry of behaviors, beliefs, and practices. Sweeping generalizations about national characteristics—for instance, attributing specific traits to entire populations—often miss the nuanced reality of human interaction. Instead, successful negotiators focus on understanding how cultural elements specifically influence the dynamics at the bargaining table.\n\nIndividuals naturally view unfamiliar cultures through the lens of their own experiences. To bridge cultural gaps effectively, one must invest time in understanding the target culture's historical context and inherent biases. Success in cross-cultural negotiations demands acceptance rather than criticism, particularly when operating from a position of limited leverage. This principle becomes especially relevant when conducting business in unfamiliar territories, where respecting local customs can facilitate breakthrough moments.\n\nCultural considerations extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its distinctive environment, manifesting in various ways—from workplace timing expectations to dress requirements. These differences appear in multiple aspects: communication preferences, organizational hierarchies, and recruitment strategies. Even within single organizations, notable variations exist across different locations and settings. While some societies might present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals underlying complexities.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides crucial insight into cultural motivations. In environments prioritizing group harmony and reputation preservation, negotiators typically avoid actions that might compromise organizational or leadership standing. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may pursue aggressive bargaining strategies. While these broad cultural patterns merit consideration, developing personal connections with negotiating counterparts often proves equally valuable for achieving optimal outcomes.",
            "When examining theological discourse, we encounter a fascinating quote from Psalms that declares \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This declaration appears prominently in both biblical text and philosophical arguments, particularly those of Anselm and Aquinas. In analyzing their respective positions on divine existence, we must establish parameters. Given that both philosophers advocate for the Christian deity specifically, our comparative analysis should focus on their methodologies rather than debating which conception of divinity they defend. However, despite their earnest attempts, neither thinker provides an entirely satisfactory framework for establishing God's existence.\n\nAnselm's methodology centers on internal contemplation and rational deduction. His argument posits that divine existence can be demonstrated through pure reason and self-reflection. The core of his thesis suggests that because we can conceptualize a perfect being, such a being must necessarily exist, as existence itself is a form of perfection. This introspective approach relies heavily on mental exercises and logical constructs, eschewing external validation in favor of intellectual meditation.\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions an empirical approach, developing five distinct pathways to prove God's existence through observable phenomena. His methodology would particularly appeal to skeptics and those requiring tangible evidence, as it builds upon natural observation rather than abstract reasoning. Aquinas presents arguments based on motion, causation, necessity, gradation, and design. His framework resembles solving a jigsaw puzzle - by understanding the shape of what's missing, one can deduce the nature of the absent piece without direct observation. This empirically-grounded approach stands in marked contrast to Anselm's contemplative methodology.",
            "Literary authors employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. In examining \"The Great Gatsby,\" we observe how effectively its creator manipulates language and symbolism to achieve desired effects. One notable approach involves unconventional pairing of descriptive words with objects, creating unexpected associations. However, perhaps more intriguing is the deliberate use of color symbolism throughout the narrative.\n\nThe novel demonstrates particular mastery in its deployment of chromatic imagery, especially through shades like amber, emerald, ivory/slate, and crimson/rose. These carefully chosen hues serve as recurring motifs, carrying deeper significance beyond mere visual description. Of particular interest is the author's handling of ivory/slate and crimson/rose tones, which develop distinct connotations as the story progresses.\n\nThe ivory/slate spectrum emerges as a powerful metaphor for conformity and social stratification. Ivory suggests refinement and privilege, while slate conveys aging and diminished glory. This dichotomy manifests throughout the narrative: socialites routinely appear in ivory attire, from the protagonist's casual wear at gatherings to secondary characters' everyday dress. The sole deviation occurs during the notorious party scene, where vivid primary colors dominate instead.\n\nThese neutral tones extend beyond fashion to characterize environments and individuals alike. Urban landscapes feature ivory canyons of architecture, while social registers contain slate-colored names of party attendees. Even residential descriptions emphasize this palette, with apartments described as segments of a massive ivory structure. Common folk and ordinary settings consistently receive these neutral descriptors: childhood memories, vehicles, landscapes, and various background characters all bear these understated hues.\n\nOnce established, this color symbolism becomes instrumental in character development, particularly regarding the female love interest. Her consistent association with ivory tones gradually transforms her from a dynamic character into a symbol of societal conformity, representing an idealized yet ultimately uniform object of desire.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local producers cultivate an impressive array of crops, ranging from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh herbs and seasonal berries. The region's thriving organic agriculture sector experiences unprecedented demand, evidenced by extensive waitlists for community-supported farming initiatives. Beyond traditional farming, these establishments frequently serve as educational venues, offering guided tours and recreational opportunities like nature walks and wildlife observation.\n\nThe transition to organic farming methods presents both opportunities and challenges for agricultural entrepreneurs. While organic practices foster enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem health through chemical-free cultivation, they demand significant investment in manual labor and innovative pest management strategies. Smaller organic operations often struggle to achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by conventional farms, necessitating creative approaches to revenue generation.\n\nThis case study examines a 160-acre property situated near Potrero, California, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The land encompasses diverse ecosystems, including chaparral, Mediterranean grassland (non-indigenous), and oak woodland habitats. This location falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone, as defined by San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The area serves as habitat for numerous protected species, including the imperiled Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher, among others facing population decline.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples inhabited this region for generations before ranchers and wood merchants established themselves in the nineteenth century. The property's origins as a homestead suggest its historical use for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis explores potential governmental support programs available to small-scale farmers interested in balancing agricultural productivity with wildlife conservation, using an existing organic operation in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection, particularly between brothers - a connection that transcends ordinary relationships and encompasses a spectrum of powerful emotions. From affection to rivalry, from admiration to resentment, these feelings intertwine in complex patterns. When brothers look at each other, they often glimpse reflections of themselves, and this mirror effect becomes most pronounced during times of crisis. The true test of brotherly bonds emerges in moments of extreme pressure, revealing either nobility or darkness within their relationship. These revelations often come at significant personal cost, as the consequences of brotherhood-driven actions ripple through their lives.\n\nThis intricate dynamic is masterfully portrayed in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where readers witness the relationship between two siblings unfold against a richly detailed Southern backdrop. The story traces their journey - both literal and metaphorical - through a landscape as complex as their relationship. The narrative reaches its peak in a dramatic confrontation where fraternal pride collides with devastating reality, ultimately claiming one brother's life. Through careful character development and first-person narration, the author reveals the elder brother's complicated emotional landscape and his perception of the world around him.\n\nThe older brother's character arc revolves primarily around his overwhelming sense of pride. His relationship with Doodle, his younger sibling, is colored by persistent disappointment from their earliest interactions. He had envisioned teaching a brother the quintessential childhood activities - breath-holding contests, sprinting across fields, scaling vines in Old Woman Swamp, and racing to Horsehead Landing. He longed for a companion to share adventures with, particularly someone to join him in his favorite perch atop the towering pine behind their barn. These aspirations proved impossible due to Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival and permanently limited his physical capabilities. This harsh reality so devastated the protagonist that he briefly contemplated a horrifying solution - suffocation with a pillow. Yet, this dark impulse dissolved instantly when confronted with Doodle's innocent smile, revealing that beneath his disappointment lay an innate, unshakeable brotherly love.",
            "Our neural architecture represents an intricate system capable of processing vast amounts of data while exhibiting remarkable creativity. Throughout history, scholars have drawn parallels between the mind and contemporary innovations of their time - from ancient writing surfaces to modern computational devices. However, one must exercise caution when employing such analogies, as they often fall short of capturing the brain's true complexity.\n\nNeural processing initiates when our sensory receptors convert environmental stimuli into neural signals. These signals undergo dual processing mechanisms: ascending pathways compile basic sensory data, while descending pathways facilitate rapid interpretation based on existing knowledge. Consider observing a dark square against a light field - ascending processes identify elementary features like edges and contrast, while descending processes aid in determining whether we're viewing a solid object or a void.\n\nThe neural gateway of attention determines which signals merit deeper cognitive engagement. This filtering mechanism explains why we might overlook countless environmental details - such as individual grass blades beneath our feet - yet instantly recognize our name in crowded environments. This selective process occurs continuously throughout various stages of cognitive processing.\n\nData storage within neural networks occurs through multiple memory systems. These include immediate sensory registers, temporary working storage, and permanent neural archives. The encoding process varies by input type - linguistic information, for instance, may be stored based on visual appearance, acoustic properties, or meaning. Research suggests temporary memory maintenance involves neural circuits sustaining electrical activity for approximately twenty seconds, while long-term storage likely depends on protein structural modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks explaining neural knowledge organization. These theories draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent model suggests information exists as interconnected conceptual nodes - similar to a web where related concepts (like \"furniture,\" \"wood,\" and \"dining\") form natural associations.",
            "The devastating economic collapse of 2007 marked a turning point in American financial history. As millions lost their jobs, homeowners faced foreclosure, and major financial institutions crumbled, the nation grappled with an unprecedented crisis that continues to influence policy decisions today. The root causes trace back to a complex web of misguided financial practices, particularly the widespread distribution of high-risk mortgages within an inadequately regulated system. Financial giants, including government-sponsored enterprises, engaged in questionable practices involving mortgage derivatives, ultimately triggering a domino effect when borrowers began defaulting en masse.\n\nThe seeds of destruction were planted during the late 1990s, when political motivations led to significant changes in lending policies. Contemporary journalism captured this shift, with notable coverage from The New York Times highlighting how Fannie Mae faced mounting pressure to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. These prescient reports warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to previous financial sector bailouts.\n\nThe crisis's complexity deepened through innovative but risky financial instruments. Financial markets embraced sophisticated mortgage products and derivatives, creating an intricate web of dependencies throughout the economy. This interconnectedness left the entire system vulnerable to fluctuations in housing prices, as households and institutions accumulated unprecedented levels of debt exposure to real estate.\n\nThe eventual market correction proved catastrophic. Major investment banks, collectively holding mortgage-related obligations worth nearly one-third of America's GDP, faced existential threats. The landscape of American finance transformed dramatically: prestigious institutions either collapsed or underwent forced acquisitions, while others abandoned their investment banking status to survive under stricter regulatory frameworks. Government-sponsored enterprises, bearing the weight of trillions in mortgage obligations, ultimately required federal intervention to prevent complete collapse.",
            "Let's discuss the perils of information dumps in storytelling. Writers often face a temptation to unleash torrents of background details, believing they're crafting intricate narrative tapestries. However, this approach frequently backfires, leading readers to disengage or abandon the story entirely. Even experienced authors sometimes catch themselves drowning their narratives in excessive detail.\n\nInformation dumping is a narrative pitfall.\n\nWhile most writers understand the fundamental principle of demonstrating rather than explaining, it's remarkably easy to slip into lengthy descriptive passages where action stagnates or becomes overwhelming. This tendency often manifests as an internal struggle between two competing urges: the desire to establish context quickly versus the impulse to elaborate on every minute detail of character backgrounds.\n\nInformation dumping occurs when writers explicitly state background information instead of weaving it naturally into the narrative. In cinema, this manifests as dialogue-heavy scenes where characters unnaturally explain situations to each other. Literary works face similar challenges when authors resort to direct exposition.\n\nConsider this scenario: A narrative briefly summarizes a couple's entire relationship - their meeting, wedding, and the tragic murder of the spouse - in just two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach deprives readers of crucial emotional connections. Instead, the story should illustrate the husband's devotion through his actions and words, demonstrate how the relationship transformed both characters, and allow readers to form genuine attachments to these individuals. This investment makes the tragedy more impactful and reveals deeper insights into the surviving character's personality.\n\nEssentially, narratives require substance beyond basic plot points.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly catalogue character details. For instance, when introducing a former Air Force servicemember who now manages a gas station at night, has two failed marriages, enjoys fishing, harbors entrepreneurial ambitions, and maintains specific breakfast preferences, these details deserve thoughtful integration rather than immediate disclosure.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable broadcasts on NBC 4. The morning programming began with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended an individual following an assault on his spouse involving multiple stab wounds. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the situation.\n\nSubsequently, the broadcast covered an incident involving an 18-year-old victim of gun violence in the Sharon Woods district. The coverage appeared notably brief despite the severity of the incident and ongoing SWAT involvement. This observation raises questions about potential disparities in media coverage based on demographic factors, as I've noted a pattern of abbreviated reporting when victims belong to minority communities.\n\nThe broadcast continued with details regarding an aviation incident involving a medical transport helicopter that sustained damage from what investigators determined to be a .22 caliber projectile. Authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to the perpetrator's identification.\n\nWeather coverage followed, albeit briefly, highlighting anticipated precipitation and moderate temperatures for the weekend period. The concise nature of this segment appeared strategically designed to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe program also reported on a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, with what seemed to be disproportionate emphasis on the suspect's physical characteristics and racial identity. The final segment detailed the conviction of a narcotics distributor responsible for interstate trafficking operations, with an unusual presentation of the sentence duration in months rather than years, and arguably unnecessary emphasis on the individual's ethnic background.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. These investment vehicles mirror various market segments while offering advantages typically associated with individual stocks, including short-selling opportunities, margin trading, and single-share purchasing options. Despite providing these sophisticated features, ETFs maintain surprisingly competitive cost structures, with management fees significantly below typical mutual fund rates.\n\nInvestors should note certain trade-offs, particularly the requirement to pay brokerage commissions on transactions, similar to stock trades. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across numerous sectors and asset classes. However, prudent investors must conduct thorough due diligence regarding marketed advantages such as portfolio diversification, carefully assessing both their presence and magnitude.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the healthcare ETF designated as IHF, comparing its characteristics against its primary constituent stocks. Our investigation aims to determine whether holding the ETF provides comparable benefits to maintaining positions in its major components, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns or absolute performance.\n\nGiven practical constraints, our examination concentrates on the fund's top ten holdings, which constitute approximately 63.58% of total assets. These positions serve as our analytical foundation.\n\nTo assess how effectively these major components reflect the complete IHF portfolio, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the resulting portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns. Our computational framework is detailed in the accompanying data.\n\nInitial findings reveal intriguing disparities: a hypothetical portfolio comprising solely these primary holdings generates returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points, representing a 16% performance differential. Additionally, this concentrated portfolio exhibits reduced market sensitivity, with a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. While these preliminary results suggest potential advantages in holding the individual components, we must consider whether these differences achieve statistical significance.\n\nTo address this question, we analyzed the standard deviations of the constituent stocks, normalizing these values for direct comparison with the ETF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter participation during the project's third month. Multiple factors likely contributed to this decline. The harsh New England winter climate naturally discourages cycling and walking commuters. Additionally, December's academic pressures, including final examinations and grading periods, combined with holiday preparations and extended breaks, may have reduced participation. The late January resumption of classes also correlates with diminished log submissions. However, these factors alone cannot fully explain February's unexpectedly low participation rates.\n\nSuch initiatives often demonstrate strong initial enthusiasm followed by waning engagement. To counter this pattern, our team implemented a focused \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, successfully boosting participation rates. This experience highlighted two key operational challenges: sustaining momentum despite natural engagement decline, and adapting to academic calendar disruptions inherent to educational institutions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative transportation initiatives lies in American society's deep-rooted automotive culture, which values personal mobility and convenience. Our incentive strategy included distributing various gift certificates to local establishments - restaurants, cafes, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating progressively valuable rewards might have better sustained participation. While initial gift card offerings proved adequate, introducing more substantial prizes - such as premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - could have prevented participation decline. A tiered reward structure, announcing increasingly valuable prizes throughout the project timeline, might have maintained or even enhanced engagement levels instead of experiencing the observed downturn.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I explored their collection of early Edison trick films, encompassing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces demonstrate the innovative use of editing techniques to create magical illusions. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unexpected deviations in these early cinematic experiments.\n\nThe majority of these productions adhered to specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a static camera positioned like a theatrical audience, and maintained consistent distance from their subjects. Most significantly, they typically consisted of what appeared to be a single continuous take. However, as the new century dawned, several bold filmmakers began challenging these established norms by incorporating multiple distinct scenes.\n\nWhat stands out immediately is the theatrical staging of these productions. The camera remains stationary, as if representing an audience member's fixed perspective, while the action unfolds within a defined performance space. This approach clearly reflects the influence of stage performances, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where performers move laterally across the frame, never approaching or retreating from the viewing position - much like actors confined to a physical stage.\n\nThis theatrical influence extends to shot composition as well. The films consistently employ wide and occasional medium-distance views, completely avoiding close-range shots. This mirrors the live theater experience, where audiences observe the entire stage simultaneously. The performers maintain their distance from the camera, preserving the illusion of watching a stage production.\n\nThese early works typically presented what seemed to be one continuous scene, usually lasting no more than sixty seconds. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, resulting in brief, vaudeville-style demonstrations focusing on magical transformations and disappearances rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that many of these apparently continuous scenes actually comprised multiple shots cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful examination reveals the precise moment where separate shots were combined to create the illusion.",
            "Literary scholars often note the fascinating contradiction inherent in Gothic fiction's nomenclature, as it represents a fusion of antiquated and contemporary elements. This genre has experienced varying degrees of critical reception throughout history, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.' When Horace Walpole published The Castle of Otranto, widely acknowledged as the first Gothic novel, he deliberately merged classical romantic conventions with modern narrative techniques, establishing a groundbreaking literary framework.\n\nThe term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations even during Otranto's publication era, referencing diverse cultural and architectural elements from medieval periods. Despite being considered somewhat primitive compared to contemporary literary developments, the genre's unique combination of theatrical elements and psychological depth has granted it remarkable staying power, allowing it to feel simultaneously dated and fresh to modern readers.\n\nMedieval chivalric traditions play a central role in Gothic literature's thematic foundation. In Otranto, these ideals undergo both preservation and transformation. The emphasis on chivalric values reflects a broader cultural commentary, as authors like Walpole observed what they perceived as moral decay in their contemporary society. Writing during politically turbulent times, Walpole's work suggests a nostalgic yearning for the perceived moral certainties of medieval times.\n\nThis perspective manifests clearly in characters such as Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. His characterization as a noble prince who endures hardship and faces presumed death at the hands of non-believers exemplifies the genre's tendency toward melodramatic excess while maintaining core chivalric ideals. This portrayal demonstrates how Gothic fiction often amplified traditional heroic qualities to create its distinctive atmosphere.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer orders through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first articulated by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, describes a comprehensive framework for orchestrating and monitoring supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements efficiently. The discipline rests on six fundamental pillars: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock management, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodology of production processes. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the most reliable indicator of demand patterns. Upon completing market research and gaining clarity on consumer requirements, decision-makers can determine product specifications and production volumes. Subsequently, they select optimal manufacturing locations based on capacity requirements and quality standards, while maintaining focus on consumer satisfaction metrics. The final manufacturing considerations involve workflow scheduling and equipment maintenance protocols. The manufacturing phase demands meticulous attention to detail, as oversights can result in significant financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized procedures - from dress codes to receiving protocols - facilitate smooth operations.\n\nResource procurement, the second pillar, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Organizations often maintain multiple production divisions for single product lines, each equipped with specialized machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division assignments for various production phases. Additionally, they may opt for external partnerships to enhance velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while achieving or preserving cost efficiencies.",
            "The literary landscape of Victorian England was dominated by narratives that meticulously detailed aristocratic life. However, two notable exceptions, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, deviate significantly from these conventions. These works distinguish themselves through their incorporation of supernatural elements and unconventional storytelling techniques, which serve to illuminate their characters' psychological depths and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (220)\n\nThese narratives frequently employ dream sequences as a literary device, though each author adapts this technique to their specific narrative purposes. In Oliver Twist, these surreal interludes function as windows into the protagonist's psyche, revealing his innermost turmoil and growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this effectively. The dreamlike recollection emphasizes his powerlessness while highlighting his deteriorating physical state, particularly through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting scene's sensory overload - where Oliver barely registers the \"unseen hand\" guiding him - underscores his complete disorientation. This persistent pain, now intertwined with fear rather than initial shock, suggests deeper psychological implications. The sequence raises questions about agency and fate, as Oliver's passive response indicates potential psychological manipulation by Fagin, who may have successfully instilled a sense of helplessness in the young protagonist.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my time as an elementary school tutor, I encountered a memorable situation that highlighted a significant educational challenge. While assisting students with various subjects, particularly reading and English, I was asked to help a third-grade student named Adrian. His reading difficulties presented an unusual pattern - he could pronounce certain letters perfectly but struggled inexplicably with others.\n\nDespite being from a Latino background, Adrian's spoken English was impeccable. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his mother while supervising remaining students during a field trip day. She communicated exclusively in Spanish, and through my basic Spanish skills, we managed a conversation. This interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's reading challenges stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet rather than comprehension issues.\n\nThis experience illuminates the complexities of language barriers in California's educational system. It demonstrates how language-related challenges can manifest in unexpected ways - even students with excellent verbal English skills may struggle with written language. While Adrian's situation required focused alphabet and pronunciation tutoring, many students face more substantial language barriers requiring comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe educational system needs a multi-faceted approach combining various strategies: dual-language programs, mainstream immersion, individualized tutoring, and ESL classes. Research demonstrates that two-way bilingual education programs yield superior academic results for all participants, not just non-native English speakers. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual might be impractical, incorporating bilingual educational support staff could create more inclusive and effective learning environments. This approach would benefit both English learners and native English speakers, fostering a more comprehensive educational experience.",
            "Since ancient times, humans have grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. Various paths lead to spiritual enlightenment: some find solace in churches, others in synagogues, while many seek answers through introspection. Though numerous individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions, others steadfastly reject such notions, embracing a more self-centered worldview. Our spiritual journey often involves trying different belief systems, sometimes discarding one for another. Each person's quest for meaning follows a unique trajectory, like countless paths leading toward illumination.\n\nI remember a conversation with Dad during a stormy afternoon. We were sheltered on the porch, cigarettes in hand, listening to raindrops drumming against the metal roofing. \"Cardinals,\" he answered when I inquired about his preferred avian species. Water cascaded from the gutters, drenching the botanical border below. His gaze wandered across the misty landscape, appearing both present and distant. Disease had ravaged his frame; clothing hung loose where it once fit snugly, and his formerly thick hair had grown sparse. Words about mortality remained unspoken between us - acknowledging them would make everything too tangible. Instead, I shifted closer, embracing him briefly before joining his contemplative watch of the summer shower.\n\nHis departure came in December, shortly after I turned twenty-two. Medical interventions prolonged his life beyond predictions, though their merit seemed questionable given his extended suffering. My faith wavered; the concept of a benevolent deity became increasingly difficult to reconcile with such cruel reality. Nighttime brought no comfort through prayer - any divine presence felt distant and indifferent.\n\nI made a conscious choice to avoid witnessing his final moments. Understanding him as intimately as I did, I knew he wouldn't want his child present for that transition. I chose to preserve memories of his vitality rather than his decline. While others gathered, I remained isolated in my bedroom for three days, awaiting inevitable news.\n\nThe silence of my phone spoke volumes.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideology stood John Taylor of Caroline, whose agricultural background and limited political experience shaped his passionate advocacy for individual liberties and governmental reform. His agricultural roots fundamentally influenced his perspectives on governance, sovereignty, constitutional matters, and judicial frameworks.\n\nThe absence of entrenched traditions in America presented, according to Taylor, an unprecedented opportunity to establish genuine self-governance. He emphasized the interconnected nature of human rights, arguing that these fundamental liberties must remain untouchable by governmental authority. In his view, while primitive societies might reward physical strength and cunning manipulation, civilized nations must transcend such base dynamics.\n\nTaylor's political philosophy centered on crafting governmental structures that could effectively manage humanity's moral dualism. His framework identified positive principles as those supporting private ownership, agricultural development, and resistance to unchecked capitalism. He theorized that properly designed systems would function effectively despite the inevitable human tendencies toward self-interest and personal gain. While acknowledging self-interest as a universal motivator, Taylor distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nRegarding constitutional interpretation, Taylor advocated for precise adherence while emphasizing contextual understanding. He supported minimal federal authority, limiting it strictly to explicitly granted powers, viewing extensive federal control as potentially tyrannical and financially burdensome. Notably, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as America's true founding document, believing it better reflected the sovereign nature of individual states rather than a unified nation.",
            "My eyes fixed upon the scene below, processing the visual input with clinical detachment. Like a computer scanning data, my brain registered the information without emotional interference, maintaining a professional distance from what lay before me. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness like fireflies on a summer evening, there and gone in an instant.\n\nI recalled my brief foray into artistic pursuits several years ago. A colleague had recommended Betty Edwards' celebrated instruction manual on drawing. The book's methodology included a fascinating technique of using viewfinders to isolate portions of complex scenes, effectively simplifying the visual chaos into manageable segments.\n\nBut in this moment, no such mental framing device could help compartmentalize what I witnessed. The sight commanded my full attention, demanding acknowledgment in its raw entirety. Just as the great masters had their signature palettes – Van Gogh's yellows, Vermeer's blues – before me lay the foundation of what could only be termed a masterwork in sepia tones.\n\nWith surgical precision, I initiated the first phase of my task. The porcelain canvas reflected the fluorescent lights above as water circulated in its pristine dance. Particles separated from the main mass, swept away in the current. A second, more forceful attempt at the lever yielded similar results – the stubborn creation remained steadfast in its position.\n\nThere I stood, in my retail uniform, contemplating the unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron of our establishment's facilities. After several unsuccessful attempts to restore order through conventional means, I resigned myself to more direct intervention. Methodically wrapping protective layers around my hand, I prepared for the inevitable. Like a surgeon approaching a delicate procedure, I leaned forward, extending my arm toward the waiting basin...",
            "Recent data reveals an alarming trend in vehicular fatalities among young drivers. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates that adolescent neural development significantly impacts driving capability. Moreover, the fundamental lack of road experience contributes substantially to various driving mishaps, from basic control issues to severe accidents.\n\nStudies, particularly one conducted by researchers at the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, highlight a concerning correlation between passenger age demographics and collision frequency. This finding becomes especially relevant when considering typical adolescent social patterns.\n\nWhile various jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing systems that restrict nighttime driving and passenger numbers, these solutions merely scratch the surface. Evidence suggests that fundamental neurological and behavioral patterns make young drivers inherently more susceptible to dangerous driving behaviors.\n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman's research, featured in USA Today, indicates that risk-taking behaviors peak during late adolescence, suggesting that even eighteen might be premature for full driving privileges. This insight becomes particularly relevant as demographic projections indicate a substantial increase in eligible young drivers, specifically children of Baby-Boomers approaching driving age.\n\nA potential solution lies in standardizing national driving requirements. This approach would maintain educational components while implementing more stringent age restrictions. The framework could incorporate existing state-level requirements - such as California's mandated training hours - into a comprehensive national standard. This proposal builds upon established practices rather than introducing entirely new concepts.\n\nCurrent data spanning multiple states indicates that a unified approach could significantly reduce youth driving fatalities. By implementing evidence-based restrictions and standardized training requirements, we could better protect our young population while maintaining necessary mobility options.",
            "In exploring Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), three fundamental aspects deserve attention. The initial segment explores the basic nature of this condition, followed by an examination of diagnostic procedures and warning signs. The discussion concludes by addressing practical strategies educators can implement to support CAPD students in mainstream educational settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, alternatively known as APD, represents a neurological condition affecting how the brain processes auditory signals. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's 2005 report, this condition impacts the central nervous system's ability to effectively utilize sound information. Notably, individuals with CAPD maintain normal hearing capabilities but struggle with processing auditory input, such as distinguishing speech from ambient noise or processing individual words within conversations.\n\nHistorical records trace the disorder's recognition to mid-twentieth century studies. Initially termed \"auditory imperception,\" CAPD garnered attention when researchers examined communication disorders in children. Significant developments emerged in 1954 through pioneering work by Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari. Later advances came from Kimura's 1961 introduction of dichotic testing methodologies. A watershed moment occurred in 1977 when a national symposium catalyzed extensive research initiatives.\n\nCAPD symptoms encompass various challenges. Affected individuals might struggle with sound localization, experience difficulty distinguishing between concurrent sounds, or fail to recognize acoustic patterns. Additional manifestations include challenges in detecting vocal nuances that convey meaning, such as sarcastic tones. Some patients experience auditory masking, where subsequent sounds override previous ones. Furthermore, individuals might face challenges in processing sound information sequentially or synthesizing acoustic information meaningfully.\n\nDiagnostic procedures typically involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments incorporate behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. Currently, no singular diagnostic tool definitively confirms CAPD, and its underlying causes remain uncertain. Contemporary testing methods often employ simultaneous auditory stimuli, requiring patients to differentiate specific elements like word sequences or numerical patterns. Advanced diagnostic techniques include analyzing inner ear acoustic responses to various signals.",
            "My aspiration to join the Division of Family and Children Services stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for vulnerable youth and support families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation was not straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with personal challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping strategies. These observations guided me toward completing my Psychology degree at Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse. This experience catalyzed my involvement in a situation where I leveraged my psychology background to mediate between law enforcement and the youth's parents. The parents' dismissive attitude toward what they termed \"simple\" disputes revealed the critical need for professional intervention in family dynamics, solidifying my resolve to pursue social work.\n\nMy dedication to social justice extends beyond professional aspirations. Contemporary society presents a paradox: while claiming to value individuality, it often promotes conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I actively challenged societal norms through various forms of self-expression - from unconventional appearance choices to advocating for LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA participation. My commitment to combating discrimination and promoting equality remains unwavering. This dedication to authentic self-expression and advocacy for marginalized communities continues to drive my professional pursuits in social work.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through both biological and sociocultural perspectives. While biological frameworks emphasize hereditary and medical factors, sociocultural approaches examine how environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables, impact sleep patterns.\n\nSleep disorders fall into several distinct categories. The first encompasses primary sleep disorders, followed by those connected to existing mental health conditions, and finally, those stemming from other causes. Primary sleep disorders branch into two subcategories: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Mental health-related sleep disturbances typically connect to either Axis I or Axis II conditions, while other sleep issues may result from medical conditions or substance use.\n\nWithin the Dyssomnia category, we find several conditions: Primary Insomnia (difficulty sleeping), Primary Hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), Narcolepsy (involving cataplexy and REM irregularities), Breathing-Related Sleep Issues, Circadian Rhythm Disruptions, and unspecified cases. Parasomnias, on the other hand, manifest as behavioral or physiological anomalies during sleep, including nightmares, night terrors, sleepwalking, and other unclassified conditions.\n\nRecent research has revealed fascinating biological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Scientists have identified specific neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin that control sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with mice have demonstrated that GABAB receptors on these neurons play a crucial role in sleep regulation. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, sleep was promoted, while GABAB agonists increased overall sleep duration. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep patterns and hereditary sleep disorders, highlighting how genetic factors might influence an individual's ability to maintain healthy sleep patterns without pharmaceutical intervention.",
            "After spending five semesters at University Park, I've gained considerable perspective on the transportation challenges that plague our expanding campus. During my initial year, I resided in Stuart Hall within East Halls complex - a location that sits at the campus's eastern periphery. The journey to central campus locations, such as Willard building, could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nThe campus landscape has undergone significant transformation recently. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls once stood isolated, separated from main campus by vast empty spaces. Now, those areas house athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, plus numerous residential developments. This expansion has only intensified the challenge of campus navigation.\n\nIn addressing these mobility issues, bicycles emerge as the optimal solution for university environments. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after abandoning it for several years. Their enthusiasm was palpable as they noted, \"It's remarkable how cycling has regained its practical appeal - it's truly the most effective transportation method available.\" Beyond its health advantages, cycling represents unprecedented efficiency in human-powered transportation, with minimal fuel requirements beyond basic nutrition.\n\nAs an off-campus resident situated at a distance comparable to some university housing, I can attest to cycling's benefits. My daily commute to Thomas building, typically a 25-minute walk, reduces to merely 5 minutes by bicycle. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my academic schedule demands greater efficiency. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 150 minutes weekly when considering various campus destinations - proves invaluable for maintaining academic and personal commitments.",
            "In his seminal work Brave New World, Huxley presents a haunting vision of society's future, where technological advancement and unbridled consumerism converge to create a nightmarish dystopia. The society depicted prioritizes collective harmony over individual identity, systematically programming its inhabitants to chase fleeting pleasures rather than meaningful fulfillment. These citizens, unknowingly manipulated by the shadowy World Controller, become mere instruments in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about industrial and economic systems of the era. The novel employs classic Marxist concepts - from collective consciousness to social stratification - to highlight the author's growing unease with contemporary societal developments.\n\nThe narrative particularly emphasizes the concept of manufactured consent, where citizens remain blissfully unaware of their true economic relationships. Through sophisticated conditioning techniques, particularly hypnopædia, the lower castes (Deltas, Gammas) are programmed to embrace consumerist behaviors, perpetually pursuing material satisfaction. This manipulation, orchestrated by the World Controller, exemplifies social dominance theory, where elite groups maintain control through subtle yet pervasive means. The higher castes (Alphas, Betas), despite their enhanced cognitive capabilities, largely accept this system, with few exceptions like Bernard questioning the status quo.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the novel's portrayal of human connections - or rather, their absence. Characters appear deliberately two-dimensional, suggesting that technological progress and consumer culture have stripped humanity of its emotional depth. Authentic love is notably absent; instead, relationships are reduced to superficial physical encounters, with men objectifying women's \"pneumatic\" qualities and women casually discussing their liaisons. This emotional flatness, combined with each caste's acceptance of their predetermined role, illustrates how consumer capitalism creates a docile population, content to fulfill their prescribed social functions while maintaining the illusion of personal satisfaction.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that delved into Islamic studies. A recurring theme throughout the semester centered on the perception of Islam in contemporary society. This discussion has only grown more significant in our current political climate. The media's portrayal of Islam has undergone a remarkable transformation since the early 2000s, shifting from overt skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation. This evolution in public sentiment perhaps culminated in the unprecedented candidacy of a presidential hopeful with Islamic familial connections.\n\nThe historical accounts of the Prophet's life present fascinating contradictions that warrant closer examination. Traditional historical records suggest a figure who expanded his influence through military conquest and mandatory religious conversion. However, the biographical texts paint a markedly different picture - one of a misunderstood spiritual leader whose followers came to him voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nWhat stands out particularly are the parallel narratives between Islamic and Christian traditions. One notable example describes the multiplication of food to feed a multitude, bearing striking resemblance to well-documented Christian miracles. This apparent mirroring of sacred events raises questions about the authenticity and originality of these accounts.\n\nThe biographical sources frequently employ a distinctive narrative technique, relying heavily on chains of oral transmission to establish credibility. While this methodology aims to validate the accounts through multiple attestations, it paradoxically introduces elements of uncertainty due to the extended chain of narrators separating the events from their documentation.\n\nThe disparity between historical evidence and biographical portrayal creates a significant cognitive dissonance. While the biographical accounts present an image of a benevolent and humble leader, historical records suggest a more complex figure who employed various means to establish and maintain authority. This raises important questions about historical accuracy and contemporary understanding within the Islamic community.",
            "Historical analysis reveals a substantial divergence between the original teachings of Jesus and subsequent Christian theological developments. This evolution of Christian doctrine demonstrates an increasing departure from its foundational principles. Contemporary society exhibits remarkable progress in understanding and questioning traditional religious interpretations. Although conservative elements persist in maintaining conventional interpretations, their influence appears to be diminishing within the broader social context.\n\nScholars anticipate a significant surge in historical consciousness among Christian communities. This awakening will likely foster a desire to separate later theological additions from Jesus's original message. While this transformation may span generations, its culmination appears inevitable: Christianity will experience a fundamental restructuring, gravitating toward its historical roots. This movement will systematically deconstruct accumulated doctrinal layers, ultimately revealing Jesus's pure theological vision, unencumbered by subsequent interpretations.\n\nAs this theological reformation sweeps across Western societies, inspiring congregations to embrace practices reminiscent of first-century Christianity, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their significance while adapting to this paradigm shift. The current denominational diversity will likely converge toward a more unified expression of faith. Historical precedents for such dramatic transformations exist: consider Rome's evolution from persecuting Christians to embracing Christianity, or America's journey from slavery to racial inclusion in leadership.\n\nThis anticipated religious reformation will necessitate a sophisticated hermeneutical approach, particularly in interpreting Jesus's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To comprehend this evolution, we must examine Christianity's origins in Judaism. Prior to Rome's occupation of Jerusalem in 63 BCE, Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority. The Jewish community, however, was not monolithic, encompassing diverse groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through a critical analysis of The Jungle, one can observe a profound commentary on humanity's inherent disposition toward avarice and self-preservation. The narrative expertly illustrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of authority, consistently prioritize personal advancement while disregarding the welfare of their subordinates. This phenomenon manifests most prominently in the conduct of industrial magnates and their administrative personnel.\n\nThese powerful figures demonstrate an unwavering commitment to corporate expansion and profit maximization, exhibiting complete indifference to the collateral damage inflicted upon both society and the environment. As Sinclair vividly depicts, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery serves as a metaphor for the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization, highlighting the manufacturers' blatant disregard for ecological consequences, including atmospheric pollution and unsanitary conditions stemming from livestock facilities.\n\nThe exploitation extends beyond environmental concerns to encompass labor relations. As the text states, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The absence of worker protection legislation during this historical period enabled management to subject employees to hazardous conditions and arbitrary termination without recourse. The laborers, predominantly immigrants living in perpetual economic uncertainty, found themselves trapped in a system reminiscent of institutionalized servitude. As Sinclair observes, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Literary scholars have long debated the influences behind Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land.\" The recurring mention of \"Thulé\" within the poem presents an intriguing connection to classical literature. While some academics point to Virgil's use of the term - describing a mysterious northern isle beyond Britain's shores - a more compelling source emerges from German literature.\n\nThe connection between Poe's work and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust\" (published in two segments: 1808 and 1832) deserves particular attention. Within \"Faust Part Two,\" Goethe crafts \"The King of Thulé,\" a haunting narrative about a bereaved monarch. This ruler, having received a goblet from his dying queen, descends into grief-stricken drinking before ultimately choosing death, keeping only the meaningful chalice while distributing his other possessions to his heirs. His final act - casting the goblet into the ocean before his own death - resonates deeply with themes found in Poe's writings.\n\nThe thematic parallels between these works are striking. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" explore realms of profound loss, isolation, and darkness. Poe's narrator traverses a colorless landscape populated by ghostly remembrances, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's monarch. Notably, Poe employs \"Thule\" in both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" suggesting a deliberate literary connection.\n\nGoethe's influence on nineteenth-century literature was considerable, and Poe's appreciation for contemporary European writers, particularly Tennyson (himself an admirer of Goethe), suggests he would have been well-versed in the German master's works. The proliferation of Goethe translations and adaptations during this period, including H.P. Grattan's 1842 dramatic interpretation of \"Faust,\" would have made these works readily accessible to American literary circles.",
            "I'm analyzing whether punitive damages could be awarded in a California slip-and-fall case where store management displayed potential negligence regarding a hazardous situation.\n\nThe incident occurred at D&D Markets when customer Jennifer Palmer suffered a severe back injury after slipping on spilled applesauce. The critical element here is that two separate employees had notified Manager Paul Martin about the hazard, yet he chose to continue his dinner break rather than address the situation. The spill remained unattended for approximately 30 minutes before the accident occurred.\n\nThe legal framework in California permits punitive damages when defendants exhibit \"oppression, fraud or malice\" (California Civil Code 3294(a)). In this context, malice encompasses both intentional harm and \"despicable conduct\" showing conscious disregard for safety. Precedent indicates that awareness of probable dangers combined with deliberate inaction can constitute malicious conduct (reference: Taylor v. Superior Court).\n\nSeveral factors strengthen the case for punitive damages. First, D&D Markets had experienced five previous slip-and-fall incidents that same year, establishing a pattern of safety concerns. Second, Martin's repeated dismissal of employee warnings demonstrates conscious disregard for customer safety. While proving \"despicable conduct\" presents challenges, Martin's prioritization of his dinner break over addressing a known safety hazard, especially given the store's history of similar incidents, provides reasonable grounds for pursuing punitive damages.\n\nBased on these considerations, a court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed past summary judgment, though success at trial would depend on effectively demonstrating Martin's conscious disregard for customer safety.",
            "The emptiness gnawed at her consciousness since puberty struck. From the tender age of fourteen through her current seventeen years, an inexplicable void persisted within her soul. Eventually, she recognized that this yearning wasn't for an object but for companionship. Curiously though, despite numerous advances from potential suitors, no male ever sparked her interest. This peculiarity prompted countless hours of introspection, yet no satisfactory explanation emerged to illuminate this romantic anomaly.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere in which she dwelled typically exuded tranquility. Her parents, paragons of serenity, rarely engaged in confrontations, either with each other or their offspring. The sole source of friction arose from her assertions of autonomy - a natural byproduct of her vibrant personality, which stood in stark contrast to her parents' placid demeanor. Her effervescent nature, coupled with genuine kindness, endeared her to many.\n\nThe day's peaceful facade shattered with an unexpected shriek emanating from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice, now distorted by pain, pierced the air. Rushing to investigate, she discovered her maternal figure sprawled across the floor, each breath punctuated by agonized gasps. \"Hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths. Drawing upon strength cultivated through dedicated training, she carefully transported her injured mother to their vehicle, positioning her gently across the back seat before embarking on an urgent journey.\n\nThe clinical environment of the emergency room, with its characteristic antiseptic atmosphere and underlying current of anxiety, barely registered in her consciousness. Her singular focus remained on securing immediate medical attention for her mother. After facilitating a swift transfer onto a gurney, she watched helplessly as medical personnel whisked her mother away for evaluation.\n\nThe catalyst for this crisis? A simple domestic accident - her mother's unfortunate tumble from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a decorative vessel from an elevated storage space.",
            "Recent research explores the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns resembling traditional Mediterranean cuisine. Investigators aimed to evaluate whether individuals following Mediterranean-inspired eating habits, quantified through an adapted scoring system (aMed), experienced reduced instances of heart disease, stroke occurrences, and related fatalities.\n\nThe aMed framework emphasizes abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and proteins derived from plants and fish, while limiting animal-based products. It promotes the use of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats over saturated alternatives and permits reasonable alcohol consumption.\n\nEarlier investigations revealed promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating patterns and decreased mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes. One notable experiment demonstrated superior outcomes in obese participants following Mediterranean guidelines compared to low-fat dietary restrictions, specifically regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles. However, these previous analyses hadn't specifically targeted stroke-related outcomes.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals, aged 38-63, participating in a broader health assessment initiative across 11 American states. Researchers collected dietary information through detailed questionnaires at six intervals between 1984 and 2004, maintaining an impressive 95% participant retention rate. The team verified reported cardiovascular events through medical documentation, with approximately one-fifth classified as probable cases when complete records weren't available.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of dietary adherence scores and accounted for various lifestyle factors, including exercise habits, smoking status, and hormone therapy use. Statistical analysis employed Cox proportional-hazard models to evaluate relationships between dietary patterns and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective benefits among participants demonstrating stronger Mediterranean diet adherence. Throughout the two-decade observation period, researchers documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths. Statistical analysis indicated that participants with the highest dietary compliance experienced 29% lower risk compared to those with minimal adherence.",
            "A solitary figure emerges from the urban landscape - actress Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, displaying a peculiar message board overhead. The text, drafted in permanent marker, makes an outlandish claim about Hitler's whereabouts in Myanmar.\n\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has endured decades of military control since a 1962 military takeover. The nation witnessed unprecedented civil unrest in 2007, marked by what became known as the \"Saffron Revolution\" - named for the distinctive garments worn by Buddhist monks who initiated the demonstrations. As public participation swelled, the initially tolerant military regime's response grew increasingly hostile, culminating in widespread monastery raids and violent confrontations.\n\nInternational media faced severe restrictions, with journalists facing immediate detention. The situation turned deadly when Kenji Nagai, a photojournalist from Japan, lost his life while documenting a demonstration on September 27th, 2007. Although official records indicate only 13 casualties, a military defector, Colonel Hla Win, suggested the actual death count reached thousands.\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine authority, while Japanese imperial tradition ascribed godlike status to their rulers. Even modern governance shows traces of authoritarian tendencies, as exemplified by certain political-religious alliances in contemporary America.\n\nHistorical precedents include China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, where peaceful demonstrators faced military intervention. Casualty estimates vary dramatically - Chinese authorities claim 200-300 deaths, while Red Cross data suggests 2,000-3,000 perished. The 1990s Rwandan crisis saw systematic elimination of Tutsis and moderate politicians by Hutu militias with government support. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany represents another devastating example of state-sponsored persecution.",
            "The remarkable impact of Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his enduring career and extraordinary talent for orchestral innovation. While his piano work often maintains a delicate presence in many compositions, his true genius manifested in creating intricate musical pieces that brilliantly showcased his musicians' individual talents. The maestro developed sophisticated frameworks allowing for both spontaneous improvisation and meticulously arranged segments, carefully tailored to highlight each performer's unique stylistic approach. This methodology resulted in distinctive orchestral signatures that perfectly complemented each composition's character. His profound understanding of both individual musicians and ensemble dynamics enabled him to produce some of jazz's most groundbreaking compositions.\n\nAccording to Grove Music's scholarly analysis, compositions like \"Creole Love Call\" exemplify Ellington's pioneering approach to incorporating vocals as instrumental elements throughout his musical journey. This piece demonstrates his exceptional ability to enhance soloists' performances, a skill that remained constant throughout his career. The composition, structured as a measured twelve-bar blues, unfolds through six distinct choruses:\n\nInitial Chorus: Interplay between vocals and woodwinds, transitioning from fluid melody to textured timbre\nSecond Chorus: Dampened trumpet elaborating the core melody with extended blue notes\nThird Chorus: High-register clarinet solo floating above subtle syncopated piano\nFourth Chorus: Full orchestral interpretation featuring brass and reed section dialogue\nFifth Chorus: Climactic movement with high-register reed initiation backed by brass and rhythm\nFinal Chorus: Return to vocal-reed dialogue with instrumental-style vocal growls\nConclusion: Short vocal passage ending with dissonant trombone flourish\n\nThis innovative vocal incorporation represents just one facet of Ellington's distinctive musical vocabulary. Later works like \"Hot and Bothered\" showcase his masterful orchestration combined with tonal exploration, featuring remarkable interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scatting. Similarly, \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" demonstrates his brilliant utilization of Nanton's trombone prowess in establishing the melodic foundation.",
            "What mechanisms drive evolutionary patterns in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the boundaries that shape evolutionary trajectories. Nearly a century after D'Arcy Thompson lamented the lack of mathematical frameworks in biological form studies, this challenge persists. Contemporary research has made strides in applying quantitative approaches to understand mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution.\n\nOur research investigates Prunum specimens using mathematical frameworks combined with empirical observations. By analyzing X-ray images of various Prunum species, we extracted numerical parameters to construct both theoretical and actual shell configurations using CerioShell software. This approach enables us to explore the theoretical limits of morphological variation within this genus, complementing our laboratory studies to illuminate major evolutionary transitions.\n\nUnderstanding shell architecture requires recognizing it as a helical structure rotating through space. The spiral components, known as whorls, encircle a central columella. Shell growth patterns exhibit varying expansion rates, with distinct suture lines marking whorl boundaries. The final whorl, termed the body whorl, typically achieves the greatest diameter. Above it lies the spire, comprising earlier whorls, terminating in the apex. The base occupies the opposite end, featuring the aperture through which the organism extends.\n\nShell examination typically involves four perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard presentation shows the apertural view, displaying the opening while positioning the apex upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a systematic protocol. Beginning with an apical perspective, observers locate the initial suture point. A reference line bisects the shell, allowing whorl counts in quarter-turn increments from this starting point.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a sequence of apertures progressing through three-dimensional space during calcium carbonate deposition. This growth pattern can be mapped using aperture center coordinates and dimensional measurements.\n\nSuch spatial progressions yield both visual and mathematical representations. These models facilitate parameter manipulation, allowing exploration of alternative developmental pathways in mollusk shell formation.",
            "During the past decade, Indonesia's infant and newborn death rates have shown minimal fluctuation. Despite making progress on various Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation initiatives, the nation struggles significantly with improving maternal and child health metrics. These challenges, which will be examined in detail, suggest that strengthening the broader healthcare infrastructure might prove more beneficial than implementing targeted programs.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has achieved a 72% rate of professionally attended births, this statistic warrants closer scrutiny. Many of these attendants are traditional practitioners, including local midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications like severe bleeding during childbirth. Furthermore, recent data shows declining professional medical intervention rates for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions. The limited available information regarding post-birth care also indicates substantial inadequacies nationwide.\n\nSurgical birth procedures remain unexpectedly low at approximately 4% overall, with notable disparities between regions. Urban areas maintain a 7% cesarean delivery rate, while rural regions report only 2%, highlighting significant geographical healthcare inequities. Socioeconomic factors also play a crucial role, with a substantial 27% difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant healthcare metrics, policymakers face a fundamental choice between targeted interventions and comprehensive healthcare system reform. While specialized programs offer appealing advantages, including clearer objectives and quicker results, they present notable challenges. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health sectors, as evidenced by how international HIV/AIDS funding has impacted family planning initiatives. Moreover, multiple parallel programs frequently create redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, resulting in excessive bureaucratic procedures for resource allocation and management.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing an ever-growing array of musical styles and categories. Within this vast landscape, numerous primary genres - including hip-hop, rock, country, jazz, and folk music - have evolved into intricate networks of specialized subgenres. Perhaps most notably, Heavy Metal has emerged as an exceptionally rich and nuanced form of musical expression since its inception four decades ago. While often associated with darker emotional themes, Metal's versatility has allowed it to branch into countless distinctive variations, with new subgenres continuously emerging as artists explore its creative boundaries.\n\nContemporary Heavy Metal presents such a complex tapestry of musical styles that defining its essential characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has assimilated elements from various musical traditions, understanding its current form requires examining its origins. The genre represents more than just a musical category - it constitutes a genuine cultural movement.\n\nThe essence of Metal lies in its embrace of extremes. It pushes boundaries across multiple dimensions: amplification, instrumental virtuosity, theatrical presentation, and emotional intensity. Musicians within this genre typically demonstrate exceptional technical proficiency, setting it apart from more primitive musical forms. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic culture of the 1970s, when artists, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal introduced a raw, visceral quality previously absent from mainstream music, and later iterations drew inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic-era compositions. Consider the dark themes evident in \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of Heavy Metal's precursors. This Beatles track, created as a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier sound, demonstrated the band's ability to embrace darker, more intense musical elements, earning its place on their White Album.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, exemplifies both the literal representation of a woman experiencing a mystical dreamscape and the metaphorical manifestation of Rousseau's professional aspirations. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau grappled with the fundamental tension between conforming to established artistic conventions to gain acceptance and following his unique creative instincts.\n\nUnderstanding the context of Rousseau's life illuminates the significance of The Dream. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau emerged from a middle-class background, his father being a moderately successful hardware merchant. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau never received formal artistic training. Instead, he spent four decades working as a municipal toll collector, often mistakenly referred to as a customs officer. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - his first marriage to Clémence ended in profound sorrow, with the loss of eight children in infancy, leaving only his daughter Julia. Art became his sanctuary, a means of processing grief and seeking new purpose. His artistic perspective reflected his working-class origins, offering an authentic rather than romanticized view of ordinary life.\n\nThe timing of Rousseau's artistic career posed unique challenges. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of numerous accomplished modernist painters. Despite years of dedication, recognition eluded him until approximately the same period when Henri Matisse was establishing his reputation. The contrast between these contemporary artists was striking: while Matisse actively sought to revolutionize artistic expression, Rousseau paradoxically strived for conventional acceptance within the established art community, as noted by art critic Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters.",
            "The relationship between moral principles and artistic expression has long fascinated scholars and philosophers. This connection runs deeper than mere coincidence. While conventional wisdom suggests that learning primarily occurs through formal education or direct experience, our understanding of ethics and artistic beauty seems to develop through different channels. Instead of following prescribed rules, both fields focus on explaining why certain actions are considered moral or why particular works resonate as beautiful.\n\nWhen analyzing artistic or moral merit, we often encounter limitations in fully articulating their essence. Consider how art critics discuss masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - they might reference technical elements such as composition or historical significance, yet these explanations rarely capture the artwork's true impact. Similarly, when people describe their favorite artistic works, they frequently preface their analysis with phrases acknowledging an ineffable quality that defies complete explanation.\n\nThis parallel between artistic appreciation and moral understanding extends beyond surface-level similarities. Both domains possess an element that transcends conventional description or analysis. Literary works, in particular, demonstrate this phenomenon clearly - no matter how thoroughly we analyze their components, something intangible remains beyond our grasp. This elusive quality appears in both artistic expression and ethical understanding, suggesting a fundamental connection between these two spheres of human experience.\n\nThe intersection of morality and artistic expression becomes particularly evident in literature. Unlike other art forms, literature inherently incorporates moral dimensions that mirror life itself. Our engagement with literary works often centers on their value systems and ethical implications, making them uniquely positioned to explore and illuminate moral questions. This special characteristic of literature - its ability to engage with moral considerations while maintaining artistic merit - highlights the intrinsic connection between aesthetic and ethical understanding.",
            "Modern-day Germany stands as a powerhouse nation, weaving together diverse regional identities from Munich's alpine surroundings to the northern maritime culture of Kiel. This cultural tapestry stretches across the nation, connecting cities like Cologne along the Rhine to Dresden's historic streets by the Elbe. The rich mosaic of contemporary German society reflects its complex origins, rooted in various ancient peoples and tribal confederations.\n\nThe ancestral homeland known as Germania has sparked considerable academic debate regarding its nomenclature. Historical records indicate multiple potential origins: the Tungri tribe theory proposed by Tacitus, Caesar's adoption of Gallic terminology during his campaigns, and linguistic connections to ancient weapons or behavioral characteristics. The term \"Germanus\" emerged prominently in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, where he documented frequent conflicts between Gallic peoples and tribes beyond the Rhine frontier.\n\nAncient documentation provides fascinating insights into Germania's early inhabitants. Tacitus's seminal work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (98 CE) presents a compelling argument for the indigenous nature of Germanic peoples, suggesting their isolation and distinctive character. He emphasized the region's challenging environment and questioned why anyone would willingly migrate to such harsh territory unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania remained primarily transactional. While Roman expeditions ventured into Germanic territories for resources and military campaigns, permanent Roman settlement proved limited. Germanic tribes established themselves as significant players along the empire's frontiers during the first century CE, engaging in trade and military service with Rome while maintaining their independence (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The resolution of such pretense often forces an uncomfortable choice between maintaining relationships and reclaiming one's true identity, as those deceived may react with varying degrees of acceptance or hostility.\n\nThe narrative particularly scrutinizes gender-based deception, raising fundamental questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine dress emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy inadvertently severs potential feminine alliances.\n\nThis masquerade generates unforeseen complications, notably Olivia's misplaced affections: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Furthermore, it creates an intricate emotional entanglement with Orsino, evidenced in his words: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nContemporary interpretations might view the play as an examination of how artifice can catalyze the emergence of latent desires, particularly regarding Olivia and Orsino's reactions to Viola's disguise. Their responses potentially suggest unexplored aspects of their own identities. However, Olivia's character appears more likely constructed as Shakespeare's commentary on superficial attraction rather than deeper identity questions. This interpretation gains credence through her swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, and her ultimate familial acceptance of Viola: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "Scholars have frequently highlighted the extreme measures employed in Germany's colonial territories, particularly regarding the systematic elimination of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, it would be an oversimplification to characterize the entire German colonial experience through this single lens. The empire's administrative approaches and educational initiatives varied substantially across its diverse territories.\n\nWhen British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) following World War I, they encountered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other territories by writers of the era. However, the educational landscape in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) told a markedly different story.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational framework established in East Africa, South West African authorities delegated native education almost exclusively to religious organizations, offering minimal governmental assistance. Conversely, substantial resources were allocated to European education in the territory, including state-run schools and enhanced support for missionary institutions serving white settlers. This educational disparity created lasting implications, with South West Africa's indigenous population remaining largely unschooled while other former German colonies produced numerous educated individuals.\n\nThe academic literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, though predominantly written in German during or shortly after colonial rule. Initial studies focused primarily on describing educational structures, while subsequent English-language research has offered comparative analyses and deeper exploration of specific educational aspects. Notable among these is Cohen's comparative study of South West and East African educational systems, which attributes many of South West Africa's distinctive educational characteristics to its substantial settler population.\n\nThe territory's relatively moderate climate, despite its predominantly desert landscape, attracted significant European settlement. By 1913, South West Africa hosted nearly 15,000 European residents, almost triple the white population of East Africa, the next most heavily settled German colony.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that characterized their relationship for nearly six decades (Diehl and Goerts 2000, 145). The relationship reached its most contentious point during the 1846-1848 conflict, when American forces conquered Mexican territories, including Texas and what would become the Southwest. Prior to World War I, numerous confrontations occurred between these neighboring nations, sparked by fundamental differences in faith, societal values, and competing national interests (Schmitt 1974, 30-31).\n\nSuch patterns of conflict often emerge between adjacent nations. Geographic proximity frequently breeds competition over resources and influence, as demonstrated by countless historical examples. Mexico and Cuba stand out as particularly noteworthy cases of sustained diplomatic tension with the United States, as noted by Pletcher (1977, 41). Their proximity to American shores has contributed to these strained relationships, contrasting sharply with the generally positive connections maintained with other Latin American nations.\n\nFaith-based divisions played a crucial role in the discord. Frahm (2001, 86) notes that American opposition to Catholicism and monarchical rule in earlier centuries paralleled its later resistance to fascism and communism. Similar to how Cold War tensions combined ideological differences with practical concerns, religious disparities between Protestant America and Catholic Mexico intensified their rivalry. These religious tensions stemmed from historical Anglo-Spanish antagonisms, which the former colonies inherited and perpetuated.\n\nThroughout the 57-year period of rivalry, Diehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 distinct conflicts. Border security dominated these disputes, with cross-border criminal activity causing significant diplomatic strain. Both nations eventually deployed military forces to address these frontier challenges (Schmitt 1974, 97).\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico's economic dependence on the United States grew. According to Schmitt (1974, 109-110), American priorities shifted from territorial acquisition to economic influence in Mexico during the late 1800s, fundamentally altering the relationship's dynamic.",
            "In 2008, a rare medical condition struck without warning, transforming my life overnight. At that juncture, I was employed in healthcare, a career path I had selected primarily for its perceived stability. Growing up, I frequently heard people say, \"Healthcare jobs will never disappear - illness is a constant.\" Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I opted for the practical route into nursing.\n\nThe reality hit hard at age 46: unmarried, minimal savings, and suddenly incapacitated. Currently, after a decade and a half of relying on disability benefits, my personal possessions have dwindled to almost nothing. Daily survival requires constant effort, challenging both my sense of security and dignity. While uncertainty permeates every aspect of my existence, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. When facing genuine hardship, even the strongest individuals feel vulnerable.\n\nLife's challenges, whether minor or major, are inevitable. Despite careful planning, certain obstacles prove insurmountable without assistance. While I acknowledge the need to reduce dependence on federal programs in America - given their obvious deterioration - I advocate for strengthening community bonds rather than promoting isolation.\n\nSome political figures glorify self-reliance as America's founding principle. However, historical evidence suggests that mutual aid, respect, and resource-sharing were the true cornerstones of early American survival. Consider the westward expansion - success depended on collective effort, not individual prowess.\n\nPreparation remains crucial. My emergency supplies include medical equipment, water treatment solutions, protective materials, illumination devices, and non-perishable food items. Those with available land should consider small-scale agriculture and food preservation. Alternative heating methods, where feasible, provide additional security.\n\nHowever, the most valuable preparation may be cultivating relationships within your community.",
            "Buddhism emerged when a noble heir, later recognized as the Buddha, experienced spiritual awakening during the 5th or 6th century BCE. His enlightenment and subsequent teachings gave rise to various Buddhist traditions, with Theravada emerging as the most traditional branch. As this spiritual movement approaches its 2500th anniversary, modern practitioners would hardly recognize its original form. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual observed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony embraced by both religious officials and everyday followers, despite having no direct connection to the Buddha's original teachings. Such evolution extends beyond mere customs, reaching into the fundamental principles of salvation and spiritual liberation.\n\nThe Buddhist framework has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, with both clergy and lay followers modifying their interpretations of core principles in response to various pressures. These catalysts for change can be categorized in several ways: those originating within versus outside the Buddhist community, and those intended to harm versus those that influence unintentionally.\n\nTo properly analyze these transformations, we must establish clear definitions. Changes originating from Buddhist practitioners, regardless of their status, represent internal influences. Conversely, modifications stemming from non-Buddhist sources constitute external influences. Harmful pressures actively seek to undermine Buddhist practices, while neutral influences may affect the tradition without specific intent to help or harm.\n\nTo understand these evolutionary forces, one must first grasp Buddhism's foundational principles. Adherents seek guidance through three sacred elements: the Buddha himself, his teachings (Dhamma), and the monastic community (Sangha). The Dhamma encompasses three collections of sacred texts: the Suttas (discourses), Vinaya (monastic regulations), and Abhidhamma (philosophical analyses). Key concepts include the absence of an eternal self (Anatta), life's inherent challenges (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Understanding these principles enables escape from the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and freedom from desire (lobha), aversion (dosa), and ignorance (moha). While monastics follow numerous regulations, lay practitioners observe five basic ethical guidelines regarding harmful actions, dishonesty, theft, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Central to all practice are the four noble truths, beginning with life's fundamental challenges, their origin in attachment, and the possibility of transcendence."
