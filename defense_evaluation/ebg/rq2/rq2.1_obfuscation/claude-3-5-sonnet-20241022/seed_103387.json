            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The impact of cultural dynamics on negotiations cannot be understated, yet we must avoid oversimplification. Cultural frameworks resist simple categorization; they are fluid, multifaceted constructs that defy broad stereotypes. Rather than making sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, successful negotiators focus on understanding how specific cultural elements influence the discussion at hand. When we encounter unfamiliar cultural territories, we inevitably filter our observations through the lens of our own experiences.\n\nTo bridge cultural divides effectively, one must invest time in comprehensive research, from historical context to contemporary social norms. Success lies not in attempting to alter or critique these cultural foundations, but in adapting one's approach to work within established parameters. This becomes particularly crucial when operating from a position of lesser leverage or in unfamiliar territory. Demonstrating genuine respect for local customs and beliefs often serves as a catalyst for overcoming cultural obstacles.\n\nCultural considerations extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its distinct ethos, manifesting in various ways – from workplace scheduling preferences to communication hierarchies. These differences appear in numerous forms: dress requirements, management structures, and even charitable involvement policies. The American corporate landscape exemplifies this diversity, with marked variations not only between organizations but also across geographical locations and urban-suburban divides. While some societies may present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals subtle but significant internal variations.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides crucial insight into cultural motivations. In societies where collective harmony and reputation preservation are paramount, negotiators typically avoid actions that might compromise organizational or leadership standing. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may focus more intensely on securing advantageous terms. While these broad cultural patterns merit consideration, developing personal rapport with negotiating counterparts remains essential for optimal outcomes.",
            "In examining religious philosophical discourse, we encounter a fascinating dichotomy between two medieval thinkers' approaches to proving divine existence. The biblical assertion \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" serves as a launching point for both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas in their respective theological arguments. When evaluating their contrasting methodologies, we must operate within the framework of Christian theology, specifically addressing the Judeo-Christian conception of God, rather than entertaining broader theological possibilities.\n\nBoth philosophers, while contributing significantly to theological discourse, fall short of providing an exhaustive foundation for religious belief. Consider Anselm's methodology: he proposes an introspective approach to understanding divinity. His argument centers on the premise that our ability to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence. The core of his reasoning suggests that our cognitive capacity to understand the concept of God necessitates God's existence. This internal, contemplative approach emphasizes personal revelation over external validation.\n\nIn contrast, Aquinas develops a markedly different framework, constructing his argument on empirical foundations. His methodology aligns more closely with scientific reasoning, presenting five distinct logical pathways to prove divine existence. These \"Five Ways\" encompass observations about change, causation, necessity, perfection, and cosmic order. Aquinas's approach mirrors solving a complex equation - each variable leads inevitably to a divine constant. His reasoning suggests that just as one can deduce the properties of an unseen puzzle piece by examining the surrounding pieces and the overall image, one can logically demonstrate God's existence through observable phenomena.",
            "Literary works often employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In examining \"The Great Gatsby,\" one discovers that its creator employs an array of literary devices to achieve particular effects. The narrative occasionally features unconventional pairings of descriptors and objects, creating unique atmospheric qualities. Additionally, the work demonstrates masterful symbolic representation, particularly through its strategic deployment of chromatic imagery. Several hues - including aureate, verdant, alabaster/slate, and crimson/rose - carry significant weight throughout the narrative. The novel constructs deliberate color associations, specifically with ivory/ash and scarlet/blush tones, subsequently utilizing these established meanings to trigger specific emotional responses regarding key elements.\n\nThe ivory/ash spectrum within the text represents conformity, with the former suggesting refinement and social elevation, while the latter implies deterioration and staleness. This symbolic framework emerges early through persistent references. The narrative's socialites consistently appear in pristine attire - from the protagonist's attendance at lavish gatherings in pale garments to various characters' light-colored wardrobes. The sole deviation occurs during the description of elaborate festivities, where vibrant primary colors dominate. This color scheme extends beyond clothing to characterize mundane elements: metropolitan thoroughfares, guest registers, residential complexes - all described in pale or ashen tones. Similarly, ordinary individuals and locations receive these chromatic descriptors: privileged upbringings, industrial wastelands, anonymous immigrants, and aging vendors.\n\nFollowing this established symbolism, the author leverages these shades to denote mundanity or conformity. This technique becomes particularly evident in the portrayal of a central figure, whose repeated association with pale hues gradually transforms her from a distinctive individual into a mere trophy - an object of desire rather than a fully realized character. This chromatic characterization persists throughout pivotal scenes, reinforcing her role as more symbolic than substantial.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under ideal weather conditions, featuring abundant sunshine and temperate seasons. The region's farms yield an impressive array of produce, spanning from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh leafy vegetables and aromatic herbs. Local consumers demonstrate strong support for community-based agriculture, particularly organic operations, with demand frequently exceeding supply. These enterprises often extend beyond mere food production, welcoming visitors for educational tours and outdoor activities.\n\nModern agricultural ventures in this region can leverage various governmental support mechanisms while simultaneously fostering environmental stewardship. Such operations frequently incorporate public engagement through guided experiences and educational initiatives, creating multiple revenue streams.\n\nThe transition to organic farming practices presents both opportunities and challenges. While these methods promote ecological diversity and environmental health through chemical-free cultivation, they demand significant investments in labor and expertise. Farmers must navigate increased operational costs, from manual pest control to natural soil enrichment strategies. Additional conservation efforts, such as implementing rotational grazing systems and maintaining specific habitat conditions, further compound these expenses.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property bordering Potrero, California, adjacent to Cleveland National Forest. This diverse landscape encompasses chaparral, introduced Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodlands, falling within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone. The area falls under the jurisdiction of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which monitors numerous threatened species including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nHistorical records indicate indigenous occupation spanning millennia, followed by nineteenth-century settlement by ranchers and wood merchants. The land's heritage as a homestead suggests a history of pastoral and timber activities. This analysis employed current real estate listings and available conservation programs to evaluate viable strategies for sustainable agricultural operations, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection - one that transcends ordinary relationships. This special bond encompasses numerous emotional facets: affection, admiration, competition, and sometimes even malice. No one comprehends a sibling quite like another sibling, as they function almost like mirrors to one another. Crisis situations often reveal the true essence of these relationships, whether positive or negative. However, these revelations frequently come at significant personal cost. Understanding sibling dynamics means accepting responsibility for the outcomes they generate. When siblings observe each other, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than their public personas. Their genuine character emerges through their choices and subsequent results.\n\nIn analyzing \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" we witness this dynamic between two siblings navigating their complex relationship. Set against a richly detailed Southern backdrop, their story unfolds as an exercise in futility. The narrative culminates in a tragic scene where pride collides with devastating failure, resulting in a single survivor. The author conveys these themes through careful development of the older brother's character, the siblings' interactions, and first-person narration that reveals the protagonist's internal struggles and worldview - elements that significantly influence the story's trajectory.\n\nThe older brother's motivations stem primarily from his overwhelming pride. From his initial interactions with his younger brother Doodle through their final tragic encounter, he harbors complicated feelings about his sibling's limitations. He had envisioned teaching a brother various physical activities - swimming, climbing, and exploring the local wilderness. He longed for a companion to share adventures with, someone who could match his physical capabilities. These aspirations proved impossible given Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival. Physical exertion posed a significant risk to Doodle's health, crushing his brother's expectations. The protagonist's disappointment manifests darkly - he even contemplates infanticide at one point, revealing disturbing psychological depths. Yet Doodle's innocent smile transforms their relationship, suggesting that beneath the protagonist's pride lies genuine fraternal affection.",
            "Our cognitive apparatus - the mind - functions as an intricate system that processes and interprets information in remarkable ways. Throughout history, scholars have drawn various parallels to explain its operation, evolving from simple analogies like wax tablets to more sophisticated comparisons with modern computing systems. However, we must exercise caution with such comparisons, as they often fall short of capturing the mind's true complexity.\n\nThe journey of information through our neural pathways begins when our sense organs convert physical phenomena - whether tactile sensations, thermal energy, acoustic waves, or light particles - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through parallel processing streams. Consider viewing a geometric shape: elementary processing identifies basic attributes like hue and edges, while higher-order processing integrates this data with existing knowledge to facilitate rapid recognition.\n\nSelective attention mechanisms act as gatekeepers, determining which signals merit further cognitive resources. While countless sensory inputs bombard us continuously, these mechanisms filter out non-essential information. This explains why we might overlook mundane details like individual grass blades beneath our feet, yet instantly recognize our name in crowded, noisy environments. This filtering process occurs continuously across multiple processing stages.\n\nInformation storage occurs across several memory systems, including immediate sensory registers, temporary working memory, and permanent long-term storage. The encoding process varies by sensory modality. Take linguistic information: it can be encoded based on visual appearance, phonetic properties, or meaning. Research with various species suggests that working memory - which spans approximately twenty seconds - relies on reverberating neural circuits, while long-term storage likely involves protein structure modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks to explain knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurobiology. One prominent theory suggests that knowledge exists as interconnected conceptual nodes. Within this framework, related concepts form associative networks - for instance, linking furniture items like chairs and tables with their common properties, such as being wooden.",
            "The global economic landscape underwent a seismic shift during 2007 when a devastating financial catastrophe engulfed the United States. As unemployment figures soared and real estate values plummeted, numerous prominent financial institutions faced unprecedented challenges. This economic downturn continues to reverberate through our society, prompting critical examination of its origins and potential preventive measures for the future.\n\nThe catalyst for this economic tsunami can be traced to misguided regulatory decisions and institutional practices. Financial entities faced mounting pressure to distribute high-risk loans within an inadequately prepared market infrastructure. Subsequently, major government-sponsored enterprises like FNMA and FHLMC were compelled to process and restructure these mortgages into complex financial instruments. The eventual default cascade triggered a chain reaction, depleting bank reserves and contaminating the broader economic ecosystem.\n\nThe groundwork for this crisis emerged during the late 1990s under President Clinton's administration. Seeking to bolster public approval, his government implemented more lenient lending policies. Contemporary reporting by the New York Times' Steven Holmes highlighted FNMA's predicament, noting increased governmental pressure to expand credit accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes presciently warned about potential consequences during economic downturns, drawing parallels to previous financial sector interventions.\n\nMultiple elements converged to create this perfect storm, including revolutionary mortgage products. The widespread adoption of variable-rate mortgages and sophisticated debt instruments created unprecedented interconnections within the economy. This heightened exposure to real estate market fluctuations left both households and financial markets particularly vulnerable to market corrections.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually declined, institutions holding mortgage-backed securities faced severe consequences. Major investment banks collectively reported mortgage obligations exceeding $4.1 trillion by 2007, representing nearly one-third of America's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of several prestigious financial institutions, while government-sponsored enterprises, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, required federal intervention by late 2008.",
            "Let's discuss the pitfalls of exposition in storytelling. While it might seem tempting to unleash a torrent of background information, this approach often backfires spectacularly. Even experienced writers sometimes catch themselves drowning their readers in unnecessary details, prompting frustrated responses from their audience.\n\nRemember: exposition should be your servant, not your master.\n\nWriters frequently encounter the age-old advice to \"show, don't tell,\" yet many of us - myself included - occasionally fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs, or conversely, too much happens at once. It's like having two competing voices in your head: one urging you to quickly dispense with background information, the other insisting that every minute detail of every character's past must be shared.\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition delivers information directly to the audience. Consider how movies often handle this through dialogue between characters, with one person conveniently explaining everything to another. In written narratives, the author assumes this role.\n\nConsider this scenario: A story briefly mentions that two characters met, married, and tragically parted through death - all within a couple of pages and minimal dialogue. This approach does a disservice to the narrative. Instead, readers deserve to witness the husband's character through his actions and words, to understand why the heroine fell in love, and to feel the depth of their connection. This investment makes readers genuine participants in the heroine's grief, creating a deeper emotional resonance.\n\nThe difference lies between stating \"They met, married, and parted\" and crafting a living, breathing narrative.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to dump information, even when introducing new characters. Yes, that gas station night manager might be an ex-Air Force veteran with two marriages behind him who enjoys fishing and harbors dreams of ownership - but these details deserve to emerge naturally, not in one overwhelming burst.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable broadcasts on NBC 4. The morning programming began with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended an individual following an assault on his spouse involving multiple stab wounds. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nSubsequently, the broadcast covered an incident involving an 18-year-old shooting victim in the Sharon Woods district. The victim sustained critical injuries, and law enforcement, including SWAT personnel, were actively investigating with no suspects identified. The abbreviated coverage of this incident raised questions about potential media bias in crime reporting across different demographic groups.\n\nThe broadcast then addressed an aviation security concern involving a Med-Flight helicopter that sustained damage from what investigators determined to be a .22 caliber rifle round. Authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to an arrest.\n\nWeather coverage followed, highlighting anticipated precipitation and electrical storms for the weekend, with temperature forecasts remaining consistent in the 80-85°F range. This segment appeared deliberately concise to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe news team then reported on a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, providing detailed physical descriptions of the suspect. The emphasis placed on certain aspects of the suspect's appearance seemed disproportionate to the story's context.\n\nThe final segment covered a narcotics trafficking case involving an individual convicted of marijuana distribution between Texas and Ohio. The reporting included an unusual presentation of the sentence duration in months rather than years, and included demographic details that appeared superfluous to the core story.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with the trading flexibility of common stocks. These investment vehicles mirror specific indices, commodities, or asset groups while offering enhanced liquidity through exchange-based trading. Market participants can leverage ETF shares similarly to individual stocks, including options for short selling, margin trading, and fractional share purchases.\n\nThe financial advantages of ETFs extend beyond their operational flexibility. These instruments typically maintain significantly reduced expense ratios compared to conventional mutual funds, although investors should note that brokerage commissions apply to ETF transactions. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across various sectors and investment strategies.\n\nHowever, prudent investors should conduct thorough due diligence regarding marketed advantages such as portfolio diversification. This investigation focuses on analyzing the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF) in comparison to its principal components. The research aims to determine whether holding the ETF provides comparable benefits to maintaining discrete positions in its primary constituents, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns.\n\nMethodologically, this analysis concentrates on the fund's top ten holdings, which collectively represent 63.58% of total assets, as examining all components would prove impractical. To assess how effectively these primary positions reflect the complete fund's characteristics, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the corresponding portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns.\n\nThe computational results reveal intriguing disparities: a hypothetical portfolio comprising solely the top ten holdings demonstrates a return premium of 6.11% (representing a 16% performance differential) while maintaining a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. These preliminary findings suggest the potential superiority of a concentrated portfolio strategy. Nevertheless, further statistical analysis becomes necessary to determine whether these performance differentials maintain statistical significance.\n\nTo facilitate this statistical evaluation, we calculated and normalized the standard deviations for each component security to enable meaningful comparison with the aggregate fund's volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of the participation data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a concerning decline in commuter log entries during the project's third month. Multiple factors potentially contributed to this downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our northeastern institution naturally discouraged both cycling and pedestrian commuting. The academic calendar also played a significant role, as December brings final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties that consume the campus community's attention. Moreover, the extended winter break means many community members are absent from campus entirely.\n\nWhile these factors partially explain the December and January participation rates, the February numbers remain puzzling. One theory suggests that such initiatives often experience natural enthusiasm cycles, with initial excitement giving way to reduced engagement over time. Our response was to implement a focused \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, which successfully boosted participation rates. This experience highlighted two key operational challenges: maintaining momentum despite natural engagement cycles and adapting to academic calendar disruptions.\n\nThe project also confronted deeply ingrained cultural preferences for personal vehicle use, which offers unmatched convenience and autonomy. To counter this, we implemented an incentive structure featuring gift certificates to various local establishments, including dining venues, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating escalating prize values throughout the project timeline might have better sustained participation. For instance, introducing high-value rewards like premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles during later project phases could have prevented the observed engagement decline. While our initial incentives proved adequate for launch, a graduated reward system featuring increasingly substantial prizes might have better maintained community interest and participation levels throughout the project duration.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, specifically analyzing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces showcase innovative editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unique deviations in these early cinematic works.\n\nThe majority of these productions adhered to specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a theater-style presentation, maintained stationary camera positions, employed broader viewing angles, and typically contained just one continuous scene. However, some pioneering works from the early 1900s began challenging these established norms by incorporating multiple scenes.\n\nA striking characteristic shared among these productions was their theatrical staging. The camera remained fixed, similar to an audience member's perspective in a theater, never following the performers' movements. This approach clearly drew inspiration from stage performances, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts. This setup naturally constrained performer movement to lateral directions, as demonstrated in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors traverse the screen horizontally rather than approaching or retreating from the viewing perspective.\n\nThe theatrical influence extended to shot composition as well. Directors favored wide and occasional medium-range shots, completely avoiding close-ups throughout this period. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences simultaneously view the entire stage performance. The performers maintained their distance from the camera, preserving this theatrical perspective.\n\nThese productions typically consisted of what appeared to be single, continuous takes, usually running under sixty seconds. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, resulting in brief, vaudeville-style demonstrations focusing on magical effects rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that what viewers perceived as single shots often involved multiple cleverly merged segments. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate footage segments merge to create the illusion.",
            "Literary scholars often note that Gothic fiction represents a fascinating paradox: simultaneously embracing antiquity and modernity. This duality manifests in both its nomenclature and essence, as noted in Ian Watt's scholarly examination of the genre's emergence. Throughout its evolution, the Gothic literary movement has experienced dramatic shifts in critical reception, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nWhen Horace Walpole introduced The Castle of Otranto, widely acknowledged as the genre's cornerstone, he deliberately merged classical romantic elements with contemporary narrative techniques. His innovative approach, which he dubbed \"A Gothic Story,\" synthesized theatrical conventions from earlier periods with realistic character portrayals typical of contemporary fiction. The term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations, referring variously to historical periods, architectural styles, and cultural movements. During Walpole's era, many viewed gothic elements as primitive compared to contemporary literary developments. However, this unique fusion of theatrical gothic elements with novel-length psychological exploration has granted the genre remarkable staying power, allowing it to feel simultaneously historical and contemporary to readers across generations.\n\nThe medieval concept of chivalry emerges as a central theme in Gothic literature, particularly evident in The Castle of Otranto. This focus on chivalric ideals reflects contemporary anxieties about moral decay in society. Writing during politically turbulent times, Walpole appeared to view the medieval period as a moral golden age, contrasting sharply with what he perceived as the degradation of his era. This perspective manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. As a prince who has endured significant hardship and is believed to have fallen to infidels, Frederic exemplifies the archetypal \"gallant and courteous Knight\" - though his characterization ventures into hyperbole, establishing what would become a hallmark of Gothic excess.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept emerged in 1982, credited to consultant Keith Oliver, who articulated it as a comprehensive methodology for orchestrating and supervising supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements efficiently.\n\nAt its core, supply chain management rests on six fundamental pillars: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock control, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodologies for product creation. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the primary barometer of consumer demands. This market intelligence guides decisions about product selection and volume requirements. Subsequently, facility selection occurs, with emphasis on optimizing production capacity and quality standards while ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce manufacturing sites are determined, attention shifts to workflow coordination and equipment upkeep. The manufacturing phase demands meticulous attention to detail, as oversights can result in significant financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nResource procurement, the second pillar, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Organizations often maintain multiple production units for single items, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize process allocation across these units or potentially engage external partners. The primary motivation for outsourcing stems from the pursuit of velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while achieving or preserving cost efficiency.",
            "Literature from the Victorian era typically showcases meticulous descriptive elements and predominantly centers on upper-class society. However, two notable exceptions to this pattern emerge in the form of \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These works diverge from conventional Victorian literature by incorporating mysterious elements and unusual narrative approaches, which serve to enhance character development and provide deeper insights into their psychological states and emotional motivations.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth narratives employ dream sequences and hallucinatory states, though each serves distinct purposes. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these surreal episodes illuminate the protagonist's internal struggles and his growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this effectively. Through a dreamlike recollection, Oliver experiences the trauma anew, highlighting his powerlessness in the face of events beyond his control. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore both his physical deterioration and psychological torment. The scene's sensory confusion - where pain becomes a constant rather than an acute sensation - emphasizes his disorientation and vulnerability. This portrayal raises questions about agency and fate, suggesting Oliver's increasing resignation to his circumstances, possibly indicating Fagin's successful manipulation of his spirit. His lack of self-preservation instinct during this critical moment implies a deepening surrender to despair.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my tenure as an elementary school tutor, I encountered a memorable case that highlighted a significant educational challenge. The student, Adrian, appeared to be a native English speaker despite his Hispanic background, yet he demonstrated unusual difficulties with reading. His letter recognition pattern was inconsistent - some perfectly clear, others completely foreign to him.\n\nThe breakthrough came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's primary exposure to written language had been through Spanish alphabet conventions. While verbally fluent in English, he struggled with the fundamentals of English orthography.\n\nThis experience illuminates a broader issue within our educational system, particularly in California's diverse linguistic landscape. The challenge extends beyond obvious language barriers - even students who appear fully assimilated may face hidden obstacles in literacy acquisition. The solution requires a multi-faceted approach combining various methodologies: dual-language instruction, immersion programs, individualized tutoring, and structured ESL support.\n\nResearch demonstrates that dual-language education yields superior academic outcomes across all student populations. Despite concerns about resource allocation, implementing comprehensive bilingual programs benefits both native English speakers and language learners. While universal teacher bilingualism remains impractical, incorporating specialized bilingual support staff offers a viable solution for creating inclusive learning environments.",
            "Throughout human history, people have grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. Different cultures address this through various institutions: churches, synagogues, or personal meditation. While many individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions without question, others staunchly reject any notion of supernatural forces, choosing instead to view existence through a purely individualistic lens. Our spiritual journeys often evolve, with beliefs shifting and transforming as we mature. Each person's quest for meaning represents a unique expedition through life's mysteries, as we all seek illumination amid life's uncertainties.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I shared a quiet moment with my father on our home's veranda. \"Cardinals are my favorite,\" he responded when I inquired about birds. The rainfall created a rhythmic symphony against the metal roofing while we shared a smoke. Overflowing gutters drenched the garden below. His gaze wandered distantly across the landscape, his frame noticeably diminished from illness. His once-full head of hair had thinned considerably. Words about our impending separation remained unspoken, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, I simply moved closer, and together we observed the summer shower as dusk approached.\n\nThat winter, shortly after I turned twenty-two, my father succumbed to his illness. Despite aggressive medical interventions extending his life beyond predictions, I questioned their purpose given his prolonged suffering. My faith wavered; the concept of a benevolent deity seemed impossible in the face of such cruelty. During sleepless nights, prayer felt futile - as if any divine presence had long since abandoned me.\n\nI made a conscious choice to avoid witnessing his final moments. As his only offspring, I understood him profoundly enough to know he wouldn't want me present for that culminating scene. I preferred preserving memories of his vitality rather than his decline. Isolated in my bedroom, I spent three days awaiting inevitable news.\n\nThe notification never came through any phone call.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideals, the agriculturalist and political figure John Taylor of Caroline stands prominent. His agricultural background, combined with his political endeavors, shaped him into a passionate defender of individual liberties and limited governance. Agricultural principles fundamentally influenced his perspectives on governmental matters, from constitutional interpretation to judicial philosophy, as he sought to protect what he viewed as humanity's noblest profession.\n\nTaylor recognized America's unique position to establish an unprecedented governmental framework, unfettered by historical precedents. He emphasized the interconnected nature of fundamental human rights, arguing that these liberties formed an inseparable whole - compromise one, and the entire structure would eventually collapse. In his view, civilization must transcend the primitive \"state of nature\" where physical strength and cunning dominated, instead establishing protections for all citizens.\n\nThe establishment of an effective society, Taylor maintained, required governmental structures acknowledging humanity's moral complexity. His framework recognized both virtuous and corrupt human tendencies, asserting that \"governmental characteristics mirror human nature.\" He championed policies protecting private property and agricultural development while opposing capitalistic excess. Taylor acknowledged self-interest as a universal human motivator but distinguished between its constructive and destructive manifestations.\n\nRegarding constitutional matters, Taylor aligned with contemporary Republican thought, advocating strict constitutional interpretation. He favored severely limited federal authority, restricting it to explicitly granted powers. While supporting literal constitutional reading, he emphasized the importance of understanding the founders' original intent. Notably, Taylor elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more explicit affirmation of state sovereignty over national unity.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, taking in the scene before me with clinical detachment. Like a scientist observing a specimen, I processed the visual information without emotional investment, my thoughts flowing like water through a sieve – present one moment, gone the next.\n\nI recalled a time when I had pursued artistic endeavors. Following a colleague's suggestion, I had invested in Betty Edwards' renowned instructional text on drawing. The book's methodology included a fascinating technique of frame isolation – reducing complex scenes to manageable segments for artistic interpretation. This approach transformed overwhelming panoramas into digestible visual elements.\n\nBut in this moment, no artistic framework could contain what lay before me. The sight commanded my full attention, demanding acknowledgment in its raw authenticity. While the great masters had their signature palettes – Picasso's blues, Monet's verdant landscapes – here was my own peculiar canvas, a monochromatic study in earthen hues.\n\nI reached for my tool with practiced precision, my movements deliberate and measured. The porcelain throne before me held its unwanted offering, resistant to the rushing waters I summoned. Each pull of the handle sent crystalline streams swirling, yet the stubborn mass remained unmoved, anchored like barnacles to a ship's hull.\n\nThere I stood in my retail uniform, complete with regulation green necktie, contemplating this unexpected challenge in the Rite Aid restroom. After several unsuccessful attempts at hydraulic persuasion, I resorted to more direct measures. Methodically wrapping my hand in protective layers of tissue, I steeled myself for the task ahead. With the determination of someone reaching into an oven to retrieve a well-done roast, I extended my hand toward the bowl's depths...",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among adolescent drivers demands our immediate attention. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates that neurological development in adolescents remains insufficient for handling the complexities of operating motor vehicles. The combination of underdeveloped decision-making capabilities and limited driving experience creates a perfect storm of risk factors.\n\nStudies conducted by various research organizations highlight a disturbing correlation between passenger age demographics and collision frequency. This data becomes particularly relevant when considering the social patterns of young drivers, who frequently transport their peers.\n\nWhile various jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing programs to mitigate these risks, such measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem persists: physiologically and psychologically, young drivers consistently demonstrate inadequate capacity for managing automotive responsibilities.\n\nDistinguished psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research, as reported in USA Today, indicates that risk-seeking behavior peaks during late adolescence, suggesting that even 18-year-olds may lack the maturity necessary for safe driving. This propensity for thrill-seeking, combined with the projected surge in eligible young drivers as children of Baby Boomers reach driving age, portends a potentially catastrophic increase in roadway fatalities.\n\nA practical solution exists through comprehensive federal legislation. Educational institutions could maintain their driver education programs, but actual licensure would be restricted to individuals 18 and older. The existing framework of provisional permits and supervised training requirements could remain intact, utilizing current state-mandated guidelines for practical experience. For instance, jurisdictions like California already mandate specific training requirements: 6 hours of professional instruction plus 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven that mortality statistics among young drivers remain consistent across state lines, implementing uniform national standards represents a logical approach to addressing this critical public safety concern. This proposed regulatory framework builds upon existing precedents rather than introducing radical changes.",
            "An Overview of Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nThe following discussion examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) through three distinct lenses: its fundamental definition, diagnostic procedures, and classroom accommodations for affected students.\n\nCAPD, alternatively known as APD, represents a unique neurological condition affecting auditory information processing. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's 2005 guidelines, this disorder impacts how effectively the brain processes acoustic signals. Interestingly, individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing capabilities but struggle with the brain's interpretation of auditory input, such as distinguishing specific voices amid background noise or processing verbal communications effectively.\n\nThe historical trajectory of CAPD research began during the 1950s, when scientists initially labeled the condition \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking developments emerged through Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari's pioneering assessment methods in 1954. Subsequently, Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961 revolutionized our understanding of auditory processing pathways. A pivotal 1977 conference catalyzed extensive research initiatives focusing on pediatric CAPD cases.\n\nCAPD's symptom profile encompasses various challenges: spatial sound orientation difficulties, problems distinguishing between concurrent sounds, pattern recognition deficits, inability to detect vocal nuances (including emotional undertones), auditory masking issues, difficulties synthesizing acoustic information, and challenges with sequential auditory processing.\n\nDiagnostic procedures typically involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by multidisciplinary teams, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments incorporate behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory testing protocols. Currently, no singular diagnostic tool definitively identifies CAPD, and its etiology remains unclear. Contemporary evaluation methods often utilize dichotic listening tasks and sophisticated acoustic response measurements to assess auditory processing capabilities.",
            "My aspiration to join the Division of Family and Children Services stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for vulnerable youth and support families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with personal challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping mechanisms. These observations guided me toward completing my Psychology degree at Piedmont College in 2009. Following graduation, I took time to reflect on my career direction. A pivotal moment occurred when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse at a friend's home. The subsequent day brought news of police involvement at his family residence. Drawing upon my psychology background, I offered assistance at the scene. When law enforcement requested my help in communicating with the parents, their defensive responses and dismissive attitude toward serious family conflicts solidified my resolve to pursue social work.\n\nThe principle of social justice particularly resonates with my worldview. Contemporary society presents a paradox: while claiming to value individuality, it often promotes conformity. My personal journey reflects a consistent challenge to societal norms and prejudices. Throughout my academic career, I actively demonstrated my commitment to social justice through various forms of self-expression and advocacy. This included supporting LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA participation, confronting racial discrimination, and expressing individuality through personal appearance choices. My dedication to promoting social justice remains unwavering and will continue to inform my professional practice.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through two distinct frameworks: the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives. While biological approaches emphasize hereditary factors and physiological mechanisms, sociocultural analyses concentrate on environmental influences, including demographic variables and cultural contexts. This examination delves into both paradigms, presenting relevant research and evaluating their respective merits and limitations.\n\nSleep disturbances manifest in various categories: they may exist independently, emerge alongside other psychological conditions, or stem from external factors. Independent sleep disorders encompass two main groups: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The former includes conditions like Primary Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and several others, while Parasomnias encompass disorders such as night terrors and sleepwalking. When these disturbances coincide with other psychological conditions, they're typically associated with either Clinical or Personality Disorders.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, research has illuminated fascinating neurological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Scientists have identified crucial neurons within the hypothalamus that contain orexin, which plays a vital role in sleep-wake cycles. Recent studies involving laboratory mice have revealed that GABAB receptors on these neurons significantly influence sleep patterns. When researchers activated specific receptors using baclofen (a GABAB agonist), they observed increased sleep duration. These findings suggest potential therapeutic approaches for sleep disorders, though more research is needed to fully understand their implications for human subjects. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, potentially affecting their academic performance, professional life, and overall well-being.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've gained considerable insight into the transportation challenges that plague our expanding campus. During my initial year, my residence in Stuart Hall, situated in East Halls, positioned me at what felt like the campus periphery. The journey to central locations like Willard Building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nAn interesting conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast empty spaces. Today, those areas have transformed into athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, plus numerous residential developments. This expansion, while beneficial for the university's growth, has intensified transportation difficulties.\n\nIn contemplating solutions to this mobility challenge, one option stands paramount: cycling. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after abandoning it for several years. Their enthusiasm was palpable as they declared cycling's superiority for campus navigation, despite its temporary decline in popularity. Beyond its health advantages, cycling represents the most energy-efficient transportation method available - a simple breakfast can fuel considerable distance.\n\nNow residing off-campus at a distance comparable to some university housing, I've discovered that cycling has revolutionized my daily routine. The trek to Thomas Building, typically requiring 25 minutes by foot, now takes merely 5 minutes with vigorous pedaling. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking maintains its merits, my packed schedule necessitates faster transportation. The time savings are substantial - cycling eliminates roughly 150 minutes of walking weekly, considering just one daily class commute. Factor in additional campus movements, and the temporal benefits become even more significant.",
            "In his masterwork Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a disturbing future society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes personal autonomy, and the pursuit of pleasure has become life's primary directive. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere components in an elaborate social machine.\n\nA close reading through Marxist interpretation reveals profound commentary on societal control mechanisms. The text demonstrates multiple parallels with Marxist concepts, particularly regarding social homogenization and the transformation of human experience into commodity. These elements suggest Huxley's deep-seated concerns about the direction of modern economic systems.\n\nThe novel's society exemplifies what Marx termed \"false consciousness,\" where populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. This manifests clearly in the rigid caste system, where lower classes (Deltas, Gammas) are programmed through sleep-learning to embrace consumerist behaviors and their predetermined social roles. The World Controller orchestrates this grand deception, wielding complete authority over the populace's thoughts and desires.\n\nSocial interactions in this society lack genuine emotional depth. Characters appear as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals, suggesting the dehumanizing effects of technological determinism and market forces. Meaningful connections are absent; instead, relationships remain shallow, with men viewing women primarily as objects of pleasure (\"pneumatic\"), while women discuss intimate encounters with clinical detachment. Each social stratum's acceptance of their position reflects Marx's observations about how capitalism maintains control through false consciousness, with individuals believing in their own fulfillment while serving merely as cogs in the consumer machine.\n\nThe class structure's rigid maintenance through psychological conditioning demonstrates how power systems perpetuate themselves by creating willing participants in their own subjugation. The lower classes remain blissfully unaware of their manipulation, while most upper-class citizens (Alphas and Betas) choose comfortable compliance over questioning the status quo.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that sparked an ongoing intellectual curiosity about religious tolerance in contemporary society. The discourse surrounding Islam, particularly in the post-9/11 era, has undergone a remarkable transformation. We've witnessed a pendulum swing from initial skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic presidency of Barack Obama, whose family heritage includes Islamic influences.\n\nThe historical accounts of Muhammad's life present fascinating contradictions that warrant scholarly examination. Traditional narratives often portray him as a military strategist who expanded his influence through conquest, yet biographical sources paint a markedly different picture - one of a misunderstood spiritual leader whose followers gathered voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nWhat strikes me as particularly noteworthy are the parallels between Islamic and Christian religious narratives. Consider, for instance, the account of Muhammad multiplying food for forty individuals, which bears striking resemblance to Christian miracle accounts. These similarities raise important questions about the transmission and adaptation of religious narratives across cultural boundaries, and perhaps suggest an attempt to establish legitimacy through familiar motifs.\n\nThe biographical sources rely heavily on chains of oral transmission, a common practice in ancient historical documentation. While this methodology aimed to establish credibility through multiple attestation, modern historical criticism might question the reliability of such extensively mediated accounts.\n\nThe disparity between historical records and religious biographical accounts creates a challenging dichotomy. While religious texts present Muhammad as an exemplar of humility and wisdom, historical evidence suggests a more complex figure who wielded considerable political and military authority. This raises important questions about historical accuracy versus religious interpretation in sacred biographical literature.",
            "Historical analysis reveals that the original message of Christ became increasingly diluted as Christian theology evolved post-crucifixion. Examining this progression chronologically demonstrates an expanding divergence from initial principles. Contemporary society exhibits mounting intellectual curiosity and unprecedented liberal inclinations, though conservative elements persist in maintaining traditional interpretations. These traditionalists, while vocal, may lack sufficient numbers to shape broader societal directions.\n\nFuture decades will likely witness an expanding historical consciousness among Christian adherents, accompanied by an intensifying desire to separate subsequent theological additions from Jesus's fundamental teachings. This transformation, though potentially spanning generations or centuries, appears inevitable: Christian theology will undergo a remarkable reversal, gradually shedding accumulated doctrinal layers until reaching its foundational essence - Christ's original divine message.\n\nAs this movement gains momentum across Western nations, inspiring multitudes to embrace first-century worship practices, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their leadership role. Paradoxically, this theological retrospection will likely reduce denominational fragmentation, fostering increased uniformity in belief systems and religious practices. Historical precedent supports such dramatic reversals - consider Rome's transformation from Christian persecutor to Christian empire, or America's evolution from slave-holding nation to one embracing diverse leadership.\n\nThis impending theological reformation will largely depend upon interpreting Christ's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. But to comprehend this progression, we must examine Christianity's roots in Judaism. Prior to Rome's occupation of Jerusalem (63 BCE), Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority. Yet even then, Jewish society exhibited internal divisions among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through my analysis of The Jungle, it becomes evident that humanity's inherent nature tends toward self-interest and avarice. The narrative demonstrates how individuals prioritize their personal advancement while disregarding those beneath them in social standing. This theme manifests particularly strongly in Sinclair's portrayal of industrial leadership.\n\nThe corporate executives and facility administrators exemplify this behavior through their relentless pursuit of expansion and profit. Their actions demonstrate complete indifference to collateral damage, whether environmental or human. As Sinclair illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery powerfully conveys the environmental devastation wrought by industrial negligence. The administration's apathy extends to the toxic emissions from their facilities and the biological waste from countless animal enclosures surrounding Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation extends deeply into labor practices. As one passage notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers faced arbitrary dismissal, hazardous conditions, and excessive hours without recourse. The absence of regulatory oversight during this period enabled widespread abuse. While not explicitly stated, residents of Packingtown were expected to endure both occupational and environmental hazards without complaint. Support systems were notably absent, and even labor unions often exploited rather than protected workers. Sinclair draws a powerful parallel to slavery, noting that \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Among the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, \"Dream-land\" stands as a notable composition that the author himself held in high regard. The poem contains references to \"Thulé,\" appearing at both its beginning and end. While scholars traditionally connect this term to Virgil's description of a mysterious northern island beyond Britain's shores, contemporary research suggests an alternative inspiration.\n\nThe German literary sphere, particularly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's contributions, offers compelling connections. A fascinating parallel emerges between Poe's work and Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust,\" completed in two segments (1808 and 1832). Within \"Faust Part Two\" lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poignant narrative about a bereaved monarch who, after receiving a goblet from his dying queen, succumbs to grief and alcohol before a dramatic seaside death.\n\nThe thematic resonance between these works is striking. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" explore themes of isolation, loss, and darkness. Poe's narrator traverses a colorless realm populated by spectral memories, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's king. This parallel becomes more significant considering Poe's documented appreciation for German literature and his connection to Tennyson, another Goethe admirer.\n\nThe timing is also noteworthy - H.P. Grattan's 1842 adaptation of \"Faust\" preceded Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by mere months. This temporal proximity, combined with the works' shared motifs, suggests more than coincidental similarity. The evidence points to a deliberate artistic dialogue between these literary pieces, with Poe potentially crafting \"Dream-Land\" as a dark reflection of Goethe's earlier work.",
            "Would California law permit punitive damages in a case where a grocery store patron sustained injuries from slipping on spilled applesauce, given that the store manager deliberately ignored two staff notifications about the hazard while taking his meal break?\n\nAnalysis indicates the court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed. California statutes permit such damages when defendants exhibit \"oppression, fraud or malice\" in non-contractual matters (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294). The circumstances suggest potential malicious conduct, defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" behavior showing conscious disregard for safety.\n\nThe incident occurred at approximately 5:30 PM when Jennifer Palmer encountered the unremediated spill. Documentation shows that two staff members - R. Wayne and M. Haddigan - had separately notified Manager Paul Martin about the hazard at 5:00 PM and 5:15 PM respectively. Martin dismissed both reports, citing his dinner break as justification for inaction.\n\nSeveral factors strengthen the punitive damages argument:\n- The store's history of six similar incidents in 2009 alone\n- Martin's repeated refusal to address a known safety hazard\n- His explicit prioritization of a meal break over customer safety\n- The reasonable foreseeability of injury given past incidents\n\nWhile establishing \"despicable\" conduct presents a higher bar, Martin's pattern of negligence despite multiple prior accidents could satisfy this requirement. The manager's documented responses to staff warnings demonstrate conscious disregard for patron safety, potentially meeting the \"willful and deliberate failure\" standard outlined in Taylor v. Superior Court (1979).\n\nGiven these circumstances, summary dismissal of punitive damages would be inappropriate as sufficient evidence exists to support the claim's key elements under California law.",
            "Throughout her adolescence, an inexplicable yearning persisted within her consciousness. This peculiar sensation first manifested around her fourteenth year and maintained its presence well into her seventeenth. Eventually, the abstract longing crystallized into something more specific - a desire for companionship. Curiously, despite numerous advances from potential suitors, she remained unmoved by their attempts at courtship. This puzzling emotional state became a frequent subject of her introspection, though years of contemplation yielded no satisfactory explanations.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere of her household typically exuded tranquility. Her parents, both even-tempered individuals, rarely engaged in disputes, either with each other or their vivacious daughter. The sole source of tension arose from her assertions of autonomy. Despite inheriting their gentle nature, she possessed an effervescent personality that drew others to her naturally.\n\nHowever, this particular afternoon shattered their usual serenity. While wandering between rooms seeking creative inspiration, she detected an alarming cry emanating from the kitchen - her mother's voice distorted by pain. Rushing to investigate, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, each breath punctuated by expressions of agony. \"Hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths, directing her daughter's hands to assist. Years of physical conditioning proved invaluable as she carefully transported her injured mother to their vehicle.\n\nThe clinical environment of the emergency room, with its characteristic antiseptic atmosphere, barely registered in her consciousness as she focused solely on securing medical attention. After calling for assistance, she watched helplessly as healthcare professionals whisked her mother away on a gurney, leaving her alone with her concerns.\n\nThe incident's cause was surprisingly mundane - an unfortunate fall from a stepstool while attempting to retrieve a decorative vessel from an elevated storage space.",
            "Recent research has investigated the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns resembling those of Mediterranean coastal regions. The investigation centered on evaluating whether individuals following an adapted Mediterranean eating pattern, quantified through the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) scoring system, experienced reduced instances of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart disease and stroke-related events.\n\nThe adapted Mediterranean eating pattern emphasizes abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grain products, and protein-rich plant sources. It also promotes the use of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats over saturated alternatives, includes regular fish consumption, and permits moderate alcohol consumption while limiting animal-based products.\n\nEarlier research had demonstrated promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating patterns and decreased overall mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes. Additionally, controlled studies indicated superior outcomes in weight management and cholesterol profiles compared to traditional low-fat dietary approaches among overweight participants. However, specific impacts on stroke occurrence remained unexplored.\n\nThe research team tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals, aged 38-63, participating in the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study across 11 American states. None had pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or diabetes at enrollment. Dietary habits were assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered six times between 1984 and 2004, maintaining an exceptional 95% participant retention rate. Health outcomes were verified through medical documentation, with some cases (17% of strokes, 24% of non-fatal heart attacks) classified as probable when complete records were unavailable.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of dietary scores and incorporated adjustments for various health-related behaviors and characteristics. Statistical analysis employed Cox proportional-hazard models to evaluate relationships between dietary adherence and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant cardiovascular benefits among participants maintaining higher aMed scores. Throughout the two-decade observation period, researchers documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related fatalities. Statistical analysis showed that participants achieving the highest dietary scores demonstrated a 29% lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A solitary figure emerges from the urban landscape - actress Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, displays a provocative message on cardboard: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has endured decades of military rule since a 1962 military takeover. In 2007, the country witnessed unprecedented demonstrations, primarily led by Buddhist clergy members wearing their distinctive saffron-colored robes. What began as peaceful assemblies quickly devolved into widespread conflict between religious institutions and government forces. International media faced severe restrictions, culminating in the tragic death of Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photographer, during a demonstration. While official statistics cite merely 13 casualties, a military defector named Colonel Hla Win suggested the actual death count reached thousands.\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout human history. Ancient civilizations often justified authoritarian control through divine mandate - from Roman emperors claiming celestial approval to Japanese monarchs being revered as deities themselves. Modern governance continues to display concerning relationships between political and religious institutions, as exemplified by the interactions between President George W. Bush and religious leader Ted Haggard.\n\nHistorical precedents demonstrate the devastating impact of authoritarian control. The 1989 Tiananmen Square incident resulted in significant casualties, with estimates varying dramatically between government figures (200-300) and Chinese Red Cross reports (2,000-3,000). Similarly, the 1990s Rwandan crisis saw systematic elimination of Tutsi civilians and moderate politicians by Hutu militias with government support. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany's regime represents another instance of state-sponsored persecution, targeting Jewish populations across multiple nations.",
            "The remarkable influence of Duke Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his enduring career and exceptional talent for orchestral composition. While his piano work remains understated in many pieces, his brilliance shines through his ability to craft intricate compositions that brought out the best in each musician. By establishing frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with improvisational freedom, Ellington demonstrated an uncanny ability to harness the unique qualities of individual performers while maintaining cohesive ensemble sound.\n\nThe musical encyclopedia Grove highlights Creole Love Call as a prime example of Ellington's innovative approach to incorporating vocals as instrumental elements. This twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six distinct choruses, each showcasing different aspects of his orchestration mastery:\n\nInitially, vocals and reeds engage in dialogue, transitioning from smooth to coarse tones. A muted trumpet then takes center stage, expanding upon the core melody with extended blue notes. The third chorus features soaring clarinet work accompanied by delicate piano syncopation. The fourth movement brings the full ensemble into play, with brass and reeds echoing the opening dialogue. The piece reaches its peak in the fifth chorus through high-register reed work against punctuated brass and rhythm. The final chorus mirrors the opening structure before concluding with a brief coda featuring vocal flourishes and unconventional trombone resolution.\n\nThis innovative vocal integration appears throughout Ellington's repertoire, as evidenced in Hot and Bothered, where \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet converses with Baby Cox's scatting, creating an intriguing blend of instrumental and vocal timbres. Similarly, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's distinctive muted trombone introduction, further demonstrating Ellington's gift for leveraging individual talents within his compositions.",
            "What mechanisms drive evolutionary pathways in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the factors that channel evolutionary trajectories, yet our ability to describe biological forms mathematically remains limited - a challenge first noted by D'Arcy Thompson over a century ago. Recent advances have enabled researchers to apply mathematical frameworks to analyze shell formation in mollusks, both during individual development and across evolutionary time scales.\n\nOur research focuses on the genus Prunum, where we combine mathematical modeling with experimental approaches to investigate evolutionary-developmental patterns. By analyzing X-ray images of various Prunum species, we extracted quantitative measurements that were input into CerioShell software to generate both theoretical and actual shell configurations. This allowed us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological variations within this group. We are integrating these computational results with laboratory observations to better comprehend large-scale evolutionary transitions in these organisms.\n\nThe architecture of mollusk shells follows fascinating geometric principles. Each shell essentially consists of a tubular structure that coils through space, completing 360-degree rotations. These rotational segments, termed whorls, wrap around a central columella. The growth pattern varies in expansion rate, with adjacent whorls separated by a linear depression called a suture. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically achieves the largest diameter. Above it lies the spire, encompassing all previous whorls, which terminates in the apex. The base occupies the opposite end, featuring the aperture - the opening through which the animal emerges.\n\nShell orientation can be described from multiple perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard presentation shows the shell in apertural view, with the opening facing the observer and apex directed upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a standardized protocol. Beginning with an apical view, one identifies the initial suture point and draws a reference line across the shell. Counting proceeds from this line, with measurements precise to quarter-whorl increments.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a series of successive apertures moving through four-dimensional space as the organism constructs its shell. This progression can be mapped using coordinates that track aperture centers and dimensional measurements. Such data enable both graphical and mathematical representations, allowing researchers to model variations in shell formation processes.",
            "Recent data indicates that Indonesia's progress in reducing newborn and infant death rates has stagnated during the previous decade. Despite achieving success in various Millennium Development Goals, particularly regarding water access and sanitation improvements, progress in both child and maternal healthcare falls significantly behind schedule for meeting 2015 objectives. Several factors contribute to these challenges, suggesting that broad healthcare infrastructure enhancement might prove more beneficial than isolated program-specific solutions.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has achieved a 72% rate of professionally-attended births, this statistic requires careful interpretation. Many of these attendants include traditional birthing assistants who lack medical expertise for managing complications, particularly in cases of severe bleeding, which remains a leading cause of maternal fatality. Furthermore, professional medical treatment for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions has decreased. Available information about post-birth care, though limited, suggests widespread inadequacies throughout the nation.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% nationwide. A stark urban-rural divide exists, with cities reporting 7% cesarean rates compared to just 2% in rural regions. This disparity highlights significant healthcare accessibility issues across different geographical areas. Economic disparities further compound these challenges, with a 27% difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies for enhancement, policymakers face a crucial decision between targeted programmatic interventions and comprehensive healthcare system strengthening. While specialized initiatives offer clear objectives and quick results, they present notable disadvantages. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other critical healthcare areas and create inefficient parallel systems with redundant administrative burdens. The HIV/AIDS funding impact on family planning services exemplifies these unintended consequences.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing numerous genres that defy simple categorization. Each primary musical style - whether it's jazz, rap, rock, folk, or country - has branched into countless subdivisions, creating an intricate web of musical expression. Among these, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly noteworthy, having evolved into an extraordinarily complex and emotionally charged genre since its emergence four decades ago.\n\nHeavy Metal's emotional palette, while predominantly exploring darker themes, demonstrates remarkable range. Its evolution has been organic and continuous, with musicians consistently pushing boundaries and establishing new subgenres. This process of musical innovation persists to this day, resulting in an ever-expanding universe of metal variations.\n\nThe contemporary metal landscape is so varied that defining its core characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has absorbed influences from numerous other musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To truly comprehend modern metal's diverse manifestations, one must examine it not merely as a genre, but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nMetal's essence lies in its intensity and complexity. It demands technical excellence from its practitioners and embraces extremes - in volume, instrumental prowess, theatrical presentation, and emotional expression. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic revolution of the 1970s, when musicians, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal distinguished itself by embracing darker themes at a time when mainstream music typically avoided such territory. Modern metal often draws inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic Era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles - widely regarded as one of heavy metal's precursors. Created as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcased the band's ability to produce darker, more intense music. Its inclusion on The White Album marked a significant moment in metal's early development, demonstrating its cyclical, drug-influenced themes.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, encompasses multiple layers of significance - it portrays both a female subject experiencing an enchanted landscape and symbolizes the artist's personal aspirations. Throughout his career, Rousseau yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental artistic challenge: whether to embrace established artistic conventions or pursue his unique creative direction.\n\nUnderstanding Rousseau's background provides essential context for interpreting The Dream. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, he came from a middle-class background, with his father working as a prosperous hardware merchant. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau lacked formal artistic training and spent his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - he lost eight children in infancy and his first wife, Clémence, leaving him with a single daughter, Julia. Art became his sanctuary and source of renewal during these difficult times. His artistic perspective reflected his working-class origins, contrasting sharply with the romanticized depictions of peasant life common among his peers.\n\nThe timing of Rousseau's artistic pursuit coincided with an era of exceptional artistic innovation, making his quest for recognition particularly challenging. Despite years of dedication, widespread appreciation for his work emerged only when artists like Matisse were gaining prominence. Art historian Jan Gordon draws an interesting comparison between these two figures, noting their contrasting motivations: while Matisse actively sought to avoid conventional artistic expression, Rousseau paradoxically aspired to create work conventional enough to gain acceptance from the established artistic community.",
            "The relationship between moral principles and artistic expression has long fascinated scholars and philosophers. This connection runs deeper than mere coincidence. While Keats famously equated truth with beauty in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" the significance of this parallel extends beyond poetic metaphor. Unlike traditional knowledge acquisition through formal education or lived experiences, our understanding of both moral principles and artistic merit seems to emerge from a more intuitive source. These fields focus primarily on analytical observation rather than prescriptive rules - we examine why certain artworks resonate or why specific actions feel ethically sound, instead of establishing rigid guidelines for creating art or determining moral behavior.\n\nInterestingly, neither artistic criticism nor ethical analysis can fully encompass the essence of their subjects. Consider discussions about masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - while experts may analyze technical elements such as composition and historical context, these aspects alone cannot explain its enduring impact. People often preface their appreciation of art with phrases like \"There's something special about it\" before delving into technical analysis. This ineffable quality exists in both artistic appreciation and moral understanding. As noted by O'Connor, narrative storytelling often communicates what direct statements cannot, suggesting that both art and ethics possess elements that transcend conventional description.\n\nThe profound connection between morality and artistic expression may stem from their shared appeal to our intuitive understanding. This link becomes particularly evident in literature, where moral considerations naturally intertwine with artistic expression. Literature holds special significance because it inherently deals with human values and ethical choices, making it uniquely positioned to explore moral dimensions in ways that other art forms might not. The value systems we encounter in literature mirror those we grapple with in real life, creating a natural bridge between artistic expression and ethical contemplation.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerhouse nation, its unified territories stretching from Munich's alpine foothills to Kiel's maritime shores along the Baltic. A common thread of identity weaves through the western city of Cologne along the Rhine, across the heartland, and reaches the historic Dresden nestled by the Elbe River. This cohesive nation-state, however, emerged from a complex tapestry of diverse peoples and ancestral groups.\n\nThe land known historically as Germania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of this designation remains contentious among academics. Historical records from Tacitus suggest the term originated with the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. The term \"Germanus\" first appeared in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, borrowed from Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Linguistic scholars propose various origins: some point to ancient Gallic words for \"neighbor,\" others to the Germanic \"ger\" spear, while certain experts connect it to Old Irish \"garim,\" suggesting a reference to vocal characteristics.\n\nHistorical documentation from 98 CE, specifically Tacitus's \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" presents the Germanic peoples as indigenous inhabitants, suggesting minimal external influence through migration or cultural exchange. Tacitus emphasized the region's forbidding nature, questioning why anyone would choose such harsh terrain over Mediterranean comforts unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nRoman interaction with Germania remained primarily commercial and military in nature. While the Empire conducted periodic campaigns into Germanic territories, permanent settlement proved rare. Germanic tribes, emerging prominently during the first century, maintained a complex relationship with Rome, engaging in trade and occasionally serving in Roman military units while preserving their independence along the Empire's frontiers.",
            "Shakespeare's masterpiece Twelfth Night explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The ultimate dilemma emerges when one must choose between maintaining their true identity and preserving social bonds, as revelations of deceit often strain relationships beyond repair.\n\nThe narrative particularly scrutinizes gender-based deception, raising fundamental questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine attire represents a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, yet this choice isolates her from feminine companionship.\n\nThis calculated deception produces unforeseen complications. Viola's convincing male persona captivates Olivia, leading to a case of mistaken identity with her brother Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Additionally, her disguise complicates her growing attachment to Orsino, who laments: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nContemporary interpretations might view the play as an examination of how artifice can unveil latent desires, particularly regarding Olivia and Orsino's reactions. Their responses to Viola/Cesario potentially suggest unexplored aspects of their own identities. However, Shakespeare likely intended Olivia's character as a satirical commentary on superficial attraction rather than an exploration of sexual fluidity. This interpretation gains credence through her seamless transfer of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola in a familial context: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The historical record shows varying perspectives on colonial administration across different territories. While instances of severe mistreatment occurred, particularly in German South West Africa against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples, the broader picture reveals a complex tapestry of administrative approaches. Educational initiatives, for instance, demonstrated remarkable variation across regions under German authority.\n\nPost-World War I assessments by British administrators in former German East Africa (Tanganyika) revealed an unexpected discovery: a substantial population of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar positive reports emerged regarding educational achievements in Kamerun and other territories. However, the narrative shifts dramatically when examining South West Africa, known today as Namibia.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational framework established in East Africa, South West African educational development relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal governmental assistance. Conversely, European residents benefited from substantial educational investment, including state-funded schools and enhanced support for religious educational institutions. These disparate approaches created lasting implications. While other territories produced numerous educated indigenous populations, South West Africa's native inhabitants largely remained without access to formal education.\n\nRecent scholarship has explored the underlying causes of this educational disparity, particularly examining newly available evidence regarding settler attitudes and administrative policies. The academic literature, predominantly German-language sources from the early 1900s, initially focused on descriptive accounts of colonial educational systems. Subsequent English-language research has provided comparative analyses and deeper exploration of specific educational aspects across different territories.\n\nCohen's influential research comparing South West African and East African education suggests that demographic factors, particularly the size of the European settler population, significantly influenced educational policy development. South West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its substantial desert regions, attracted a larger European presence. By 1913, the territory hosted nearly 15,000 European settlers, almost triple the number in East Africa, its closest competitor in terms of settler population.",
            "During the mid-19th century, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that persisted for nearly six decades, spanning from 1836 to 1893. This period of strained relations culminated in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in Mexico's defeat and the subsequent American acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Numerous confrontations continued until the early 1900s, with conflicts rooted in fundamental differences regarding faith, societal values, and economic interests.\n\nSuch neighboring-state conflicts are not uncommon in global history. Countries sharing geographical boundaries frequently encounter competing interests that foster antagonistic relationships. Cuba and Mexico stand out as particularly notable examples of nations that have experienced prolonged diplomatic challenges with the United States, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained positive relationships with their northern neighbor.\n\nCultural and spiritual differences played a crucial role in this historical tension. The American Protestant establishment harbored deep suspicions toward Catholic institutions, much as later generations would view political ideologies like fascism and communism with distrust. This religious divide echoed earlier Anglo-Spanish rivalries, with both nations inheriting their predecessors' mutual suspicion.\n\nHistorical records document seventeen distinct confrontations between these nations during their period of rivalry. Most incidents involved cross-border security issues, particularly bandit incursions targeting frontier settlements. These security challenges persisted until both governments implemented stronger military presence along their shared boundary.\n\nThe antagonistic relationship gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic ties with the United States. By the century's end, American interests had shifted from territorial expansion to commercial investment, fundamentally altering the dynamic between these neighboring nations.",
            "In 2008, an unexpected medical condition transformed my life overnight, leaving me incapacitated with a rare disorder I'd never heard of before.\n\nAt that point, I was working in healthcare. The decision to enter this field stemmed from my unstable childhood, seeking the promise of steady employment that everyone assured me existed in medicine. Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I opted for what seemed the safer path.\n\nThe reality hit hard when, at age 46, I found myself alone and financially vulnerable, unable to continue working. Currently, after more than a decade receiving disability benefits, my personal possessions have dwindled to almost nothing. Daily survival remains challenging, constantly threatening my sense of stability and worth. While uncertainty pervades every aspect of my existence, one truth stands out: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. Such crises have a way of revealing our fundamental vulnerability.\n\nLife's challenges, whether minor or major, arrive without warning. Despite careful planning, certain obstacles prove insurmountable without assistance. \n\nWhile I acknowledge the need to reduce dependence on federal programs in America, particularly given their current state of dysfunction, I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community connections rather than pursuing isolation. The image of each household retreating to private bunkers seems counterproductive.\n\nHistorical revisionists often glorify American individualism, but our nation's true foundation rests on community cooperation and resource sharing. Consider the westward expansion: success depended on collective effort, not solitary endeavors.\n\nPrudent preparation remains valuable. My own emergency supplies include medical provisions, water treatment equipment, protective materials, illumination sources, and non-perishable food. Those with appropriate resources should consider sustainable practices like small-scale farming and food preservation, or installing alternative heating methods where feasible.\n\nHowever, the most crucial preparation may be establishing connections within your community.",
            "During the mid-first millennium BCE, an individual emerged who would transform the spiritual landscape of Asia. This figure, later known as the Buddha, established philosophical principles that evolved into what we now recognize as Buddhism, with Theravada representing its most traditional branch. As we examine this ancient belief system, now approaching its 2,500th year, we observe significant transformations from its original form. Consider, for example, contemporary practices in Sri Lanka, where an annual ritual involving the ceremonial cutting of water demonstrates how religious expressions have expanded beyond the founder's original teachings. These evolutionary changes extend beyond mere cultural practices, reaching into fundamental theological principles. The adaptations within Theravada Buddhism, affecting both ordained and lay practitioners, reflect responses to various influences, some originating from within the tradition and others from external sources, with impacts ranging from constructive to destructive.\n\nTo properly analyze these developments, we must establish clear definitions. Influences stemming from Buddhist practitioners themselves, regardless of their status, constitute internal factors. Conversely, pressures from non-Buddhist sources represent external elements. Additionally, we distinguish between antagonistic forces - those aimed at undermining Buddhist communities - and neutral influences that, while not intentionally supportive or harmful, may nonetheless affect the tradition's development.\n\nThe foundational elements of Theravada Buddhism center on several key concepts. Practitioners seek guidance through three primary sources: the Buddha's example, his teachings (Dhamma), and the monastic community (Sangha). The canonical texts, known as the Tripitaka, encompass three distinct collections: discourses (Sutta Pitaka), monastic regulations (Vinaya Pitaka), and philosophical treatises (Abhidhamma Pitaka). Core philosophical principles include the absence of an eternal self (Anatta), the pervasive nature of suffering (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Understanding these concepts is crucial for ending the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and eliminating destructive mental states: craving, aversion, and ignorance. The tradition prescribes ethical guidelines, with lay followers observing five basic precepts prohibiting harmful actions, while monastics follow more extensive regulations. Central to Buddhist thought are the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of life's inherent challenges, identifying attachment as their source, and affirming the possibility of liberation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The impact of cultural dynamics on negotiations cannot be understated, yet we must avoid oversimplification. Cultural frameworks resist simple categorization; they are fluid, multifaceted constructs that defy broad stereotypes. Rather than making sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, successful negotiators focus on understanding how specific cultural elements influence the discussion at hand. When we encounter unfamiliar cultural territories, we inevitably filter our observations through the lens of our own experiences.\n\nTo bridge cultural divides effectively, one must invest time in comprehensive research, from historical context to contemporary social norms. Success lies not in attempting to alter or critique these cultural foundations, but in adapting one's approach to work within established parameters. This becomes particularly crucial when operating from a position of lesser leverage or in unfamiliar territory. Demonstrating genuine respect for local customs and beliefs often serves as a catalyst for overcoming cultural obstacles.\n\nCultural considerations extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its distinct ethos, manifesting in various ways – from workplace scheduling preferences to communication hierarchies. These differences appear in numerous forms: dress requirements, management structures, and even charitable involvement policies. The American corporate landscape exemplifies this diversity, with marked variations not only between organizations but also across geographical locations and urban-suburban divides. While some societies may present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals subtle but significant internal variations.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides crucial insight into cultural motivations. In societies where collective harmony and reputation preservation are paramount, negotiators typically avoid actions that might compromise organizational or leadership standing. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may focus more intensely on securing advantageous terms. While these broad cultural patterns merit consideration, developing personal rapport with negotiating counterparts remains essential for optimal outcomes.",
            "In examining religious philosophical discourse, we encounter a fascinating dichotomy between two medieval thinkers' approaches to proving divine existence. The biblical assertion \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" serves as a launching point for both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas in their respective theological arguments. When evaluating their contrasting methodologies, we must operate within the framework of Christian theology, specifically addressing the Judeo-Christian conception of God, rather than entertaining broader theological possibilities.\n\nBoth philosophers, while contributing significantly to theological discourse, fall short of providing an exhaustive foundation for religious belief. Consider Anselm's methodology: he proposes an introspective approach to understanding divinity. His argument centers on the premise that our ability to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence. The core of his reasoning suggests that our cognitive capacity to understand the concept of God necessitates God's existence. This internal, contemplative approach emphasizes personal revelation over external validation.\n\nIn contrast, Aquinas develops a markedly different framework, constructing his argument on empirical foundations. His methodology aligns more closely with scientific reasoning, presenting five distinct logical pathways to prove divine existence. These \"Five Ways\" encompass observations about change, causation, necessity, perfection, and cosmic order. Aquinas's approach mirrors solving a complex equation - each variable leads inevitably to a divine constant. His reasoning suggests that just as one can deduce the properties of an unseen puzzle piece by examining the surrounding pieces and the overall image, one can logically demonstrate God's existence through observable phenomena.",
            "Literary works often employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In examining \"The Great Gatsby,\" one discovers that its creator employs an array of literary devices to achieve particular effects. The narrative occasionally features unconventional pairings of descriptors and objects, creating unique atmospheric qualities. Additionally, the work demonstrates masterful symbolic representation, particularly through its strategic deployment of chromatic imagery. Several hues - including aureate, verdant, alabaster/slate, and crimson/rose - carry significant weight throughout the narrative. The novel constructs deliberate color associations, specifically with ivory/ash and scarlet/blush tones, subsequently utilizing these established meanings to trigger specific emotional responses regarding key elements.\n\nThe ivory/ash spectrum within the text represents conformity, with the former suggesting refinement and social elevation, while the latter implies deterioration and staleness. This symbolic framework emerges early through persistent references. The narrative's socialites consistently appear in pristine attire - from the protagonist's attendance at lavish gatherings in pale garments to various characters' light-colored wardrobes. The sole deviation occurs during the description of elaborate festivities, where vibrant primary colors dominate. This color scheme extends beyond clothing to characterize mundane elements: metropolitan thoroughfares, guest registers, residential complexes - all described in pale or ashen tones. Similarly, ordinary individuals and locations receive these chromatic descriptors: privileged upbringings, industrial wastelands, anonymous immigrants, and aging vendors.\n\nFollowing this established symbolism, the author leverages these shades to denote mundanity or conformity. This technique becomes particularly evident in the portrayal of a central figure, whose repeated association with pale hues gradually transforms her from a distinctive individual into a mere trophy - an object of desire rather than a fully realized character. This chromatic characterization persists throughout pivotal scenes, reinforcing her role as more symbolic than substantial.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under ideal weather conditions, featuring abundant sunshine and temperate seasons. The region's farms yield an impressive array of produce, spanning from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh leafy vegetables and aromatic herbs. Local consumers demonstrate strong support for community-based agriculture, particularly organic operations, with demand frequently exceeding supply. These enterprises often extend beyond mere food production, welcoming visitors for educational tours and outdoor activities.\n\nModern agricultural ventures in this region can leverage various governmental support mechanisms while simultaneously fostering environmental stewardship. Such operations frequently incorporate public engagement through guided experiences and educational initiatives, creating multiple revenue streams.\n\nThe transition to organic farming practices presents both opportunities and challenges. While these methods promote ecological diversity and environmental health through chemical-free cultivation, they demand significant investments in labor and expertise. Farmers must navigate increased operational costs, from manual pest control to natural soil enrichment strategies. Additional conservation efforts, such as implementing rotational grazing systems and maintaining specific habitat conditions, further compound these expenses.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property bordering Potrero, California, adjacent to Cleveland National Forest. This diverse landscape encompasses chaparral, introduced Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodlands, falling within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone. The area falls under the jurisdiction of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which monitors numerous threatened species including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nHistorical records indicate indigenous occupation spanning millennia, followed by nineteenth-century settlement by ranchers and wood merchants. The land's heritage as a homestead suggests a history of pastoral and timber activities. This analysis employed current real estate listings and available conservation programs to evaluate viable strategies for sustainable agricultural operations, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection - one that transcends ordinary relationships. This special bond encompasses numerous emotional facets: affection, admiration, competition, and sometimes even malice. No one comprehends a sibling quite like another sibling, as they function almost like mirrors to one another. Crisis situations often reveal the true essence of these relationships, whether positive or negative. However, these revelations frequently come at significant personal cost. Understanding sibling dynamics means accepting responsibility for the outcomes they generate. When siblings observe each other, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than their public personas. Their genuine character emerges through their choices and subsequent results.\n\nIn analyzing \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" we witness this dynamic between two siblings navigating their complex relationship. Set against a richly detailed Southern backdrop, their story unfolds as an exercise in futility. The narrative culminates in a tragic scene where pride collides with devastating failure, resulting in a single survivor. The author conveys these themes through careful development of the older brother's character, the siblings' interactions, and first-person narration that reveals the protagonist's internal struggles and worldview - elements that significantly influence the story's trajectory.\n\nThe older brother's motivations stem primarily from his overwhelming pride. From his initial interactions with his younger brother Doodle through their final tragic encounter, he harbors complicated feelings about his sibling's limitations. He had envisioned teaching a brother various physical activities - swimming, climbing, and exploring the local wilderness. He longed for a companion to share adventures with, someone who could match his physical capabilities. These aspirations proved impossible given Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival. Physical exertion posed a significant risk to Doodle's health, crushing his brother's expectations. The protagonist's disappointment manifests darkly - he even contemplates infanticide at one point, revealing disturbing psychological depths. Yet Doodle's innocent smile transforms their relationship, suggesting that beneath the protagonist's pride lies genuine fraternal affection.",
            "Our cognitive apparatus - the mind - functions as an intricate system that processes and interprets information in remarkable ways. Throughout history, scholars have drawn various parallels to explain its operation, evolving from simple analogies like wax tablets to more sophisticated comparisons with modern computing systems. However, we must exercise caution with such comparisons, as they often fall short of capturing the mind's true complexity.\n\nThe journey of information through our neural pathways begins when our sense organs convert physical phenomena - whether tactile sensations, thermal energy, acoustic waves, or light particles - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through parallel processing streams. Consider viewing a geometric shape: elementary processing identifies basic attributes like hue and edges, while higher-order processing integrates this data with existing knowledge to facilitate rapid recognition.\n\nSelective attention mechanisms act as gatekeepers, determining which signals merit further cognitive resources. While countless sensory inputs bombard us continuously, these mechanisms filter out non-essential information. This explains why we might overlook mundane details like individual grass blades beneath our feet, yet instantly recognize our name in crowded, noisy environments. This filtering process occurs continuously across multiple processing stages.\n\nInformation storage occurs across several memory systems, including immediate sensory registers, temporary working memory, and permanent long-term storage. The encoding process varies by sensory modality. Take linguistic information: it can be encoded based on visual appearance, phonetic properties, or meaning. Research with various species suggests that working memory - which spans approximately twenty seconds - relies on reverberating neural circuits, while long-term storage likely involves protein structure modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks to explain knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurobiology. One prominent theory suggests that knowledge exists as interconnected conceptual nodes. Within this framework, related concepts form associative networks - for instance, linking furniture items like chairs and tables with their common properties, such as being wooden.",
            "The global economic landscape underwent a seismic shift during 2007 when a devastating financial catastrophe engulfed the United States. As unemployment figures soared and real estate values plummeted, numerous prominent financial institutions faced unprecedented challenges. This economic downturn continues to reverberate through our society, prompting critical examination of its origins and potential preventive measures for the future.\n\nThe catalyst for this economic tsunami can be traced to misguided regulatory decisions and institutional practices. Financial entities faced mounting pressure to distribute high-risk loans within an inadequately prepared market infrastructure. Subsequently, major government-sponsored enterprises like FNMA and FHLMC were compelled to process and restructure these mortgages into complex financial instruments. The eventual default cascade triggered a chain reaction, depleting bank reserves and contaminating the broader economic ecosystem.\n\nThe groundwork for this crisis emerged during the late 1990s under President Clinton's administration. Seeking to bolster public approval, his government implemented more lenient lending policies. Contemporary reporting by the New York Times' Steven Holmes highlighted FNMA's predicament, noting increased governmental pressure to expand credit accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes presciently warned about potential consequences during economic downturns, drawing parallels to previous financial sector interventions.\n\nMultiple elements converged to create this perfect storm, including revolutionary mortgage products. The widespread adoption of variable-rate mortgages and sophisticated debt instruments created unprecedented interconnections within the economy. This heightened exposure to real estate market fluctuations left both households and financial markets particularly vulnerable to market corrections.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually declined, institutions holding mortgage-backed securities faced severe consequences. Major investment banks collectively reported mortgage obligations exceeding $4.1 trillion by 2007, representing nearly one-third of America's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of several prestigious financial institutions, while government-sponsored enterprises, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, required federal intervention by late 2008.",
            "Let's discuss the pitfalls of exposition in storytelling. While it might seem tempting to unleash a torrent of background information, this approach often backfires spectacularly. Even experienced writers sometimes catch themselves drowning their readers in unnecessary details, prompting frustrated responses from their audience.\n\nRemember: exposition should be your servant, not your master.\n\nWriters frequently encounter the age-old advice to \"show, don't tell,\" yet many of us - myself included - occasionally fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs, or conversely, too much happens at once. It's like having two competing voices in your head: one urging you to quickly dispense with background information, the other insisting that every minute detail of every character's past must be shared.\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition delivers information directly to the audience. Consider how movies often handle this through dialogue between characters, with one person conveniently explaining everything to another. In written narratives, the author assumes this role.\n\nConsider this scenario: A story briefly mentions that two characters met, married, and tragically parted through death - all within a couple of pages and minimal dialogue. This approach does a disservice to the narrative. Instead, readers deserve to witness the husband's character through his actions and words, to understand why the heroine fell in love, and to feel the depth of their connection. This investment makes readers genuine participants in the heroine's grief, creating a deeper emotional resonance.\n\nThe difference lies between stating \"They met, married, and parted\" and crafting a living, breathing narrative.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to dump information, even when introducing new characters. Yes, that gas station night manager might be an ex-Air Force veteran with two marriages behind him who enjoys fishing and harbors dreams of ownership - but these details deserve to emerge naturally, not in one overwhelming burst.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable broadcasts on NBC 4. The morning programming began with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended an individual following an assault on his spouse involving multiple stab wounds. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nSubsequently, the broadcast covered an incident involving an 18-year-old shooting victim in the Sharon Woods district. The victim sustained critical injuries, and law enforcement, including SWAT personnel, were actively investigating with no suspects identified. The abbreviated coverage of this incident raised questions about potential media bias in crime reporting across different demographic groups.\n\nThe broadcast then addressed an aviation security concern involving a Med-Flight helicopter that sustained damage from what investigators determined to be a .22 caliber rifle round. Authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to an arrest.\n\nWeather coverage followed, highlighting anticipated precipitation and electrical storms for the weekend, with temperature forecasts remaining consistent in the 80-85°F range. This segment appeared deliberately concise to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe news team then reported on a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, providing detailed physical descriptions of the suspect. The emphasis placed on certain aspects of the suspect's appearance seemed disproportionate to the story's context.\n\nThe final segment covered a narcotics trafficking case involving an individual convicted of marijuana distribution between Texas and Ohio. The reporting included an unusual presentation of the sentence duration in months rather than years, and included demographic details that appeared superfluous to the core story.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with the trading flexibility of common stocks. These investment vehicles mirror specific indices, commodities, or asset groups while offering enhanced liquidity through exchange-based trading. Market participants can leverage ETF shares similarly to individual stocks, including options for short selling, margin trading, and fractional share purchases.\n\nThe financial advantages of ETFs extend beyond their operational flexibility. These instruments typically maintain significantly reduced expense ratios compared to conventional mutual funds, although investors should note that brokerage commissions apply to ETF transactions. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across various sectors and investment strategies.\n\nHowever, prudent investors should conduct thorough due diligence regarding marketed advantages such as portfolio diversification. This investigation focuses on analyzing the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF) in comparison to its principal components. The research aims to determine whether holding the ETF provides comparable benefits to maintaining discrete positions in its primary constituents, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns.\n\nMethodologically, this analysis concentrates on the fund's top ten holdings, which collectively represent 63.58% of total assets, as examining all components would prove impractical. To assess how effectively these primary positions reflect the complete fund's characteristics, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the corresponding portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns.\n\nThe computational results reveal intriguing disparities: a hypothetical portfolio comprising solely the top ten holdings demonstrates a return premium of 6.11% (representing a 16% performance differential) while maintaining a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. These preliminary findings suggest the potential superiority of a concentrated portfolio strategy. Nevertheless, further statistical analysis becomes necessary to determine whether these performance differentials maintain statistical significance.\n\nTo facilitate this statistical evaluation, we calculated and normalized the standard deviations for each component security to enable meaningful comparison with the aggregate fund's volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of the participation data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a concerning decline in commuter log entries during the project's third month. Multiple factors potentially contributed to this downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our northeastern institution naturally discouraged both cycling and pedestrian commuting. The academic calendar also played a significant role, as December brings final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties that consume the campus community's attention. Moreover, the extended winter break means many community members are absent from campus entirely.\n\nWhile these factors partially explain the December and January participation rates, the February numbers remain puzzling. One theory suggests that such initiatives often experience natural enthusiasm cycles, with initial excitement giving way to reduced engagement over time. Our response was to implement a focused \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, which successfully boosted participation rates. This experience highlighted two key operational challenges: maintaining momentum despite natural engagement cycles and adapting to academic calendar disruptions.\n\nThe project also confronted deeply ingrained cultural preferences for personal vehicle use, which offers unmatched convenience and autonomy. To counter this, we implemented an incentive structure featuring gift certificates to various local establishments, including dining venues, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating escalating prize values throughout the project timeline might have better sustained participation. For instance, introducing high-value rewards like premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles during later project phases could have prevented the observed engagement decline. While our initial incentives proved adequate for launch, a graduated reward system featuring increasingly substantial prizes might have better maintained community interest and participation levels throughout the project duration.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, specifically analyzing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces showcase innovative editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unique deviations in these early cinematic works.\n\nThe majority of these productions adhered to specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a theater-style presentation, maintained stationary camera positions, employed broader viewing angles, and typically contained just one continuous scene. However, some pioneering works from the early 1900s began challenging these established norms by incorporating multiple scenes.\n\nA striking characteristic shared among these productions was their theatrical staging. The camera remained fixed, similar to an audience member's perspective in a theater, never following the performers' movements. This approach clearly drew inspiration from stage performances, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts. This setup naturally constrained performer movement to lateral directions, as demonstrated in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors traverse the screen horizontally rather than approaching or retreating from the viewing perspective.\n\nThe theatrical influence extended to shot composition as well. Directors favored wide and occasional medium-range shots, completely avoiding close-ups throughout this period. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences simultaneously view the entire stage performance. The performers maintained their distance from the camera, preserving this theatrical perspective.\n\nThese productions typically consisted of what appeared to be single, continuous takes, usually running under sixty seconds. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, resulting in brief, vaudeville-style demonstrations focusing on magical effects rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that what viewers perceived as single shots often involved multiple cleverly merged segments. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate footage segments merge to create the illusion.",
            "Literary scholars often note that Gothic fiction represents a fascinating paradox: simultaneously embracing antiquity and modernity. This duality manifests in both its nomenclature and essence, as noted in Ian Watt's scholarly examination of the genre's emergence. Throughout its evolution, the Gothic literary movement has experienced dramatic shifts in critical reception, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nWhen Horace Walpole introduced The Castle of Otranto, widely acknowledged as the genre's cornerstone, he deliberately merged classical romantic elements with contemporary narrative techniques. His innovative approach, which he dubbed \"A Gothic Story,\" synthesized theatrical conventions from earlier periods with realistic character portrayals typical of contemporary fiction. The term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations, referring variously to historical periods, architectural styles, and cultural movements. During Walpole's era, many viewed gothic elements as primitive compared to contemporary literary developments. However, this unique fusion of theatrical gothic elements with novel-length psychological exploration has granted the genre remarkable staying power, allowing it to feel simultaneously historical and contemporary to readers across generations.\n\nThe medieval concept of chivalry emerges as a central theme in Gothic literature, particularly evident in The Castle of Otranto. This focus on chivalric ideals reflects contemporary anxieties about moral decay in society. Writing during politically turbulent times, Walpole appeared to view the medieval period as a moral golden age, contrasting sharply with what he perceived as the degradation of his era. This perspective manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. As a prince who has endured significant hardship and is believed to have fallen to infidels, Frederic exemplifies the archetypal \"gallant and courteous Knight\" - though his characterization ventures into hyperbole, establishing what would become a hallmark of Gothic excess.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept emerged in 1982, credited to consultant Keith Oliver, who articulated it as a comprehensive methodology for orchestrating and supervising supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements efficiently.\n\nAt its core, supply chain management rests on six fundamental pillars: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock control, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodologies for product creation. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the primary barometer of consumer demands. This market intelligence guides decisions about product selection and volume requirements. Subsequently, facility selection occurs, with emphasis on optimizing production capacity and quality standards while ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce manufacturing sites are determined, attention shifts to workflow coordination and equipment upkeep. The manufacturing phase demands meticulous attention to detail, as oversights can result in significant financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nResource procurement, the second pillar, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Organizations often maintain multiple production units for single items, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize process allocation across these units or potentially engage external partners. The primary motivation for outsourcing stems from the pursuit of velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while achieving or preserving cost efficiency.",
            "Literature from the Victorian era typically showcases meticulous descriptive elements and predominantly centers on upper-class society. However, two notable exceptions to this pattern emerge in the form of \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These works diverge from conventional Victorian literature by incorporating mysterious elements and unusual narrative approaches, which serve to enhance character development and provide deeper insights into their psychological states and emotional motivations.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth narratives employ dream sequences and hallucinatory states, though each serves distinct purposes. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these surreal episodes illuminate the protagonist's internal struggles and his growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this effectively. Through a dreamlike recollection, Oliver experiences the trauma anew, highlighting his powerlessness in the face of events beyond his control. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore both his physical deterioration and psychological torment. The scene's sensory confusion - where pain becomes a constant rather than an acute sensation - emphasizes his disorientation and vulnerability. This portrayal raises questions about agency and fate, suggesting Oliver's increasing resignation to his circumstances, possibly indicating Fagin's successful manipulation of his spirit. His lack of self-preservation instinct during this critical moment implies a deepening surrender to despair.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my tenure as an elementary school tutor, I encountered a memorable case that highlighted a significant educational challenge. The student, Adrian, appeared to be a native English speaker despite his Hispanic background, yet he demonstrated unusual difficulties with reading. His letter recognition pattern was inconsistent - some perfectly clear, others completely foreign to him.\n\nThe breakthrough came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's primary exposure to written language had been through Spanish alphabet conventions. While verbally fluent in English, he struggled with the fundamentals of English orthography.\n\nThis experience illuminates a broader issue within our educational system, particularly in California's diverse linguistic landscape. The challenge extends beyond obvious language barriers - even students who appear fully assimilated may face hidden obstacles in literacy acquisition. The solution requires a multi-faceted approach combining various methodologies: dual-language instruction, immersion programs, individualized tutoring, and structured ESL support.\n\nResearch demonstrates that dual-language education yields superior academic outcomes across all student populations. Despite concerns about resource allocation, implementing comprehensive bilingual programs benefits both native English speakers and language learners. While universal teacher bilingualism remains impractical, incorporating specialized bilingual support staff offers a viable solution for creating inclusive learning environments.",
            "Throughout human history, people have grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. Different cultures address this through various institutions: churches, synagogues, or personal meditation. While many individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions without question, others staunchly reject any notion of supernatural forces, choosing instead to view existence through a purely individualistic lens. Our spiritual journeys often evolve, with beliefs shifting and transforming as we mature. Each person's quest for meaning represents a unique expedition through life's mysteries, as we all seek illumination amid life's uncertainties.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I shared a quiet moment with my father on our home's veranda. \"Cardinals are my favorite,\" he responded when I inquired about birds. The rainfall created a rhythmic symphony against the metal roofing while we shared a smoke. Overflowing gutters drenched the garden below. His gaze wandered distantly across the landscape, his frame noticeably diminished from illness. His once-full head of hair had thinned considerably. Words about our impending separation remained unspoken, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, I simply moved closer, and together we observed the summer shower as dusk approached.\n\nThat winter, shortly after I turned twenty-two, my father succumbed to his illness. Despite aggressive medical interventions extending his life beyond predictions, I questioned their purpose given his prolonged suffering. My faith wavered; the concept of a benevolent deity seemed impossible in the face of such cruelty. During sleepless nights, prayer felt futile - as if any divine presence had long since abandoned me.\n\nI made a conscious choice to avoid witnessing his final moments. As his only offspring, I understood him profoundly enough to know he wouldn't want me present for that culminating scene. I preferred preserving memories of his vitality rather than his decline. Isolated in my bedroom, I spent three days awaiting inevitable news.\n\nThe notification never came through any phone call.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideals, the agriculturalist and political figure John Taylor of Caroline stands prominent. His agricultural background, combined with his political endeavors, shaped him into a passionate defender of individual liberties and limited governance. Agricultural principles fundamentally influenced his perspectives on governmental matters, from constitutional interpretation to judicial philosophy, as he sought to protect what he viewed as humanity's noblest profession.\n\nTaylor recognized America's unique position to establish an unprecedented governmental framework, unfettered by historical precedents. He emphasized the interconnected nature of fundamental human rights, arguing that these liberties formed an inseparable whole - compromise one, and the entire structure would eventually collapse. In his view, civilization must transcend the primitive \"state of nature\" where physical strength and cunning dominated, instead establishing protections for all citizens.\n\nThe establishment of an effective society, Taylor maintained, required governmental structures acknowledging humanity's moral complexity. His framework recognized both virtuous and corrupt human tendencies, asserting that \"governmental characteristics mirror human nature.\" He championed policies protecting private property and agricultural development while opposing capitalistic excess. Taylor acknowledged self-interest as a universal human motivator but distinguished between its constructive and destructive manifestations.\n\nRegarding constitutional matters, Taylor aligned with contemporary Republican thought, advocating strict constitutional interpretation. He favored severely limited federal authority, restricting it to explicitly granted powers. While supporting literal constitutional reading, he emphasized the importance of understanding the founders' original intent. Notably, Taylor elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more explicit affirmation of state sovereignty over national unity.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, taking in the scene before me with clinical detachment. Like a scientist observing a specimen, I processed the visual information without emotional investment, my thoughts flowing like water through a sieve – present one moment, gone the next.\n\nI recalled a time when I had pursued artistic endeavors. Following a colleague's suggestion, I had invested in Betty Edwards' renowned instructional text on drawing. The book's methodology included a fascinating technique of frame isolation – reducing complex scenes to manageable segments for artistic interpretation. This approach transformed overwhelming panoramas into digestible visual elements.\n\nBut in this moment, no artistic framework could contain what lay before me. The sight commanded my full attention, demanding acknowledgment in its raw authenticity. While the great masters had their signature palettes – Picasso's blues, Monet's verdant landscapes – here was my own peculiar canvas, a monochromatic study in earthen hues.\n\nI reached for my tool with practiced precision, my movements deliberate and measured. The porcelain throne before me held its unwanted offering, resistant to the rushing waters I summoned. Each pull of the handle sent crystalline streams swirling, yet the stubborn mass remained unmoved, anchored like barnacles to a ship's hull.\n\nThere I stood in my retail uniform, complete with regulation green necktie, contemplating this unexpected challenge in the Rite Aid restroom. After several unsuccessful attempts at hydraulic persuasion, I resorted to more direct measures. Methodically wrapping my hand in protective layers of tissue, I steeled myself for the task ahead. With the determination of someone reaching into an oven to retrieve a well-done roast, I extended my hand toward the bowl's depths...",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among adolescent drivers demands our immediate attention. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates that neurological development in adolescents remains insufficient for handling the complexities of operating motor vehicles. The combination of underdeveloped decision-making capabilities and limited driving experience creates a perfect storm of risk factors.\n\nStudies conducted by various research organizations highlight a disturbing correlation between passenger age demographics and collision frequency. This data becomes particularly relevant when considering the social patterns of young drivers, who frequently transport their peers.\n\nWhile various jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing programs to mitigate these risks, such measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem persists: physiologically and psychologically, young drivers consistently demonstrate inadequate capacity for managing automotive responsibilities.\n\nDistinguished psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research, as reported in USA Today, indicates that risk-seeking behavior peaks during late adolescence, suggesting that even 18-year-olds may lack the maturity necessary for safe driving. This propensity for thrill-seeking, combined with the projected surge in eligible young drivers as children of Baby Boomers reach driving age, portends a potentially catastrophic increase in roadway fatalities.\n\nA practical solution exists through comprehensive federal legislation. Educational institutions could maintain their driver education programs, but actual licensure would be restricted to individuals 18 and older. The existing framework of provisional permits and supervised training requirements could remain intact, utilizing current state-mandated guidelines for practical experience. For instance, jurisdictions like California already mandate specific training requirements: 6 hours of professional instruction plus 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven that mortality statistics among young drivers remain consistent across state lines, implementing uniform national standards represents a logical approach to addressing this critical public safety concern. This proposed regulatory framework builds upon existing precedents rather than introducing radical changes.",
            "An Overview of Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nThe following discussion examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) through three distinct lenses: its fundamental definition, diagnostic procedures, and classroom accommodations for affected students.\n\nCAPD, alternatively known as APD, represents a unique neurological condition affecting auditory information processing. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's 2005 guidelines, this disorder impacts how effectively the brain processes acoustic signals. Interestingly, individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing capabilities but struggle with the brain's interpretation of auditory input, such as distinguishing specific voices amid background noise or processing verbal communications effectively.\n\nThe historical trajectory of CAPD research began during the 1950s, when scientists initially labeled the condition \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking developments emerged through Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari's pioneering assessment methods in 1954. Subsequently, Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961 revolutionized our understanding of auditory processing pathways. A pivotal 1977 conference catalyzed extensive research initiatives focusing on pediatric CAPD cases.\n\nCAPD's symptom profile encompasses various challenges: spatial sound orientation difficulties, problems distinguishing between concurrent sounds, pattern recognition deficits, inability to detect vocal nuances (including emotional undertones), auditory masking issues, difficulties synthesizing acoustic information, and challenges with sequential auditory processing.\n\nDiagnostic procedures typically involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by multidisciplinary teams, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments incorporate behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory testing protocols. Currently, no singular diagnostic tool definitively identifies CAPD, and its etiology remains unclear. Contemporary evaluation methods often utilize dichotic listening tasks and sophisticated acoustic response measurements to assess auditory processing capabilities.",
            "My aspiration to join the Division of Family and Children Services stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for vulnerable youth and support families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with personal challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping mechanisms. These observations guided me toward completing my Psychology degree at Piedmont College in 2009. Following graduation, I took time to reflect on my career direction. A pivotal moment occurred when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse at a friend's home. The subsequent day brought news of police involvement at his family residence. Drawing upon my psychology background, I offered assistance at the scene. When law enforcement requested my help in communicating with the parents, their defensive responses and dismissive attitude toward serious family conflicts solidified my resolve to pursue social work.\n\nThe principle of social justice particularly resonates with my worldview. Contemporary society presents a paradox: while claiming to value individuality, it often promotes conformity. My personal journey reflects a consistent challenge to societal norms and prejudices. Throughout my academic career, I actively demonstrated my commitment to social justice through various forms of self-expression and advocacy. This included supporting LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA participation, confronting racial discrimination, and expressing individuality through personal appearance choices. My dedication to promoting social justice remains unwavering and will continue to inform my professional practice.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through two distinct frameworks: the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives. While biological approaches emphasize hereditary factors and physiological mechanisms, sociocultural analyses concentrate on environmental influences, including demographic variables and cultural contexts. This examination delves into both paradigms, presenting relevant research and evaluating their respective merits and limitations.\n\nSleep disturbances manifest in various categories: they may exist independently, emerge alongside other psychological conditions, or stem from external factors. Independent sleep disorders encompass two main groups: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The former includes conditions like Primary Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and several others, while Parasomnias encompass disorders such as night terrors and sleepwalking. When these disturbances coincide with other psychological conditions, they're typically associated with either Clinical or Personality Disorders.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, research has illuminated fascinating neurological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Scientists have identified crucial neurons within the hypothalamus that contain orexin, which plays a vital role in sleep-wake cycles. Recent studies involving laboratory mice have revealed that GABAB receptors on these neurons significantly influence sleep patterns. When researchers activated specific receptors using baclofen (a GABAB agonist), they observed increased sleep duration. These findings suggest potential therapeutic approaches for sleep disorders, though more research is needed to fully understand their implications for human subjects. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, potentially affecting their academic performance, professional life, and overall well-being.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've gained considerable insight into the transportation challenges that plague our expanding campus. During my initial year, my residence in Stuart Hall, situated in East Halls, positioned me at what felt like the campus periphery. The journey to central locations like Willard Building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nAn interesting conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast empty spaces. Today, those areas have transformed into athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, plus numerous residential developments. This expansion, while beneficial for the university's growth, has intensified transportation difficulties.\n\nIn contemplating solutions to this mobility challenge, one option stands paramount: cycling. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after abandoning it for several years. Their enthusiasm was palpable as they declared cycling's superiority for campus navigation, despite its temporary decline in popularity. Beyond its health advantages, cycling represents the most energy-efficient transportation method available - a simple breakfast can fuel considerable distance.\n\nNow residing off-campus at a distance comparable to some university housing, I've discovered that cycling has revolutionized my daily routine. The trek to Thomas Building, typically requiring 25 minutes by foot, now takes merely 5 minutes with vigorous pedaling. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking maintains its merits, my packed schedule necessitates faster transportation. The time savings are substantial - cycling eliminates roughly 150 minutes of walking weekly, considering just one daily class commute. Factor in additional campus movements, and the temporal benefits become even more significant.",
            "In his masterwork Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a disturbing future society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes personal autonomy, and the pursuit of pleasure has become life's primary directive. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere components in an elaborate social machine.\n\nA close reading through Marxist interpretation reveals profound commentary on societal control mechanisms. The text demonstrates multiple parallels with Marxist concepts, particularly regarding social homogenization and the transformation of human experience into commodity. These elements suggest Huxley's deep-seated concerns about the direction of modern economic systems.\n\nThe novel's society exemplifies what Marx termed \"false consciousness,\" where populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. This manifests clearly in the rigid caste system, where lower classes (Deltas, Gammas) are programmed through sleep-learning to embrace consumerist behaviors and their predetermined social roles. The World Controller orchestrates this grand deception, wielding complete authority over the populace's thoughts and desires.\n\nSocial interactions in this society lack genuine emotional depth. Characters appear as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals, suggesting the dehumanizing effects of technological determinism and market forces. Meaningful connections are absent; instead, relationships remain shallow, with men viewing women primarily as objects of pleasure (\"pneumatic\"), while women discuss intimate encounters with clinical detachment. Each social stratum's acceptance of their position reflects Marx's observations about how capitalism maintains control through false consciousness, with individuals believing in their own fulfillment while serving merely as cogs in the consumer machine.\n\nThe class structure's rigid maintenance through psychological conditioning demonstrates how power systems perpetuate themselves by creating willing participants in their own subjugation. The lower classes remain blissfully unaware of their manipulation, while most upper-class citizens (Alphas and Betas) choose comfortable compliance over questioning the status quo.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that sparked an ongoing intellectual curiosity about religious tolerance in contemporary society. The discourse surrounding Islam, particularly in the post-9/11 era, has undergone a remarkable transformation. We've witnessed a pendulum swing from initial skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic presidency of Barack Obama, whose family heritage includes Islamic influences.\n\nThe historical accounts of Muhammad's life present fascinating contradictions that warrant scholarly examination. Traditional narratives often portray him as a military strategist who expanded his influence through conquest, yet biographical sources paint a markedly different picture - one of a misunderstood spiritual leader whose followers gathered voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nWhat strikes me as particularly noteworthy are the parallels between Islamic and Christian religious narratives. Consider, for instance, the account of Muhammad multiplying food for forty individuals, which bears striking resemblance to Christian miracle accounts. These similarities raise important questions about the transmission and adaptation of religious narratives across cultural boundaries, and perhaps suggest an attempt to establish legitimacy through familiar motifs.\n\nThe biographical sources rely heavily on chains of oral transmission, a common practice in ancient historical documentation. While this methodology aimed to establish credibility through multiple attestation, modern historical criticism might question the reliability of such extensively mediated accounts.\n\nThe disparity between historical records and religious biographical accounts creates a challenging dichotomy. While religious texts present Muhammad as an exemplar of humility and wisdom, historical evidence suggests a more complex figure who wielded considerable political and military authority. This raises important questions about historical accuracy versus religious interpretation in sacred biographical literature.",
            "Historical analysis reveals that the original message of Christ became increasingly diluted as Christian theology evolved post-crucifixion. Examining this progression chronologically demonstrates an expanding divergence from initial principles. Contemporary society exhibits mounting intellectual curiosity and unprecedented liberal inclinations, though conservative elements persist in maintaining traditional interpretations. These traditionalists, while vocal, may lack sufficient numbers to shape broader societal directions.\n\nFuture decades will likely witness an expanding historical consciousness among Christian adherents, accompanied by an intensifying desire to separate subsequent theological additions from Jesus's fundamental teachings. This transformation, though potentially spanning generations or centuries, appears inevitable: Christian theology will undergo a remarkable reversal, gradually shedding accumulated doctrinal layers until reaching its foundational essence - Christ's original divine message.\n\nAs this movement gains momentum across Western nations, inspiring multitudes to embrace first-century worship practices, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their leadership role. Paradoxically, this theological retrospection will likely reduce denominational fragmentation, fostering increased uniformity in belief systems and religious practices. Historical precedent supports such dramatic reversals - consider Rome's transformation from Christian persecutor to Christian empire, or America's evolution from slave-holding nation to one embracing diverse leadership.\n\nThis impending theological reformation will largely depend upon interpreting Christ's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. But to comprehend this progression, we must examine Christianity's roots in Judaism. Prior to Rome's occupation of Jerusalem (63 BCE), Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority. Yet even then, Jewish society exhibited internal divisions among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through my analysis of The Jungle, it becomes evident that humanity's inherent nature tends toward self-interest and avarice. The narrative demonstrates how individuals prioritize their personal advancement while disregarding those beneath them in social standing. This theme manifests particularly strongly in Sinclair's portrayal of industrial leadership.\n\nThe corporate executives and facility administrators exemplify this behavior through their relentless pursuit of expansion and profit. Their actions demonstrate complete indifference to collateral damage, whether environmental or human. As Sinclair illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery powerfully conveys the environmental devastation wrought by industrial negligence. The administration's apathy extends to the toxic emissions from their facilities and the biological waste from countless animal enclosures surrounding Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation extends deeply into labor practices. As one passage notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers faced arbitrary dismissal, hazardous conditions, and excessive hours without recourse. The absence of regulatory oversight during this period enabled widespread abuse. While not explicitly stated, residents of Packingtown were expected to endure both occupational and environmental hazards without complaint. Support systems were notably absent, and even labor unions often exploited rather than protected workers. Sinclair draws a powerful parallel to slavery, noting that \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Among the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, \"Dream-land\" stands as a notable composition that the author himself held in high regard. The poem contains references to \"Thulé,\" appearing at both its beginning and end. While scholars traditionally connect this term to Virgil's description of a mysterious northern island beyond Britain's shores, contemporary research suggests an alternative inspiration.\n\nThe German literary sphere, particularly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's contributions, offers compelling connections. A fascinating parallel emerges between Poe's work and Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust,\" completed in two segments (1808 and 1832). Within \"Faust Part Two\" lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poignant narrative about a bereaved monarch who, after receiving a goblet from his dying queen, succumbs to grief and alcohol before a dramatic seaside death.\n\nThe thematic resonance between these works is striking. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" explore themes of isolation, loss, and darkness. Poe's narrator traverses a colorless realm populated by spectral memories, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's king. This parallel becomes more significant considering Poe's documented appreciation for German literature and his connection to Tennyson, another Goethe admirer.\n\nThe timing is also noteworthy - H.P. Grattan's 1842 adaptation of \"Faust\" preceded Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by mere months. This temporal proximity, combined with the works' shared motifs, suggests more than coincidental similarity. The evidence points to a deliberate artistic dialogue between these literary pieces, with Poe potentially crafting \"Dream-Land\" as a dark reflection of Goethe's earlier work.",
            "Would California law permit punitive damages in a case where a grocery store patron sustained injuries from slipping on spilled applesauce, given that the store manager deliberately ignored two staff notifications about the hazard while taking his meal break?\n\nAnalysis indicates the court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed. California statutes permit such damages when defendants exhibit \"oppression, fraud or malice\" in non-contractual matters (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294). The circumstances suggest potential malicious conduct, defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" behavior showing conscious disregard for safety.\n\nThe incident occurred at approximately 5:30 PM when Jennifer Palmer encountered the unremediated spill. Documentation shows that two staff members - R. Wayne and M. Haddigan - had separately notified Manager Paul Martin about the hazard at 5:00 PM and 5:15 PM respectively. Martin dismissed both reports, citing his dinner break as justification for inaction.\n\nSeveral factors strengthen the punitive damages argument:\n- The store's history of six similar incidents in 2009 alone\n- Martin's repeated refusal to address a known safety hazard\n- His explicit prioritization of a meal break over customer safety\n- The reasonable foreseeability of injury given past incidents\n\nWhile establishing \"despicable\" conduct presents a higher bar, Martin's pattern of negligence despite multiple prior accidents could satisfy this requirement. The manager's documented responses to staff warnings demonstrate conscious disregard for patron safety, potentially meeting the \"willful and deliberate failure\" standard outlined in Taylor v. Superior Court (1979).\n\nGiven these circumstances, summary dismissal of punitive damages would be inappropriate as sufficient evidence exists to support the claim's key elements under California law.",
            "Throughout her adolescence, an inexplicable yearning persisted within her consciousness. This peculiar sensation first manifested around her fourteenth year and maintained its presence well into her seventeenth. Eventually, the abstract longing crystallized into something more specific - a desire for companionship. Curiously, despite numerous advances from potential suitors, she remained unmoved by their attempts at courtship. This puzzling emotional state became a frequent subject of her introspection, though years of contemplation yielded no satisfactory explanations.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere of her household typically exuded tranquility. Her parents, both even-tempered individuals, rarely engaged in disputes, either with each other or their vivacious daughter. The sole source of tension arose from her assertions of autonomy. Despite inheriting their gentle nature, she possessed an effervescent personality that drew others to her naturally.\n\nHowever, this particular afternoon shattered their usual serenity. While wandering between rooms seeking creative inspiration, she detected an alarming cry emanating from the kitchen - her mother's voice distorted by pain. Rushing to investigate, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, each breath punctuated by expressions of agony. \"Hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths, directing her daughter's hands to assist. Years of physical conditioning proved invaluable as she carefully transported her injured mother to their vehicle.\n\nThe clinical environment of the emergency room, with its characteristic antiseptic atmosphere, barely registered in her consciousness as she focused solely on securing medical attention. After calling for assistance, she watched helplessly as healthcare professionals whisked her mother away on a gurney, leaving her alone with her concerns.\n\nThe incident's cause was surprisingly mundane - an unfortunate fall from a stepstool while attempting to retrieve a decorative vessel from an elevated storage space.",
            "Recent research has investigated the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns resembling those of Mediterranean coastal regions. The investigation centered on evaluating whether individuals following an adapted Mediterranean eating pattern, quantified through the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) scoring system, experienced reduced instances of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart disease and stroke-related events.\n\nThe adapted Mediterranean eating pattern emphasizes abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grain products, and protein-rich plant sources. It also promotes the use of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats over saturated alternatives, includes regular fish consumption, and permits moderate alcohol consumption while limiting animal-based products.\n\nEarlier research had demonstrated promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating patterns and decreased overall mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes. Additionally, controlled studies indicated superior outcomes in weight management and cholesterol profiles compared to traditional low-fat dietary approaches among overweight participants. However, specific impacts on stroke occurrence remained unexplored.\n\nThe research team tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals, aged 38-63, participating in the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study across 11 American states. None had pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or diabetes at enrollment. Dietary habits were assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered six times between 1984 and 2004, maintaining an exceptional 95% participant retention rate. Health outcomes were verified through medical documentation, with some cases (17% of strokes, 24% of non-fatal heart attacks) classified as probable when complete records were unavailable.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of dietary scores and incorporated adjustments for various health-related behaviors and characteristics. Statistical analysis employed Cox proportional-hazard models to evaluate relationships between dietary adherence and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant cardiovascular benefits among participants maintaining higher aMed scores. Throughout the two-decade observation period, researchers documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related fatalities. Statistical analysis showed that participants achieving the highest dietary scores demonstrated a 29% lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A solitary figure emerges from the urban landscape - actress Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, displays a provocative message on cardboard: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has endured decades of military rule since a 1962 military takeover. In 2007, the country witnessed unprecedented demonstrations, primarily led by Buddhist clergy members wearing their distinctive saffron-colored robes. What began as peaceful assemblies quickly devolved into widespread conflict between religious institutions and government forces. International media faced severe restrictions, culminating in the tragic death of Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photographer, during a demonstration. While official statistics cite merely 13 casualties, a military defector named Colonel Hla Win suggested the actual death count reached thousands.\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout human history. Ancient civilizations often justified authoritarian control through divine mandate - from Roman emperors claiming celestial approval to Japanese monarchs being revered as deities themselves. Modern governance continues to display concerning relationships between political and religious institutions, as exemplified by the interactions between President George W. Bush and religious leader Ted Haggard.\n\nHistorical precedents demonstrate the devastating impact of authoritarian control. The 1989 Tiananmen Square incident resulted in significant casualties, with estimates varying dramatically between government figures (200-300) and Chinese Red Cross reports (2,000-3,000). Similarly, the 1990s Rwandan crisis saw systematic elimination of Tutsi civilians and moderate politicians by Hutu militias with government support. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany's regime represents another instance of state-sponsored persecution, targeting Jewish populations across multiple nations.",
            "The remarkable influence of Duke Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his enduring career and exceptional talent for orchestral composition. While his piano work remains understated in many pieces, his brilliance shines through his ability to craft intricate compositions that brought out the best in each musician. By establishing frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with improvisational freedom, Ellington demonstrated an uncanny ability to harness the unique qualities of individual performers while maintaining cohesive ensemble sound.\n\nThe musical encyclopedia Grove highlights Creole Love Call as a prime example of Ellington's innovative approach to incorporating vocals as instrumental elements. This twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six distinct choruses, each showcasing different aspects of his orchestration mastery:\n\nInitially, vocals and reeds engage in dialogue, transitioning from smooth to coarse tones. A muted trumpet then takes center stage, expanding upon the core melody with extended blue notes. The third chorus features soaring clarinet work accompanied by delicate piano syncopation. The fourth movement brings the full ensemble into play, with brass and reeds echoing the opening dialogue. The piece reaches its peak in the fifth chorus through high-register reed work against punctuated brass and rhythm. The final chorus mirrors the opening structure before concluding with a brief coda featuring vocal flourishes and unconventional trombone resolution.\n\nThis innovative vocal integration appears throughout Ellington's repertoire, as evidenced in Hot and Bothered, where \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet converses with Baby Cox's scatting, creating an intriguing blend of instrumental and vocal timbres. Similarly, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's distinctive muted trombone introduction, further demonstrating Ellington's gift for leveraging individual talents within his compositions.",
            "What mechanisms drive evolutionary pathways in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the factors that channel evolutionary trajectories, yet our ability to describe biological forms mathematically remains limited - a challenge first noted by D'Arcy Thompson over a century ago. Recent advances have enabled researchers to apply mathematical frameworks to analyze shell formation in mollusks, both during individual development and across evolutionary time scales.\n\nOur research focuses on the genus Prunum, where we combine mathematical modeling with experimental approaches to investigate evolutionary-developmental patterns. By analyzing X-ray images of various Prunum species, we extracted quantitative measurements that were input into CerioShell software to generate both theoretical and actual shell configurations. This allowed us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological variations within this group. We are integrating these computational results with laboratory observations to better comprehend large-scale evolutionary transitions in these organisms.\n\nThe architecture of mollusk shells follows fascinating geometric principles. Each shell essentially consists of a tubular structure that coils through space, completing 360-degree rotations. These rotational segments, termed whorls, wrap around a central columella. The growth pattern varies in expansion rate, with adjacent whorls separated by a linear depression called a suture. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically achieves the largest diameter. Above it lies the spire, encompassing all previous whorls, which terminates in the apex. The base occupies the opposite end, featuring the aperture - the opening through which the animal emerges.\n\nShell orientation can be described from multiple perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard presentation shows the shell in apertural view, with the opening facing the observer and apex directed upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a standardized protocol. Beginning with an apical view, one identifies the initial suture point and draws a reference line across the shell. Counting proceeds from this line, with measurements precise to quarter-whorl increments.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a series of successive apertures moving through four-dimensional space as the organism constructs its shell. This progression can be mapped using coordinates that track aperture centers and dimensional measurements. Such data enable both graphical and mathematical representations, allowing researchers to model variations in shell formation processes.",
            "Recent data indicates that Indonesia's progress in reducing newborn and infant death rates has stagnated during the previous decade. Despite achieving success in various Millennium Development Goals, particularly regarding water access and sanitation improvements, progress in both child and maternal healthcare falls significantly behind schedule for meeting 2015 objectives. Several factors contribute to these challenges, suggesting that broad healthcare infrastructure enhancement might prove more beneficial than isolated program-specific solutions.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has achieved a 72% rate of professionally-attended births, this statistic requires careful interpretation. Many of these attendants include traditional birthing assistants who lack medical expertise for managing complications, particularly in cases of severe bleeding, which remains a leading cause of maternal fatality. Furthermore, professional medical treatment for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions has decreased. Available information about post-birth care, though limited, suggests widespread inadequacies throughout the nation.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% nationwide. A stark urban-rural divide exists, with cities reporting 7% cesarean rates compared to just 2% in rural regions. This disparity highlights significant healthcare accessibility issues across different geographical areas. Economic disparities further compound these challenges, with a 27% difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies for enhancement, policymakers face a crucial decision between targeted programmatic interventions and comprehensive healthcare system strengthening. While specialized initiatives offer clear objectives and quick results, they present notable disadvantages. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other critical healthcare areas and create inefficient parallel systems with redundant administrative burdens. The HIV/AIDS funding impact on family planning services exemplifies these unintended consequences.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing numerous genres that defy simple categorization. Each primary musical style - whether it's jazz, rap, rock, folk, or country - has branched into countless subdivisions, creating an intricate web of musical expression. Among these, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly noteworthy, having evolved into an extraordinarily complex and emotionally charged genre since its emergence four decades ago.\n\nHeavy Metal's emotional palette, while predominantly exploring darker themes, demonstrates remarkable range. Its evolution has been organic and continuous, with musicians consistently pushing boundaries and establishing new subgenres. This process of musical innovation persists to this day, resulting in an ever-expanding universe of metal variations.\n\nThe contemporary metal landscape is so varied that defining its core characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has absorbed influences from numerous other musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To truly comprehend modern metal's diverse manifestations, one must examine it not merely as a genre, but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nMetal's essence lies in its intensity and complexity. It demands technical excellence from its practitioners and embraces extremes - in volume, instrumental prowess, theatrical presentation, and emotional expression. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic revolution of the 1970s, when musicians, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal distinguished itself by embracing darker themes at a time when mainstream music typically avoided such territory. Modern metal often draws inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic Era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles - widely regarded as one of heavy metal's precursors. Created as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcased the band's ability to produce darker, more intense music. Its inclusion on The White Album marked a significant moment in metal's early development, demonstrating its cyclical, drug-influenced themes.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, encompasses multiple layers of significance - it portrays both a female subject experiencing an enchanted landscape and symbolizes the artist's personal aspirations. Throughout his career, Rousseau yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental artistic challenge: whether to embrace established artistic conventions or pursue his unique creative direction.\n\nUnderstanding Rousseau's background provides essential context for interpreting The Dream. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, he came from a middle-class background, with his father working as a prosperous hardware merchant. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau lacked formal artistic training and spent his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - he lost eight children in infancy and his first wife, Clémence, leaving him with a single daughter, Julia. Art became his sanctuary and source of renewal during these difficult times. His artistic perspective reflected his working-class origins, contrasting sharply with the romanticized depictions of peasant life common among his peers.\n\nThe timing of Rousseau's artistic pursuit coincided with an era of exceptional artistic innovation, making his quest for recognition particularly challenging. Despite years of dedication, widespread appreciation for his work emerged only when artists like Matisse were gaining prominence. Art historian Jan Gordon draws an interesting comparison between these two figures, noting their contrasting motivations: while Matisse actively sought to avoid conventional artistic expression, Rousseau paradoxically aspired to create work conventional enough to gain acceptance from the established artistic community.",
            "The relationship between moral principles and artistic expression has long fascinated scholars and philosophers. This connection runs deeper than mere coincidence. While Keats famously equated truth with beauty in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" the significance of this parallel extends beyond poetic metaphor. Unlike traditional knowledge acquisition through formal education or lived experiences, our understanding of both moral principles and artistic merit seems to emerge from a more intuitive source. These fields focus primarily on analytical observation rather than prescriptive rules - we examine why certain artworks resonate or why specific actions feel ethically sound, instead of establishing rigid guidelines for creating art or determining moral behavior.\n\nInterestingly, neither artistic criticism nor ethical analysis can fully encompass the essence of their subjects. Consider discussions about masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - while experts may analyze technical elements such as composition and historical context, these aspects alone cannot explain its enduring impact. People often preface their appreciation of art with phrases like \"There's something special about it\" before delving into technical analysis. This ineffable quality exists in both artistic appreciation and moral understanding. As noted by O'Connor, narrative storytelling often communicates what direct statements cannot, suggesting that both art and ethics possess elements that transcend conventional description.\n\nThe profound connection between morality and artistic expression may stem from their shared appeal to our intuitive understanding. This link becomes particularly evident in literature, where moral considerations naturally intertwine with artistic expression. Literature holds special significance because it inherently deals with human values and ethical choices, making it uniquely positioned to explore moral dimensions in ways that other art forms might not. The value systems we encounter in literature mirror those we grapple with in real life, creating a natural bridge between artistic expression and ethical contemplation.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerhouse nation, its unified territories stretching from Munich's alpine foothills to Kiel's maritime shores along the Baltic. A common thread of identity weaves through the western city of Cologne along the Rhine, across the heartland, and reaches the historic Dresden nestled by the Elbe River. This cohesive nation-state, however, emerged from a complex tapestry of diverse peoples and ancestral groups.\n\nThe land known historically as Germania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of this designation remains contentious among academics. Historical records from Tacitus suggest the term originated with the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. The term \"Germanus\" first appeared in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, borrowed from Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Linguistic scholars propose various origins: some point to ancient Gallic words for \"neighbor,\" others to the Germanic \"ger\" spear, while certain experts connect it to Old Irish \"garim,\" suggesting a reference to vocal characteristics.\n\nHistorical documentation from 98 CE, specifically Tacitus's \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" presents the Germanic peoples as indigenous inhabitants, suggesting minimal external influence through migration or cultural exchange. Tacitus emphasized the region's forbidding nature, questioning why anyone would choose such harsh terrain over Mediterranean comforts unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nRoman interaction with Germania remained primarily commercial and military in nature. While the Empire conducted periodic campaigns into Germanic territories, permanent settlement proved rare. Germanic tribes, emerging prominently during the first century, maintained a complex relationship with Rome, engaging in trade and occasionally serving in Roman military units while preserving their independence along the Empire's frontiers.",
            "Shakespeare's masterpiece Twelfth Night explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The ultimate dilemma emerges when one must choose between maintaining their true identity and preserving social bonds, as revelations of deceit often strain relationships beyond repair.\n\nThe narrative particularly scrutinizes gender-based deception, raising fundamental questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine attire represents a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, yet this choice isolates her from feminine companionship.\n\nThis calculated deception produces unforeseen complications. Viola's convincing male persona captivates Olivia, leading to a case of mistaken identity with her brother Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Additionally, her disguise complicates her growing attachment to Orsino, who laments: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nContemporary interpretations might view the play as an examination of how artifice can unveil latent desires, particularly regarding Olivia and Orsino's reactions. Their responses to Viola/Cesario potentially suggest unexplored aspects of their own identities. However, Shakespeare likely intended Olivia's character as a satirical commentary on superficial attraction rather than an exploration of sexual fluidity. This interpretation gains credence through her seamless transfer of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola in a familial context: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The historical record shows varying perspectives on colonial administration across different territories. While instances of severe mistreatment occurred, particularly in German South West Africa against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples, the broader picture reveals a complex tapestry of administrative approaches. Educational initiatives, for instance, demonstrated remarkable variation across regions under German authority.\n\nPost-World War I assessments by British administrators in former German East Africa (Tanganyika) revealed an unexpected discovery: a substantial population of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar positive reports emerged regarding educational achievements in Kamerun and other territories. However, the narrative shifts dramatically when examining South West Africa, known today as Namibia.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational framework established in East Africa, South West African educational development relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal governmental assistance. Conversely, European residents benefited from substantial educational investment, including state-funded schools and enhanced support for religious educational institutions. These disparate approaches created lasting implications. While other territories produced numerous educated indigenous populations, South West Africa's native inhabitants largely remained without access to formal education.\n\nRecent scholarship has explored the underlying causes of this educational disparity, particularly examining newly available evidence regarding settler attitudes and administrative policies. The academic literature, predominantly German-language sources from the early 1900s, initially focused on descriptive accounts of colonial educational systems. Subsequent English-language research has provided comparative analyses and deeper exploration of specific educational aspects across different territories.\n\nCohen's influential research comparing South West African and East African education suggests that demographic factors, particularly the size of the European settler population, significantly influenced educational policy development. South West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its substantial desert regions, attracted a larger European presence. By 1913, the territory hosted nearly 15,000 European settlers, almost triple the number in East Africa, its closest competitor in terms of settler population.",
            "During the mid-19th century, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that persisted for nearly six decades, spanning from 1836 to 1893. This period of strained relations culminated in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in Mexico's defeat and the subsequent American acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Numerous confrontations continued until the early 1900s, with conflicts rooted in fundamental differences regarding faith, societal values, and economic interests.\n\nSuch neighboring-state conflicts are not uncommon in global history. Countries sharing geographical boundaries frequently encounter competing interests that foster antagonistic relationships. Cuba and Mexico stand out as particularly notable examples of nations that have experienced prolonged diplomatic challenges with the United States, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained positive relationships with their northern neighbor.\n\nCultural and spiritual differences played a crucial role in this historical tension. The American Protestant establishment harbored deep suspicions toward Catholic institutions, much as later generations would view political ideologies like fascism and communism with distrust. This religious divide echoed earlier Anglo-Spanish rivalries, with both nations inheriting their predecessors' mutual suspicion.\n\nHistorical records document seventeen distinct confrontations between these nations during their period of rivalry. Most incidents involved cross-border security issues, particularly bandit incursions targeting frontier settlements. These security challenges persisted until both governments implemented stronger military presence along their shared boundary.\n\nThe antagonistic relationship gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic ties with the United States. By the century's end, American interests had shifted from territorial expansion to commercial investment, fundamentally altering the dynamic between these neighboring nations.",
            "In 2008, an unexpected medical condition transformed my life overnight, leaving me incapacitated with a rare disorder I'd never heard of before.\n\nAt that point, I was working in healthcare. The decision to enter this field stemmed from my unstable childhood, seeking the promise of steady employment that everyone assured me existed in medicine. Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I opted for what seemed the safer path.\n\nThe reality hit hard when, at age 46, I found myself alone and financially vulnerable, unable to continue working. Currently, after more than a decade receiving disability benefits, my personal possessions have dwindled to almost nothing. Daily survival remains challenging, constantly threatening my sense of stability and worth. While uncertainty pervades every aspect of my existence, one truth stands out: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. Such crises have a way of revealing our fundamental vulnerability.\n\nLife's challenges, whether minor or major, arrive without warning. Despite careful planning, certain obstacles prove insurmountable without assistance. \n\nWhile I acknowledge the need to reduce dependence on federal programs in America, particularly given their current state of dysfunction, I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community connections rather than pursuing isolation. The image of each household retreating to private bunkers seems counterproductive.\n\nHistorical revisionists often glorify American individualism, but our nation's true foundation rests on community cooperation and resource sharing. Consider the westward expansion: success depended on collective effort, not solitary endeavors.\n\nPrudent preparation remains valuable. My own emergency supplies include medical provisions, water treatment equipment, protective materials, illumination sources, and non-perishable food. Those with appropriate resources should consider sustainable practices like small-scale farming and food preservation, or installing alternative heating methods where feasible.\n\nHowever, the most crucial preparation may be establishing connections within your community.",
            "During the mid-first millennium BCE, an individual emerged who would transform the spiritual landscape of Asia. This figure, later known as the Buddha, established philosophical principles that evolved into what we now recognize as Buddhism, with Theravada representing its most traditional branch. As we examine this ancient belief system, now approaching its 2,500th year, we observe significant transformations from its original form. Consider, for example, contemporary practices in Sri Lanka, where an annual ritual involving the ceremonial cutting of water demonstrates how religious expressions have expanded beyond the founder's original teachings. These evolutionary changes extend beyond mere cultural practices, reaching into fundamental theological principles. The adaptations within Theravada Buddhism, affecting both ordained and lay practitioners, reflect responses to various influences, some originating from within the tradition and others from external sources, with impacts ranging from constructive to destructive.\n\nTo properly analyze these developments, we must establish clear definitions. Influences stemming from Buddhist practitioners themselves, regardless of their status, constitute internal factors. Conversely, pressures from non-Buddhist sources represent external elements. Additionally, we distinguish between antagonistic forces - those aimed at undermining Buddhist communities - and neutral influences that, while not intentionally supportive or harmful, may nonetheless affect the tradition's development.\n\nThe foundational elements of Theravada Buddhism center on several key concepts. Practitioners seek guidance through three primary sources: the Buddha's example, his teachings (Dhamma), and the monastic community (Sangha). The canonical texts, known as the Tripitaka, encompass three distinct collections: discourses (Sutta Pitaka), monastic regulations (Vinaya Pitaka), and philosophical treatises (Abhidhamma Pitaka). Core philosophical principles include the absence of an eternal self (Anatta), the pervasive nature of suffering (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Understanding these concepts is crucial for ending the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and eliminating destructive mental states: craving, aversion, and ignorance. The tradition prescribes ethical guidelines, with lay followers observing five basic precepts prohibiting harmful actions, while monastics follow more extensive regulations. Central to Buddhist thought are the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of life's inherent challenges, identifying attachment as their source, and affirming the possibility of liberation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The impact of cultural dynamics on negotiations cannot be understated, yet we must avoid oversimplification. Cultural frameworks resist simple categorization; they are fluid, multifaceted constructs that defy broad stereotypes. Rather than making sweeping generalizations about national characteristics, successful negotiators focus on understanding how specific cultural elements influence the discussion at hand. When we encounter unfamiliar cultural territories, we inevitably filter our observations through the lens of our own experiences.\n\nTo bridge cultural divides effectively, one must invest time in comprehensive research, from historical context to contemporary social norms. Success lies not in attempting to alter or critique these cultural foundations, but in adapting one's approach to work within established parameters. This becomes particularly crucial when operating from a position of lesser leverage or in unfamiliar territory. Demonstrating genuine respect for local customs and beliefs often serves as a catalyst for overcoming cultural obstacles.\n\nCultural considerations extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its distinct ethos, manifesting in various ways – from workplace scheduling preferences to communication hierarchies. These differences appear in numerous forms: dress requirements, management structures, and even charitable involvement policies. The American corporate landscape exemplifies this diversity, with marked variations not only between organizations but also across geographical locations and urban-suburban divides. While some societies may present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals subtle but significant internal variations.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides crucial insight into cultural motivations. In societies where collective harmony and reputation preservation are paramount, negotiators typically avoid actions that might compromise organizational or leadership standing. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may focus more intensely on securing advantageous terms. While these broad cultural patterns merit consideration, developing personal rapport with negotiating counterparts remains essential for optimal outcomes.",
            "In examining religious philosophical discourse, we encounter a fascinating dichotomy between two medieval thinkers' approaches to proving divine existence. The biblical assertion \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" serves as a launching point for both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas in their respective theological arguments. When evaluating their contrasting methodologies, we must operate within the framework of Christian theology, specifically addressing the Judeo-Christian conception of God, rather than entertaining broader theological possibilities.\n\nBoth philosophers, while contributing significantly to theological discourse, fall short of providing an exhaustive foundation for religious belief. Consider Anselm's methodology: he proposes an introspective approach to understanding divinity. His argument centers on the premise that our ability to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence. The core of his reasoning suggests that our cognitive capacity to understand the concept of God necessitates God's existence. This internal, contemplative approach emphasizes personal revelation over external validation.\n\nIn contrast, Aquinas develops a markedly different framework, constructing his argument on empirical foundations. His methodology aligns more closely with scientific reasoning, presenting five distinct logical pathways to prove divine existence. These \"Five Ways\" encompass observations about change, causation, necessity, perfection, and cosmic order. Aquinas's approach mirrors solving a complex equation - each variable leads inevitably to a divine constant. His reasoning suggests that just as one can deduce the properties of an unseen puzzle piece by examining the surrounding pieces and the overall image, one can logically demonstrate God's existence through observable phenomena.",
            "Literary works often employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In examining \"The Great Gatsby,\" one discovers that its creator employs an array of literary devices to achieve particular effects. The narrative occasionally features unconventional pairings of descriptors and objects, creating unique atmospheric qualities. Additionally, the work demonstrates masterful symbolic representation, particularly through its strategic deployment of chromatic imagery. Several hues - including aureate, verdant, alabaster/slate, and crimson/rose - carry significant weight throughout the narrative. The novel constructs deliberate color associations, specifically with ivory/ash and scarlet/blush tones, subsequently utilizing these established meanings to trigger specific emotional responses regarding key elements.\n\nThe ivory/ash spectrum within the text represents conformity, with the former suggesting refinement and social elevation, while the latter implies deterioration and staleness. This symbolic framework emerges early through persistent references. The narrative's socialites consistently appear in pristine attire - from the protagonist's attendance at lavish gatherings in pale garments to various characters' light-colored wardrobes. The sole deviation occurs during the description of elaborate festivities, where vibrant primary colors dominate. This color scheme extends beyond clothing to characterize mundane elements: metropolitan thoroughfares, guest registers, residential complexes - all described in pale or ashen tones. Similarly, ordinary individuals and locations receive these chromatic descriptors: privileged upbringings, industrial wastelands, anonymous immigrants, and aging vendors.\n\nFollowing this established symbolism, the author leverages these shades to denote mundanity or conformity. This technique becomes particularly evident in the portrayal of a central figure, whose repeated association with pale hues gradually transforms her from a distinctive individual into a mere trophy - an object of desire rather than a fully realized character. This chromatic characterization persists throughout pivotal scenes, reinforcing her role as more symbolic than substantial.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under ideal weather conditions, featuring abundant sunshine and temperate seasons. The region's farms yield an impressive array of produce, spanning from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh leafy vegetables and aromatic herbs. Local consumers demonstrate strong support for community-based agriculture, particularly organic operations, with demand frequently exceeding supply. These enterprises often extend beyond mere food production, welcoming visitors for educational tours and outdoor activities.\n\nModern agricultural ventures in this region can leverage various governmental support mechanisms while simultaneously fostering environmental stewardship. Such operations frequently incorporate public engagement through guided experiences and educational initiatives, creating multiple revenue streams.\n\nThe transition to organic farming practices presents both opportunities and challenges. While these methods promote ecological diversity and environmental health through chemical-free cultivation, they demand significant investments in labor and expertise. Farmers must navigate increased operational costs, from manual pest control to natural soil enrichment strategies. Additional conservation efforts, such as implementing rotational grazing systems and maintaining specific habitat conditions, further compound these expenses.\n\nThe case study focuses on a 160-acre property bordering Potrero, California, adjacent to Cleveland National Forest. This diverse landscape encompasses chaparral, introduced Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodlands, falling within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone. The area falls under the jurisdiction of San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which monitors numerous threatened species including the Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher.\n\nHistorical records indicate indigenous occupation spanning millennia, followed by nineteenth-century settlement by ranchers and wood merchants. The land's heritage as a homestead suggests a history of pastoral and timber activities. This analysis employed current real estate listings and available conservation programs to evaluate viable strategies for sustainable agricultural operations, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection - one that transcends ordinary relationships. This special bond encompasses numerous emotional facets: affection, admiration, competition, and sometimes even malice. No one comprehends a sibling quite like another sibling, as they function almost like mirrors to one another. Crisis situations often reveal the true essence of these relationships, whether positive or negative. However, these revelations frequently come at significant personal cost. Understanding sibling dynamics means accepting responsibility for the outcomes they generate. When siblings observe each other, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than their public personas. Their genuine character emerges through their choices and subsequent results.\n\nIn analyzing \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" we witness this dynamic between two siblings navigating their complex relationship. Set against a richly detailed Southern backdrop, their story unfolds as an exercise in futility. The narrative culminates in a tragic scene where pride collides with devastating failure, resulting in a single survivor. The author conveys these themes through careful development of the older brother's character, the siblings' interactions, and first-person narration that reveals the protagonist's internal struggles and worldview - elements that significantly influence the story's trajectory.\n\nThe older brother's motivations stem primarily from his overwhelming pride. From his initial interactions with his younger brother Doodle through their final tragic encounter, he harbors complicated feelings about his sibling's limitations. He had envisioned teaching a brother various physical activities - swimming, climbing, and exploring the local wilderness. He longed for a companion to share adventures with, someone who could match his physical capabilities. These aspirations proved impossible given Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival. Physical exertion posed a significant risk to Doodle's health, crushing his brother's expectations. The protagonist's disappointment manifests darkly - he even contemplates infanticide at one point, revealing disturbing psychological depths. Yet Doodle's innocent smile transforms their relationship, suggesting that beneath the protagonist's pride lies genuine fraternal affection.",
            "Our cognitive apparatus - the mind - functions as an intricate system that processes and interprets information in remarkable ways. Throughout history, scholars have drawn various parallels to explain its operation, evolving from simple analogies like wax tablets to more sophisticated comparisons with modern computing systems. However, we must exercise caution with such comparisons, as they often fall short of capturing the mind's true complexity.\n\nThe journey of information through our neural pathways begins when our sense organs convert physical phenomena - whether tactile sensations, thermal energy, acoustic waves, or light particles - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through parallel processing streams. Consider viewing a geometric shape: elementary processing identifies basic attributes like hue and edges, while higher-order processing integrates this data with existing knowledge to facilitate rapid recognition.\n\nSelective attention mechanisms act as gatekeepers, determining which signals merit further cognitive resources. While countless sensory inputs bombard us continuously, these mechanisms filter out non-essential information. This explains why we might overlook mundane details like individual grass blades beneath our feet, yet instantly recognize our name in crowded, noisy environments. This filtering process occurs continuously across multiple processing stages.\n\nInformation storage occurs across several memory systems, including immediate sensory registers, temporary working memory, and permanent long-term storage. The encoding process varies by sensory modality. Take linguistic information: it can be encoded based on visual appearance, phonetic properties, or meaning. Research with various species suggests that working memory - which spans approximately twenty seconds - relies on reverberating neural circuits, while long-term storage likely involves protein structure modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks to explain knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurobiology. One prominent theory suggests that knowledge exists as interconnected conceptual nodes. Within this framework, related concepts form associative networks - for instance, linking furniture items like chairs and tables with their common properties, such as being wooden.",
            "The global economic landscape underwent a seismic shift during 2007 when a devastating financial catastrophe engulfed the United States. As unemployment figures soared and real estate values plummeted, numerous prominent financial institutions faced unprecedented challenges. This economic downturn continues to reverberate through our society, prompting critical examination of its origins and potential preventive measures for the future.\n\nThe catalyst for this economic tsunami can be traced to misguided regulatory decisions and institutional practices. Financial entities faced mounting pressure to distribute high-risk loans within an inadequately prepared market infrastructure. Subsequently, major government-sponsored enterprises like FNMA and FHLMC were compelled to process and restructure these mortgages into complex financial instruments. The eventual default cascade triggered a chain reaction, depleting bank reserves and contaminating the broader economic ecosystem.\n\nThe groundwork for this crisis emerged during the late 1990s under President Clinton's administration. Seeking to bolster public approval, his government implemented more lenient lending policies. Contemporary reporting by the New York Times' Steven Holmes highlighted FNMA's predicament, noting increased governmental pressure to expand credit accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes presciently warned about potential consequences during economic downturns, drawing parallels to previous financial sector interventions.\n\nMultiple elements converged to create this perfect storm, including revolutionary mortgage products. The widespread adoption of variable-rate mortgages and sophisticated debt instruments created unprecedented interconnections within the economy. This heightened exposure to real estate market fluctuations left both households and financial markets particularly vulnerable to market corrections.\n\nWhen housing prices eventually declined, institutions holding mortgage-backed securities faced severe consequences. Major investment banks collectively reported mortgage obligations exceeding $4.1 trillion by 2007, representing nearly one-third of America's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of several prestigious financial institutions, while government-sponsored enterprises, carrying $5 trillion in mortgage debt, required federal intervention by late 2008.",
            "Let's discuss the pitfalls of exposition in storytelling. While it might seem tempting to unleash a torrent of background information, this approach often backfires spectacularly. Even experienced writers sometimes catch themselves drowning their readers in unnecessary details, prompting frustrated responses from their audience.\n\nRemember: exposition should be your servant, not your master.\n\nWriters frequently encounter the age-old advice to \"show, don't tell,\" yet many of us - myself included - occasionally fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs, or conversely, too much happens at once. It's like having two competing voices in your head: one urging you to quickly dispense with background information, the other insisting that every minute detail of every character's past must be shared.\n\nIn its simplest form, exposition delivers information directly to the audience. Consider how movies often handle this through dialogue between characters, with one person conveniently explaining everything to another. In written narratives, the author assumes this role.\n\nConsider this scenario: A story briefly mentions that two characters met, married, and tragically parted through death - all within a couple of pages and minimal dialogue. This approach does a disservice to the narrative. Instead, readers deserve to witness the husband's character through his actions and words, to understand why the heroine fell in love, and to feel the depth of their connection. This investment makes readers genuine participants in the heroine's grief, creating a deeper emotional resonance.\n\nThe difference lies between stating \"They met, married, and parted\" and crafting a living, breathing narrative.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to dump information, even when introducing new characters. Yes, that gas station night manager might be an ex-Air Force veteran with two marriages behind him who enjoys fishing and harbors dreams of ownership - but these details deserve to emerge naturally, not in one overwhelming burst.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable broadcasts on NBC 4. The morning programming began with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended an individual following an assault on his spouse involving multiple stab wounds. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nSubsequently, the broadcast covered an incident involving an 18-year-old shooting victim in the Sharon Woods district. The victim sustained critical injuries, and law enforcement, including SWAT personnel, were actively investigating with no suspects identified. The abbreviated coverage of this incident raised questions about potential media bias in crime reporting across different demographic groups.\n\nThe broadcast then addressed an aviation security concern involving a Med-Flight helicopter that sustained damage from what investigators determined to be a .22 caliber rifle round. Authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to an arrest.\n\nWeather coverage followed, highlighting anticipated precipitation and electrical storms for the weekend, with temperature forecasts remaining consistent in the 80-85°F range. This segment appeared deliberately concise to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe news team then reported on a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, providing detailed physical descriptions of the suspect. The emphasis placed on certain aspects of the suspect's appearance seemed disproportionate to the story's context.\n\nThe final segment covered a narcotics trafficking case involving an individual convicted of marijuana distribution between Texas and Ohio. The reporting included an unusual presentation of the sentence duration in months rather than years, and included demographic details that appeared superfluous to the core story.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with the trading flexibility of common stocks. These investment vehicles mirror specific indices, commodities, or asset groups while offering enhanced liquidity through exchange-based trading. Market participants can leverage ETF shares similarly to individual stocks, including options for short selling, margin trading, and fractional share purchases.\n\nThe financial advantages of ETFs extend beyond their operational flexibility. These instruments typically maintain significantly reduced expense ratios compared to conventional mutual funds, although investors should note that brokerage commissions apply to ETF transactions. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across various sectors and investment strategies.\n\nHowever, prudent investors should conduct thorough due diligence regarding marketed advantages such as portfolio diversification. This investigation focuses on analyzing the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF) in comparison to its principal components. The research aims to determine whether holding the ETF provides comparable benefits to maintaining discrete positions in its primary constituents, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns.\n\nMethodologically, this analysis concentrates on the fund's top ten holdings, which collectively represent 63.58% of total assets, as examining all components would prove impractical. To assess how effectively these primary positions reflect the complete fund's characteristics, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the corresponding portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns.\n\nThe computational results reveal intriguing disparities: a hypothetical portfolio comprising solely the top ten holdings demonstrates a return premium of 6.11% (representing a 16% performance differential) while maintaining a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. These preliminary findings suggest the potential superiority of a concentrated portfolio strategy. Nevertheless, further statistical analysis becomes necessary to determine whether these performance differentials maintain statistical significance.\n\nTo facilitate this statistical evaluation, we calculated and normalized the standard deviations for each component security to enable meaningful comparison with the aggregate fund's volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of the participation data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a concerning decline in commuter log entries during the project's third month. Multiple factors potentially contributed to this downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our northeastern institution naturally discouraged both cycling and pedestrian commuting. The academic calendar also played a significant role, as December brings final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties that consume the campus community's attention. Moreover, the extended winter break means many community members are absent from campus entirely.\n\nWhile these factors partially explain the December and January participation rates, the February numbers remain puzzling. One theory suggests that such initiatives often experience natural enthusiasm cycles, with initial excitement giving way to reduced engagement over time. Our response was to implement a focused \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, which successfully boosted participation rates. This experience highlighted two key operational challenges: maintaining momentum despite natural engagement cycles and adapting to academic calendar disruptions.\n\nThe project also confronted deeply ingrained cultural preferences for personal vehicle use, which offers unmatched convenience and autonomy. To counter this, we implemented an incentive structure featuring gift certificates to various local establishments, including dining venues, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating escalating prize values throughout the project timeline might have better sustained participation. For instance, introducing high-value rewards like premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles during later project phases could have prevented the observed engagement decline. While our initial incentives proved adequate for launch, a graduated reward system featuring increasingly substantial prizes might have better maintained community interest and participation levels throughout the project duration.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, specifically analyzing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces showcase innovative editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unique deviations in these early cinematic works.\n\nThe majority of these productions adhered to specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a theater-style presentation, maintained stationary camera positions, employed broader viewing angles, and typically contained just one continuous scene. However, some pioneering works from the early 1900s began challenging these established norms by incorporating multiple scenes.\n\nA striking characteristic shared among these productions was their theatrical staging. The camera remained fixed, similar to an audience member's perspective in a theater, never following the performers' movements. This approach clearly drew inspiration from stage performances, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts. This setup naturally constrained performer movement to lateral directions, as demonstrated in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors traverse the screen horizontally rather than approaching or retreating from the viewing perspective.\n\nThe theatrical influence extended to shot composition as well. Directors favored wide and occasional medium-range shots, completely avoiding close-ups throughout this period. This mirrored the theatrical experience where audiences simultaneously view the entire stage performance. The performers maintained their distance from the camera, preserving this theatrical perspective.\n\nThese productions typically consisted of what appeared to be single, continuous takes, usually running under sixty seconds. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, resulting in brief, vaudeville-style demonstrations focusing on magical effects rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that what viewers perceived as single shots often involved multiple cleverly merged segments. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate footage segments merge to create the illusion.",
            "Literary scholars often note that Gothic fiction represents a fascinating paradox: simultaneously embracing antiquity and modernity. This duality manifests in both its nomenclature and essence, as noted in Ian Watt's scholarly examination of the genre's emergence. Throughout its evolution, the Gothic literary movement has experienced dramatic shifts in critical reception, with some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nWhen Horace Walpole introduced The Castle of Otranto, widely acknowledged as the genre's cornerstone, he deliberately merged classical romantic elements with contemporary narrative techniques. His innovative approach, which he dubbed \"A Gothic Story,\" synthesized theatrical conventions from earlier periods with realistic character portrayals typical of contemporary fiction. The term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations, referring variously to historical periods, architectural styles, and cultural movements. During Walpole's era, many viewed gothic elements as primitive compared to contemporary literary developments. However, this unique fusion of theatrical gothic elements with novel-length psychological exploration has granted the genre remarkable staying power, allowing it to feel simultaneously historical and contemporary to readers across generations.\n\nThe medieval concept of chivalry emerges as a central theme in Gothic literature, particularly evident in The Castle of Otranto. This focus on chivalric ideals reflects contemporary anxieties about moral decay in society. Writing during politically turbulent times, Walpole appeared to view the medieval period as a moral golden age, contrasting sharply with what he perceived as the degradation of his era. This perspective manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. As a prince who has endured significant hardship and is believed to have fallen to infidels, Frederic exemplifies the archetypal \"gallant and courteous Knight\" - though his characterization ventures into hyperbole, establishing what would become a hallmark of Gothic excess.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept emerged in 1982, credited to consultant Keith Oliver, who articulated it as a comprehensive methodology for orchestrating and supervising supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements efficiently.\n\nAt its core, supply chain management rests on six fundamental pillars: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock control, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodologies for product creation. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the primary barometer of consumer demands. This market intelligence guides decisions about product selection and volume requirements. Subsequently, facility selection occurs, with emphasis on optimizing production capacity and quality standards while ensuring customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce manufacturing sites are determined, attention shifts to workflow coordination and equipment upkeep. The manufacturing phase demands meticulous attention to detail, as oversights can result in significant financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nResource procurement, the second pillar, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Organizations often maintain multiple production units for single items, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize process allocation across these units or potentially engage external partners. The primary motivation for outsourcing stems from the pursuit of velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while achieving or preserving cost efficiency.",
            "Literature from the Victorian era typically showcases meticulous descriptive elements and predominantly centers on upper-class society. However, two notable exceptions to this pattern emerge in the form of \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" These works diverge from conventional Victorian literature by incorporating mysterious elements and unusual narrative approaches, which serve to enhance character development and provide deeper insights into their psychological states and emotional motivations.\n\nConsider this passage from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth narratives employ dream sequences and hallucinatory states, though each serves distinct purposes. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these surreal episodes illuminate the protagonist's internal struggles and his growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's depiction of Oliver's shooting demonstrates this effectively. Through a dreamlike recollection, Oliver experiences the trauma anew, highlighting his powerlessness in the face of events beyond his control. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore both his physical deterioration and psychological torment. The scene's sensory confusion - where pain becomes a constant rather than an acute sensation - emphasizes his disorientation and vulnerability. This portrayal raises questions about agency and fate, suggesting Oliver's increasing resignation to his circumstances, possibly indicating Fagin's successful manipulation of his spirit. His lack of self-preservation instinct during this critical moment implies a deepening surrender to despair.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my tenure as an elementary school tutor, I encountered a memorable case that highlighted a significant educational challenge. The student, Adrian, appeared to be a native English speaker despite his Hispanic background, yet he demonstrated unusual difficulties with reading. His letter recognition pattern was inconsistent - some perfectly clear, others completely foreign to him.\n\nThe breakthrough came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's primary exposure to written language had been through Spanish alphabet conventions. While verbally fluent in English, he struggled with the fundamentals of English orthography.\n\nThis experience illuminates a broader issue within our educational system, particularly in California's diverse linguistic landscape. The challenge extends beyond obvious language barriers - even students who appear fully assimilated may face hidden obstacles in literacy acquisition. The solution requires a multi-faceted approach combining various methodologies: dual-language instruction, immersion programs, individualized tutoring, and structured ESL support.\n\nResearch demonstrates that dual-language education yields superior academic outcomes across all student populations. Despite concerns about resource allocation, implementing comprehensive bilingual programs benefits both native English speakers and language learners. While universal teacher bilingualism remains impractical, incorporating specialized bilingual support staff offers a viable solution for creating inclusive learning environments.",
            "Throughout human history, people have grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. Different cultures address this through various institutions: churches, synagogues, or personal meditation. While many individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions without question, others staunchly reject any notion of supernatural forces, choosing instead to view existence through a purely individualistic lens. Our spiritual journeys often evolve, with beliefs shifting and transforming as we mature. Each person's quest for meaning represents a unique expedition through life's mysteries, as we all seek illumination amid life's uncertainties.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, I shared a quiet moment with my father on our home's veranda. \"Cardinals are my favorite,\" he responded when I inquired about birds. The rainfall created a rhythmic symphony against the metal roofing while we shared a smoke. Overflowing gutters drenched the garden below. His gaze wandered distantly across the landscape, his frame noticeably diminished from illness. His once-full head of hair had thinned considerably. Words about our impending separation remained unspoken, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, I simply moved closer, and together we observed the summer shower as dusk approached.\n\nThat winter, shortly after I turned twenty-two, my father succumbed to his illness. Despite aggressive medical interventions extending his life beyond predictions, I questioned their purpose given his prolonged suffering. My faith wavered; the concept of a benevolent deity seemed impossible in the face of such cruelty. During sleepless nights, prayer felt futile - as if any divine presence had long since abandoned me.\n\nI made a conscious choice to avoid witnessing his final moments. As his only offspring, I understood him profoundly enough to know he wouldn't want me present for that culminating scene. I preferred preserving memories of his vitality rather than his decline. Isolated in my bedroom, I spent three days awaiting inevitable news.\n\nThe notification never came through any phone call.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideals, the agriculturalist and political figure John Taylor of Caroline stands prominent. His agricultural background, combined with his political endeavors, shaped him into a passionate defender of individual liberties and limited governance. Agricultural principles fundamentally influenced his perspectives on governmental matters, from constitutional interpretation to judicial philosophy, as he sought to protect what he viewed as humanity's noblest profession.\n\nTaylor recognized America's unique position to establish an unprecedented governmental framework, unfettered by historical precedents. He emphasized the interconnected nature of fundamental human rights, arguing that these liberties formed an inseparable whole - compromise one, and the entire structure would eventually collapse. In his view, civilization must transcend the primitive \"state of nature\" where physical strength and cunning dominated, instead establishing protections for all citizens.\n\nThe establishment of an effective society, Taylor maintained, required governmental structures acknowledging humanity's moral complexity. His framework recognized both virtuous and corrupt human tendencies, asserting that \"governmental characteristics mirror human nature.\" He championed policies protecting private property and agricultural development while opposing capitalistic excess. Taylor acknowledged self-interest as a universal human motivator but distinguished between its constructive and destructive manifestations.\n\nRegarding constitutional matters, Taylor aligned with contemporary Republican thought, advocating strict constitutional interpretation. He favored severely limited federal authority, restricting it to explicitly granted powers. While supporting literal constitutional reading, he emphasized the importance of understanding the founders' original intent. Notably, Taylor elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more explicit affirmation of state sovereignty over national unity.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, taking in the scene before me with clinical detachment. Like a scientist observing a specimen, I processed the visual information without emotional investment, my thoughts flowing like water through a sieve – present one moment, gone the next.\n\nI recalled a time when I had pursued artistic endeavors. Following a colleague's suggestion, I had invested in Betty Edwards' renowned instructional text on drawing. The book's methodology included a fascinating technique of frame isolation – reducing complex scenes to manageable segments for artistic interpretation. This approach transformed overwhelming panoramas into digestible visual elements.\n\nBut in this moment, no artistic framework could contain what lay before me. The sight commanded my full attention, demanding acknowledgment in its raw authenticity. While the great masters had their signature palettes – Picasso's blues, Monet's verdant landscapes – here was my own peculiar canvas, a monochromatic study in earthen hues.\n\nI reached for my tool with practiced precision, my movements deliberate and measured. The porcelain throne before me held its unwanted offering, resistant to the rushing waters I summoned. Each pull of the handle sent crystalline streams swirling, yet the stubborn mass remained unmoved, anchored like barnacles to a ship's hull.\n\nThere I stood in my retail uniform, complete with regulation green necktie, contemplating this unexpected challenge in the Rite Aid restroom. After several unsuccessful attempts at hydraulic persuasion, I resorted to more direct measures. Methodically wrapping my hand in protective layers of tissue, I steeled myself for the task ahead. With the determination of someone reaching into an oven to retrieve a well-done roast, I extended my hand toward the bowl's depths...",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among adolescent drivers demands our immediate attention. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, demonstrates that neurological development in adolescents remains insufficient for handling the complexities of operating motor vehicles. The combination of underdeveloped decision-making capabilities and limited driving experience creates a perfect storm of risk factors.\n\nStudies conducted by various research organizations highlight a disturbing correlation between passenger age demographics and collision frequency. This data becomes particularly relevant when considering the social patterns of young drivers, who frequently transport their peers.\n\nWhile various jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing programs to mitigate these risks, such measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem persists: physiologically and psychologically, young drivers consistently demonstrate inadequate capacity for managing automotive responsibilities.\n\nDistinguished psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research, as reported in USA Today, indicates that risk-seeking behavior peaks during late adolescence, suggesting that even 18-year-olds may lack the maturity necessary for safe driving. This propensity for thrill-seeking, combined with the projected surge in eligible young drivers as children of Baby Boomers reach driving age, portends a potentially catastrophic increase in roadway fatalities.\n\nA practical solution exists through comprehensive federal legislation. Educational institutions could maintain their driver education programs, but actual licensure would be restricted to individuals 18 and older. The existing framework of provisional permits and supervised training requirements could remain intact, utilizing current state-mandated guidelines for practical experience. For instance, jurisdictions like California already mandate specific training requirements: 6 hours of professional instruction plus 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven that mortality statistics among young drivers remain consistent across state lines, implementing uniform national standards represents a logical approach to addressing this critical public safety concern. This proposed regulatory framework builds upon existing precedents rather than introducing radical changes.",
            "An Overview of Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nThe following discussion examines Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) through three distinct lenses: its fundamental definition, diagnostic procedures, and classroom accommodations for affected students.\n\nCAPD, alternatively known as APD, represents a unique neurological condition affecting auditory information processing. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's 2005 guidelines, this disorder impacts how effectively the brain processes acoustic signals. Interestingly, individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing capabilities but struggle with the brain's interpretation of auditory input, such as distinguishing specific voices amid background noise or processing verbal communications effectively.\n\nThe historical trajectory of CAPD research began during the 1950s, when scientists initially labeled the condition \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking developments emerged through Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari's pioneering assessment methods in 1954. Subsequently, Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961 revolutionized our understanding of auditory processing pathways. A pivotal 1977 conference catalyzed extensive research initiatives focusing on pediatric CAPD cases.\n\nCAPD's symptom profile encompasses various challenges: spatial sound orientation difficulties, problems distinguishing between concurrent sounds, pattern recognition deficits, inability to detect vocal nuances (including emotional undertones), auditory masking issues, difficulties synthesizing acoustic information, and challenges with sequential auditory processing.\n\nDiagnostic procedures typically involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by multidisciplinary teams, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments incorporate behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory testing protocols. Currently, no singular diagnostic tool definitively identifies CAPD, and its etiology remains unclear. Contemporary evaluation methods often utilize dichotic listening tasks and sophisticated acoustic response measurements to assess auditory processing capabilities.",
            "My aspiration to join the Division of Family and Children Services stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for vulnerable youth and support families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with personal challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping mechanisms. These observations guided me toward completing my Psychology degree at Piedmont College in 2009. Following graduation, I took time to reflect on my career direction. A pivotal moment occurred when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse at a friend's home. The subsequent day brought news of police involvement at his family residence. Drawing upon my psychology background, I offered assistance at the scene. When law enforcement requested my help in communicating with the parents, their defensive responses and dismissive attitude toward serious family conflicts solidified my resolve to pursue social work.\n\nThe principle of social justice particularly resonates with my worldview. Contemporary society presents a paradox: while claiming to value individuality, it often promotes conformity. My personal journey reflects a consistent challenge to societal norms and prejudices. Throughout my academic career, I actively demonstrated my commitment to social justice through various forms of self-expression and advocacy. This included supporting LGBTQ+ rights through GSBA participation, confronting racial discrimination, and expressing individuality through personal appearance choices. My dedication to promoting social justice remains unwavering and will continue to inform my professional practice.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through two distinct frameworks: the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives. While biological approaches emphasize hereditary factors and physiological mechanisms, sociocultural analyses concentrate on environmental influences, including demographic variables and cultural contexts. This examination delves into both paradigms, presenting relevant research and evaluating their respective merits and limitations.\n\nSleep disturbances manifest in various categories: they may exist independently, emerge alongside other psychological conditions, or stem from external factors. Independent sleep disorders encompass two main groups: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The former includes conditions like Primary Insomnia, Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and several others, while Parasomnias encompass disorders such as night terrors and sleepwalking. When these disturbances coincide with other psychological conditions, they're typically associated with either Clinical or Personality Disorders.\n\nFrom a biological standpoint, research has illuminated fascinating neurological mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Scientists have identified crucial neurons within the hypothalamus that contain orexin, which plays a vital role in sleep-wake cycles. Recent studies involving laboratory mice have revealed that GABAB receptors on these neurons significantly influence sleep patterns. When researchers activated specific receptors using baclofen (a GABAB agonist), they observed increased sleep duration. These findings suggest potential therapeutic approaches for sleep disorders, though more research is needed to fully understand their implications for human subjects. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, potentially affecting their academic performance, professional life, and overall well-being.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've gained considerable insight into the transportation challenges that plague our expanding campus. During my initial year, my residence in Stuart Hall, situated in East Halls, positioned me at what felt like the campus periphery. The journey to central locations like Willard Building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nAn interesting conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast empty spaces. Today, those areas have transformed into athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, plus numerous residential developments. This expansion, while beneficial for the university's growth, has intensified transportation difficulties.\n\nIn contemplating solutions to this mobility challenge, one option stands paramount: cycling. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after abandoning it for several years. Their enthusiasm was palpable as they declared cycling's superiority for campus navigation, despite its temporary decline in popularity. Beyond its health advantages, cycling represents the most energy-efficient transportation method available - a simple breakfast can fuel considerable distance.\n\nNow residing off-campus at a distance comparable to some university housing, I've discovered that cycling has revolutionized my daily routine. The trek to Thomas Building, typically requiring 25 minutes by foot, now takes merely 5 minutes with vigorous pedaling. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking maintains its merits, my packed schedule necessitates faster transportation. The time savings are substantial - cycling eliminates roughly 150 minutes of walking weekly, considering just one daily class commute. Factor in additional campus movements, and the temporal benefits become even more significant.",
            "In his masterwork Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a disturbing future society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes personal autonomy, and the pursuit of pleasure has become life's primary directive. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere components in an elaborate social machine.\n\nA close reading through Marxist interpretation reveals profound commentary on societal control mechanisms. The text demonstrates multiple parallels with Marxist concepts, particularly regarding social homogenization and the transformation of human experience into commodity. These elements suggest Huxley's deep-seated concerns about the direction of modern economic systems.\n\nThe novel's society exemplifies what Marx termed \"false consciousness,\" where populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. This manifests clearly in the rigid caste system, where lower classes (Deltas, Gammas) are programmed through sleep-learning to embrace consumerist behaviors and their predetermined social roles. The World Controller orchestrates this grand deception, wielding complete authority over the populace's thoughts and desires.\n\nSocial interactions in this society lack genuine emotional depth. Characters appear as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals, suggesting the dehumanizing effects of technological determinism and market forces. Meaningful connections are absent; instead, relationships remain shallow, with men viewing women primarily as objects of pleasure (\"pneumatic\"), while women discuss intimate encounters with clinical detachment. Each social stratum's acceptance of their position reflects Marx's observations about how capitalism maintains control through false consciousness, with individuals believing in their own fulfillment while serving merely as cogs in the consumer machine.\n\nThe class structure's rigid maintenance through psychological conditioning demonstrates how power systems perpetuate themselves by creating willing participants in their own subjugation. The lower classes remain blissfully unaware of their manipulation, while most upper-class citizens (Alphas and Betas) choose comfortable compliance over questioning the status quo.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that sparked an ongoing intellectual curiosity about religious tolerance in contemporary society. The discourse surrounding Islam, particularly in the post-9/11 era, has undergone a remarkable transformation. We've witnessed a pendulum swing from initial skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation, exemplified by the historic presidency of Barack Obama, whose family heritage includes Islamic influences.\n\nThe historical accounts of Muhammad's life present fascinating contradictions that warrant scholarly examination. Traditional narratives often portray him as a military strategist who expanded his influence through conquest, yet biographical sources paint a markedly different picture - one of a misunderstood spiritual leader whose followers gathered voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nWhat strikes me as particularly noteworthy are the parallels between Islamic and Christian religious narratives. Consider, for instance, the account of Muhammad multiplying food for forty individuals, which bears striking resemblance to Christian miracle accounts. These similarities raise important questions about the transmission and adaptation of religious narratives across cultural boundaries, and perhaps suggest an attempt to establish legitimacy through familiar motifs.\n\nThe biographical sources rely heavily on chains of oral transmission, a common practice in ancient historical documentation. While this methodology aimed to establish credibility through multiple attestation, modern historical criticism might question the reliability of such extensively mediated accounts.\n\nThe disparity between historical records and religious biographical accounts creates a challenging dichotomy. While religious texts present Muhammad as an exemplar of humility and wisdom, historical evidence suggests a more complex figure who wielded considerable political and military authority. This raises important questions about historical accuracy versus religious interpretation in sacred biographical literature.",
            "Historical analysis reveals that the original message of Christ became increasingly diluted as Christian theology evolved post-crucifixion. Examining this progression chronologically demonstrates an expanding divergence from initial principles. Contemporary society exhibits mounting intellectual curiosity and unprecedented liberal inclinations, though conservative elements persist in maintaining traditional interpretations. These traditionalists, while vocal, may lack sufficient numbers to shape broader societal directions.\n\nFuture decades will likely witness an expanding historical consciousness among Christian adherents, accompanied by an intensifying desire to separate subsequent theological additions from Jesus's fundamental teachings. This transformation, though potentially spanning generations or centuries, appears inevitable: Christian theology will undergo a remarkable reversal, gradually shedding accumulated doctrinal layers until reaching its foundational essence - Christ's original divine message.\n\nAs this movement gains momentum across Western nations, inspiring multitudes to embrace first-century worship practices, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their leadership role. Paradoxically, this theological retrospection will likely reduce denominational fragmentation, fostering increased uniformity in belief systems and religious practices. Historical precedent supports such dramatic reversals - consider Rome's transformation from Christian persecutor to Christian empire, or America's evolution from slave-holding nation to one embracing diverse leadership.\n\nThis impending theological reformation will largely depend upon interpreting Christ's teachings metaphorically rather than literally. But to comprehend this progression, we must examine Christianity's roots in Judaism. Prior to Rome's occupation of Jerusalem (63 BCE), Judaism had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority. Yet even then, Jewish society exhibited internal divisions among Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through my analysis of The Jungle, it becomes evident that humanity's inherent nature tends toward self-interest and avarice. The narrative demonstrates how individuals prioritize their personal advancement while disregarding those beneath them in social standing. This theme manifests particularly strongly in Sinclair's portrayal of industrial leadership.\n\nThe corporate executives and facility administrators exemplify this behavior through their relentless pursuit of expansion and profit. Their actions demonstrate complete indifference to collateral damage, whether environmental or human. As Sinclair illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery powerfully conveys the environmental devastation wrought by industrial negligence. The administration's apathy extends to the toxic emissions from their facilities and the biological waste from countless animal enclosures surrounding Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation extends deeply into labor practices. As one passage notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers faced arbitrary dismissal, hazardous conditions, and excessive hours without recourse. The absence of regulatory oversight during this period enabled widespread abuse. While not explicitly stated, residents of Packingtown were expected to endure both occupational and environmental hazards without complaint. Support systems were notably absent, and even labor unions often exploited rather than protected workers. Sinclair draws a powerful parallel to slavery, noting that \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Among the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, \"Dream-land\" stands as a notable composition that the author himself held in high regard. The poem contains references to \"Thulé,\" appearing at both its beginning and end. While scholars traditionally connect this term to Virgil's description of a mysterious northern island beyond Britain's shores, contemporary research suggests an alternative inspiration.\n\nThe German literary sphere, particularly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's contributions, offers compelling connections. A fascinating parallel emerges between Poe's work and Goethe's masterpiece \"Faust,\" completed in two segments (1808 and 1832). Within \"Faust Part Two\" lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poignant narrative about a bereaved monarch who, after receiving a goblet from his dying queen, succumbs to grief and alcohol before a dramatic seaside death.\n\nThe thematic resonance between these works is striking. Both \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" explore themes of isolation, loss, and darkness. Poe's narrator traverses a colorless realm populated by spectral memories, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's king. This parallel becomes more significant considering Poe's documented appreciation for German literature and his connection to Tennyson, another Goethe admirer.\n\nThe timing is also noteworthy - H.P. Grattan's 1842 adaptation of \"Faust\" preceded Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by mere months. This temporal proximity, combined with the works' shared motifs, suggests more than coincidental similarity. The evidence points to a deliberate artistic dialogue between these literary pieces, with Poe potentially crafting \"Dream-Land\" as a dark reflection of Goethe's earlier work.",
            "Would California law permit punitive damages in a case where a grocery store patron sustained injuries from slipping on spilled applesauce, given that the store manager deliberately ignored two staff notifications about the hazard while taking his meal break?\n\nAnalysis indicates the court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed. California statutes permit such damages when defendants exhibit \"oppression, fraud or malice\" in non-contractual matters (Cal. Civ. Code § 3294). The circumstances suggest potential malicious conduct, defined as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" behavior showing conscious disregard for safety.\n\nThe incident occurred at approximately 5:30 PM when Jennifer Palmer encountered the unremediated spill. Documentation shows that two staff members - R. Wayne and M. Haddigan - had separately notified Manager Paul Martin about the hazard at 5:00 PM and 5:15 PM respectively. Martin dismissed both reports, citing his dinner break as justification for inaction.\n\nSeveral factors strengthen the punitive damages argument:\n- The store's history of six similar incidents in 2009 alone\n- Martin's repeated refusal to address a known safety hazard\n- His explicit prioritization of a meal break over customer safety\n- The reasonable foreseeability of injury given past incidents\n\nWhile establishing \"despicable\" conduct presents a higher bar, Martin's pattern of negligence despite multiple prior accidents could satisfy this requirement. The manager's documented responses to staff warnings demonstrate conscious disregard for patron safety, potentially meeting the \"willful and deliberate failure\" standard outlined in Taylor v. Superior Court (1979).\n\nGiven these circumstances, summary dismissal of punitive damages would be inappropriate as sufficient evidence exists to support the claim's key elements under California law.",
            "Throughout her adolescence, an inexplicable yearning persisted within her consciousness. This peculiar sensation first manifested around her fourteenth year and maintained its presence well into her seventeenth. Eventually, the abstract longing crystallized into something more specific - a desire for companionship. Curiously, despite numerous advances from potential suitors, she remained unmoved by their attempts at courtship. This puzzling emotional state became a frequent subject of her introspection, though years of contemplation yielded no satisfactory explanations.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere of her household typically exuded tranquility. Her parents, both even-tempered individuals, rarely engaged in disputes, either with each other or their vivacious daughter. The sole source of tension arose from her assertions of autonomy. Despite inheriting their gentle nature, she possessed an effervescent personality that drew others to her naturally.\n\nHowever, this particular afternoon shattered their usual serenity. While wandering between rooms seeking creative inspiration, she detected an alarming cry emanating from the kitchen - her mother's voice distorted by pain. Rushing to investigate, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, each breath punctuated by expressions of agony. \"Hospital,\" her mother managed between labored breaths, directing her daughter's hands to assist. Years of physical conditioning proved invaluable as she carefully transported her injured mother to their vehicle.\n\nThe clinical environment of the emergency room, with its characteristic antiseptic atmosphere, barely registered in her consciousness as she focused solely on securing medical attention. After calling for assistance, she watched helplessly as healthcare professionals whisked her mother away on a gurney, leaving her alone with her concerns.\n\nThe incident's cause was surprisingly mundane - an unfortunate fall from a stepstool while attempting to retrieve a decorative vessel from an elevated storage space.",
            "Recent research has investigated the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns resembling those of Mediterranean coastal regions. The investigation centered on evaluating whether individuals following an adapted Mediterranean eating pattern, quantified through the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) scoring system, experienced reduced instances of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart disease and stroke-related events.\n\nThe adapted Mediterranean eating pattern emphasizes abundant consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grain products, and protein-rich plant sources. It also promotes the use of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats over saturated alternatives, includes regular fish consumption, and permits moderate alcohol consumption while limiting animal-based products.\n\nEarlier research had demonstrated promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating patterns and decreased overall mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes. Additionally, controlled studies indicated superior outcomes in weight management and cholesterol profiles compared to traditional low-fat dietary approaches among overweight participants. However, specific impacts on stroke occurrence remained unexplored.\n\nThe research team tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals, aged 38-63, participating in the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study across 11 American states. None had pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or diabetes at enrollment. Dietary habits were assessed through validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered six times between 1984 and 2004, maintaining an exceptional 95% participant retention rate. Health outcomes were verified through medical documentation, with some cases (17% of strokes, 24% of non-fatal heart attacks) classified as probable when complete records were unavailable.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of dietary scores and incorporated adjustments for various health-related behaviors and characteristics. Statistical analysis employed Cox proportional-hazard models to evaluate relationships between dietary adherence and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant cardiovascular benefits among participants maintaining higher aMed scores. Throughout the two-decade observation period, researchers documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related fatalities. Statistical analysis showed that participants achieving the highest dietary scores demonstrated a 29% lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A solitary figure emerges from the urban landscape - actress Ellen Page, known for her role in Juno, displays a provocative message on cardboard: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has endured decades of military rule since a 1962 military takeover. In 2007, the country witnessed unprecedented demonstrations, primarily led by Buddhist clergy members wearing their distinctive saffron-colored robes. What began as peaceful assemblies quickly devolved into widespread conflict between religious institutions and government forces. International media faced severe restrictions, culminating in the tragic death of Kenji Nagai, a Japanese photographer, during a demonstration. While official statistics cite merely 13 casualties, a military defector named Colonel Hla Win suggested the actual death count reached thousands.\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout human history. Ancient civilizations often justified authoritarian control through divine mandate - from Roman emperors claiming celestial approval to Japanese monarchs being revered as deities themselves. Modern governance continues to display concerning relationships between political and religious institutions, as exemplified by the interactions between President George W. Bush and religious leader Ted Haggard.\n\nHistorical precedents demonstrate the devastating impact of authoritarian control. The 1989 Tiananmen Square incident resulted in significant casualties, with estimates varying dramatically between government figures (200-300) and Chinese Red Cross reports (2,000-3,000). Similarly, the 1990s Rwandan crisis saw systematic elimination of Tutsi civilians and moderate politicians by Hutu militias with government support. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany's regime represents another instance of state-sponsored persecution, targeting Jewish populations across multiple nations.",
            "The remarkable influence of Duke Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his enduring career and exceptional talent for orchestral composition. While his piano work remains understated in many pieces, his brilliance shines through his ability to craft intricate compositions that brought out the best in each musician. By establishing frameworks that balanced structured orchestration with improvisational freedom, Ellington demonstrated an uncanny ability to harness the unique qualities of individual performers while maintaining cohesive ensemble sound.\n\nThe musical encyclopedia Grove highlights Creole Love Call as a prime example of Ellington's innovative approach to incorporating vocals as instrumental elements. This twelve-bar blues composition unfolds across six distinct choruses, each showcasing different aspects of his orchestration mastery:\n\nInitially, vocals and reeds engage in dialogue, transitioning from smooth to coarse tones. A muted trumpet then takes center stage, expanding upon the core melody with extended blue notes. The third chorus features soaring clarinet work accompanied by delicate piano syncopation. The fourth movement brings the full ensemble into play, with brass and reeds echoing the opening dialogue. The piece reaches its peak in the fifth chorus through high-register reed work against punctuated brass and rhythm. The final chorus mirrors the opening structure before concluding with a brief coda featuring vocal flourishes and unconventional trombone resolution.\n\nThis innovative vocal integration appears throughout Ellington's repertoire, as evidenced in Hot and Bothered, where \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet converses with Baby Cox's scatting, creating an intriguing blend of instrumental and vocal timbres. Similarly, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's distinctive muted trombone introduction, further demonstrating Ellington's gift for leveraging individual talents within his compositions.",
            "What mechanisms drive evolutionary pathways in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the factors that channel evolutionary trajectories, yet our ability to describe biological forms mathematically remains limited - a challenge first noted by D'Arcy Thompson over a century ago. Recent advances have enabled researchers to apply mathematical frameworks to analyze shell formation in mollusks, both during individual development and across evolutionary time scales.\n\nOur research focuses on the genus Prunum, where we combine mathematical modeling with experimental approaches to investigate evolutionary-developmental patterns. By analyzing X-ray images of various Prunum species, we extracted quantitative measurements that were input into CerioShell software to generate both theoretical and actual shell configurations. This allowed us to explore the boundaries of possible morphological variations within this group. We are integrating these computational results with laboratory observations to better comprehend large-scale evolutionary transitions in these organisms.\n\nThe architecture of mollusk shells follows fascinating geometric principles. Each shell essentially consists of a tubular structure that coils through space, completing 360-degree rotations. These rotational segments, termed whorls, wrap around a central columella. The growth pattern varies in expansion rate, with adjacent whorls separated by a linear depression called a suture. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically achieves the largest diameter. Above it lies the spire, encompassing all previous whorls, which terminates in the apex. The base occupies the opposite end, featuring the aperture - the opening through which the animal emerges.\n\nShell orientation can be described from multiple perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard presentation shows the shell in apertural view, with the opening facing the observer and apex directed upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a standardized protocol. Beginning with an apical view, one identifies the initial suture point and draws a reference line across the shell. Counting proceeds from this line, with measurements precise to quarter-whorl increments.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a series of successive apertures moving through four-dimensional space as the organism constructs its shell. This progression can be mapped using coordinates that track aperture centers and dimensional measurements. Such data enable both graphical and mathematical representations, allowing researchers to model variations in shell formation processes.",
            "Recent data indicates that Indonesia's progress in reducing newborn and infant death rates has stagnated during the previous decade. Despite achieving success in various Millennium Development Goals, particularly regarding water access and sanitation improvements, progress in both child and maternal healthcare falls significantly behind schedule for meeting 2015 objectives. Several factors contribute to these challenges, suggesting that broad healthcare infrastructure enhancement might prove more beneficial than isolated program-specific solutions.\n\nAlthough Indonesia has achieved a 72% rate of professionally-attended births, this statistic requires careful interpretation. Many of these attendants include traditional birthing assistants who lack medical expertise for managing complications, particularly in cases of severe bleeding, which remains a leading cause of maternal fatality. Furthermore, professional medical treatment for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions has decreased. Available information about post-birth care, though limited, suggests widespread inadequacies throughout the nation.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% nationwide. A stark urban-rural divide exists, with cities reporting 7% cesarean rates compared to just 2% in rural regions. This disparity highlights significant healthcare accessibility issues across different geographical areas. Economic disparities further compound these challenges, with a 27% difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies for enhancement, policymakers face a crucial decision between targeted programmatic interventions and comprehensive healthcare system strengthening. While specialized initiatives offer clear objectives and quick results, they present notable disadvantages. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other critical healthcare areas and create inefficient parallel systems with redundant administrative burdens. The HIV/AIDS funding impact on family planning services exemplifies these unintended consequences.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing numerous genres that defy simple categorization. Each primary musical style - whether it's jazz, rap, rock, folk, or country - has branched into countless subdivisions, creating an intricate web of musical expression. Among these, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly noteworthy, having evolved into an extraordinarily complex and emotionally charged genre since its emergence four decades ago.\n\nHeavy Metal's emotional palette, while predominantly exploring darker themes, demonstrates remarkable range. Its evolution has been organic and continuous, with musicians consistently pushing boundaries and establishing new subgenres. This process of musical innovation persists to this day, resulting in an ever-expanding universe of metal variations.\n\nThe contemporary metal landscape is so varied that defining its core characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has absorbed influences from numerous other musical styles, understanding its origins is crucial. To truly comprehend modern metal's diverse manifestations, one must examine it not merely as a genre, but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nMetal's essence lies in its intensity and complexity. It demands technical excellence from its practitioners and embraces extremes - in volume, instrumental prowess, theatrical presentation, and emotional expression. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic revolution of the 1970s, when musicians, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal distinguished itself by embracing darker themes at a time when mainstream music typically avoided such territory. Modern metal often draws inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic Era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles - widely regarded as one of heavy metal's precursors. Created as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcased the band's ability to produce darker, more intense music. Its inclusion on The White Album marked a significant moment in metal's early development, demonstrating its cyclical, drug-influenced themes.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, prior to the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, encompasses multiple layers of significance - it portrays both a female subject experiencing an enchanted landscape and symbolizes the artist's personal aspirations. Throughout his career, Rousseau yearned for artistic recognition while grappling with a fundamental artistic challenge: whether to embrace established artistic conventions or pursue his unique creative direction.\n\nUnderstanding Rousseau's background provides essential context for interpreting The Dream. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, he came from a middle-class background, with his father working as a prosperous hardware merchant. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau lacked formal artistic training and spent his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - he lost eight children in infancy and his first wife, Clémence, leaving him with a single daughter, Julia. Art became his sanctuary and source of renewal during these difficult times. His artistic perspective reflected his working-class origins, contrasting sharply with the romanticized depictions of peasant life common among his peers.\n\nThe timing of Rousseau's artistic pursuit coincided with an era of exceptional artistic innovation, making his quest for recognition particularly challenging. Despite years of dedication, widespread appreciation for his work emerged only when artists like Matisse were gaining prominence. Art historian Jan Gordon draws an interesting comparison between these two figures, noting their contrasting motivations: while Matisse actively sought to avoid conventional artistic expression, Rousseau paradoxically aspired to create work conventional enough to gain acceptance from the established artistic community.",
            "The relationship between moral principles and artistic expression has long fascinated scholars and philosophers. This connection runs deeper than mere coincidence. While Keats famously equated truth with beauty in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" the significance of this parallel extends beyond poetic metaphor. Unlike traditional knowledge acquisition through formal education or lived experiences, our understanding of both moral principles and artistic merit seems to emerge from a more intuitive source. These fields focus primarily on analytical observation rather than prescriptive rules - we examine why certain artworks resonate or why specific actions feel ethically sound, instead of establishing rigid guidelines for creating art or determining moral behavior.\n\nInterestingly, neither artistic criticism nor ethical analysis can fully encompass the essence of their subjects. Consider discussions about masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - while experts may analyze technical elements such as composition and historical context, these aspects alone cannot explain its enduring impact. People often preface their appreciation of art with phrases like \"There's something special about it\" before delving into technical analysis. This ineffable quality exists in both artistic appreciation and moral understanding. As noted by O'Connor, narrative storytelling often communicates what direct statements cannot, suggesting that both art and ethics possess elements that transcend conventional description.\n\nThe profound connection between morality and artistic expression may stem from their shared appeal to our intuitive understanding. This link becomes particularly evident in literature, where moral considerations naturally intertwine with artistic expression. Literature holds special significance because it inherently deals with human values and ethical choices, making it uniquely positioned to explore moral dimensions in ways that other art forms might not. The value systems we encounter in literature mirror those we grapple with in real life, creating a natural bridge between artistic expression and ethical contemplation.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerhouse nation, its unified territories stretching from Munich's alpine foothills to Kiel's maritime shores along the Baltic. A common thread of identity weaves through the western city of Cologne along the Rhine, across the heartland, and reaches the historic Dresden nestled by the Elbe River. This cohesive nation-state, however, emerged from a complex tapestry of diverse peoples and ancestral groups.\n\nThe land known historically as Germania represents the ancestral homeland of the German people, though the etymology of this designation remains contentious among academics. Historical records from Tacitus suggest the term originated with the Tungri tribe, who were called Germans before their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. The term \"Germanus\" first appeared in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, borrowed from Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Linguistic scholars propose various origins: some point to ancient Gallic words for \"neighbor,\" others to the Germanic \"ger\" spear, while certain experts connect it to Old Irish \"garim,\" suggesting a reference to vocal characteristics.\n\nHistorical documentation from 98 CE, specifically Tacitus's \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" presents the Germanic peoples as indigenous inhabitants, suggesting minimal external influence through migration or cultural exchange. Tacitus emphasized the region's forbidding nature, questioning why anyone would choose such harsh terrain over Mediterranean comforts unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nRoman interaction with Germania remained primarily commercial and military in nature. While the Empire conducted periodic campaigns into Germanic territories, permanent settlement proved rare. Germanic tribes, emerging prominently during the first century, maintained a complex relationship with Rome, engaging in trade and occasionally serving in Roman military units while preserving their independence along the Empire's frontiers.",
            "Shakespeare's masterpiece Twelfth Night explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The ultimate dilemma emerges when one must choose between maintaining their true identity and preserving social bonds, as revelations of deceit often strain relationships beyond repair.\n\nThe narrative particularly scrutinizes gender-based deception, raising fundamental questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine attire represents a survival strategy in unfamiliar territory, yet this choice isolates her from feminine companionship.\n\nThis calculated deception produces unforeseen complications. Viola's convincing male persona captivates Olivia, leading to a case of mistaken identity with her brother Sebastian: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Additionally, her disguise complicates her growing attachment to Orsino, who laments: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nContemporary interpretations might view the play as an examination of how artifice can unveil latent desires, particularly regarding Olivia and Orsino's reactions. Their responses to Viola/Cesario potentially suggest unexplored aspects of their own identities. However, Shakespeare likely intended Olivia's character as a satirical commentary on superficial attraction rather than an exploration of sexual fluidity. This interpretation gains credence through her seamless transfer of affections from Cesario to Sebastian, ultimately accepting Viola in a familial context: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The historical record shows varying perspectives on colonial administration across different territories. While instances of severe mistreatment occurred, particularly in German South West Africa against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples, the broader picture reveals a complex tapestry of administrative approaches. Educational initiatives, for instance, demonstrated remarkable variation across regions under German authority.\n\nPost-World War I assessments by British administrators in former German East Africa (Tanganyika) revealed an unexpected discovery: a substantial population of well-educated African inhabitants. Similar positive reports emerged regarding educational achievements in Kamerun and other territories. However, the narrative shifts dramatically when examining South West Africa, known today as Namibia.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational framework established in East Africa, South West African educational development relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal governmental assistance. Conversely, European residents benefited from substantial educational investment, including state-funded schools and enhanced support for religious educational institutions. These disparate approaches created lasting implications. While other territories produced numerous educated indigenous populations, South West Africa's native inhabitants largely remained without access to formal education.\n\nRecent scholarship has explored the underlying causes of this educational disparity, particularly examining newly available evidence regarding settler attitudes and administrative policies. The academic literature, predominantly German-language sources from the early 1900s, initially focused on descriptive accounts of colonial educational systems. Subsequent English-language research has provided comparative analyses and deeper exploration of specific educational aspects across different territories.\n\nCohen's influential research comparing South West African and East African education suggests that demographic factors, particularly the size of the European settler population, significantly influenced educational policy development. South West Africa's relatively moderate climate, despite its substantial desert regions, attracted a larger European presence. By 1913, the territory hosted nearly 15,000 European settlers, almost triple the number in East Africa, its closest competitor in terms of settler population.",
            "During the mid-19th century, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that persisted for nearly six decades, spanning from 1836 to 1893. This period of strained relations culminated in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in Mexico's defeat and the subsequent American acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Numerous confrontations continued until the early 1900s, with conflicts rooted in fundamental differences regarding faith, societal values, and economic interests.\n\nSuch neighboring-state conflicts are not uncommon in global history. Countries sharing geographical boundaries frequently encounter competing interests that foster antagonistic relationships. Cuba and Mexico stand out as particularly notable examples of nations that have experienced prolonged diplomatic challenges with the United States, while other Latin American countries have generally maintained positive relationships with their northern neighbor.\n\nCultural and spiritual differences played a crucial role in this historical tension. The American Protestant establishment harbored deep suspicions toward Catholic institutions, much as later generations would view political ideologies like fascism and communism with distrust. This religious divide echoed earlier Anglo-Spanish rivalries, with both nations inheriting their predecessors' mutual suspicion.\n\nHistorical records document seventeen distinct confrontations between these nations during their period of rivalry. Most incidents involved cross-border security issues, particularly bandit incursions targeting frontier settlements. These security challenges persisted until both governments implemented stronger military presence along their shared boundary.\n\nThe antagonistic relationship gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic ties with the United States. By the century's end, American interests had shifted from territorial expansion to commercial investment, fundamentally altering the dynamic between these neighboring nations.",
            "In 2008, an unexpected medical condition transformed my life overnight, leaving me incapacitated with a rare disorder I'd never heard of before.\n\nAt that point, I was working in healthcare. The decision to enter this field stemmed from my unstable childhood, seeking the promise of steady employment that everyone assured me existed in medicine. Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I opted for what seemed the safer path.\n\nThe reality hit hard when, at age 46, I found myself alone and financially vulnerable, unable to continue working. Currently, after more than a decade receiving disability benefits, my personal possessions have dwindled to almost nothing. Daily survival remains challenging, constantly threatening my sense of stability and worth. While uncertainty pervades every aspect of my existence, one truth stands out: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. Such crises have a way of revealing our fundamental vulnerability.\n\nLife's challenges, whether minor or major, arrive without warning. Despite careful planning, certain obstacles prove insurmountable without assistance. \n\nWhile I acknowledge the need to reduce dependence on federal programs in America, particularly given their current state of dysfunction, I believe the solution lies in rebuilding community connections rather than pursuing isolation. The image of each household retreating to private bunkers seems counterproductive.\n\nHistorical revisionists often glorify American individualism, but our nation's true foundation rests on community cooperation and resource sharing. Consider the westward expansion: success depended on collective effort, not solitary endeavors.\n\nPrudent preparation remains valuable. My own emergency supplies include medical provisions, water treatment equipment, protective materials, illumination sources, and non-perishable food. Those with appropriate resources should consider sustainable practices like small-scale farming and food preservation, or installing alternative heating methods where feasible.\n\nHowever, the most crucial preparation may be establishing connections within your community.",
            "During the mid-first millennium BCE, an individual emerged who would transform the spiritual landscape of Asia. This figure, later known as the Buddha, established philosophical principles that evolved into what we now recognize as Buddhism, with Theravada representing its most traditional branch. As we examine this ancient belief system, now approaching its 2,500th year, we observe significant transformations from its original form. Consider, for example, contemporary practices in Sri Lanka, where an annual ritual involving the ceremonial cutting of water demonstrates how religious expressions have expanded beyond the founder's original teachings. These evolutionary changes extend beyond mere cultural practices, reaching into fundamental theological principles. The adaptations within Theravada Buddhism, affecting both ordained and lay practitioners, reflect responses to various influences, some originating from within the tradition and others from external sources, with impacts ranging from constructive to destructive.\n\nTo properly analyze these developments, we must establish clear definitions. Influences stemming from Buddhist practitioners themselves, regardless of their status, constitute internal factors. Conversely, pressures from non-Buddhist sources represent external elements. Additionally, we distinguish between antagonistic forces - those aimed at undermining Buddhist communities - and neutral influences that, while not intentionally supportive or harmful, may nonetheless affect the tradition's development.\n\nThe foundational elements of Theravada Buddhism center on several key concepts. Practitioners seek guidance through three primary sources: the Buddha's example, his teachings (Dhamma), and the monastic community (Sangha). The canonical texts, known as the Tripitaka, encompass three distinct collections: discourses (Sutta Pitaka), monastic regulations (Vinaya Pitaka), and philosophical treatises (Abhidhamma Pitaka). Core philosophical principles include the absence of an eternal self (Anatta), the pervasive nature of suffering (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Understanding these concepts is crucial for ending the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and eliminating destructive mental states: craving, aversion, and ignorance. The tradition prescribes ethical guidelines, with lay followers observing five basic precepts prohibiting harmful actions, while monastics follow more extensive regulations. Central to Buddhist thought are the four noble truths, beginning with the recognition of life's inherent challenges, identifying attachment as their source, and affirming the possibility of liberation."
