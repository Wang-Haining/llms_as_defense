            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the realm of negotiations, cultural understanding serves as a cornerstone for success. However, we must resist the temptation to oversimplify cultural characteristics. The notion of culture defies simple categorization; it exists as a complex tapestry of beliefs, behaviors, and traditions that resist broad generalizations. Sweeping statements about national characteristics often prove counterproductive. Instead, negotiators benefit from examining how specific cultural elements influence the dynamics at the bargaining table.\n\nWhen engaging with unfamiliar cultural contexts, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own experiences. Effective cross-cultural engagement requires comprehensive research, from historical analysis to understanding contemporary social norms. Rather than attempting to modify or critique another culture, successful negotiators adapt their approach to work within established cultural frameworks. This becomes particularly crucial when operating from a position of reduced leverage or in unfamiliar territory.\n\nCultural distinctions extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its unique cultural identity, manifested through various practices and policies. These differences emerge in workplace expectations, communication styles, and organizational values. For example, corporate environments may range from highly structured to notably flexible. Even within single organizations, cultural variations often exist across geographical locations and operational units. While some societies may present a more unified cultural front, careful observation typically reveals underlying complexity.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides insight into cultural motivations and behaviors. In societies prioritizing group harmony and reputation, negotiators typically avoid actions that might cause public embarrassment. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may focus primarily on securing advantageous terms. While these cultural patterns merit consideration during preparation, successful negotiators also recognize the importance of understanding their counterparts as individuals, moving beyond cultural stereotypes to forge meaningful connections.",
            "Within religious philosophical discourse, we encounter a fascinating dichotomy between two prominent theologians' approaches to proving divine existence. The biblical assertion \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" serves as a launching point for examining these contrasting methodologies. When analyzing the arguments presented by Anselm and Aquinas regarding God's existence, we must operate within their shared theological framework - specifically, the Judeo-Christian conception of deity. Attempting to broaden the scope to encompass alternative divine conceptualizations would undermine our ability to effectively evaluate their respective arguments. However, despite their intellectual rigor, both approaches demonstrate certain limitations in establishing an comprehensive foundation for theological belief.\n\nAnselm's methodology emphasizes introspective revelation, suggesting that divine truth manifests through internal contemplation. His argument posits that our capacity to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence, as the very notion of God within human consciousness validates His reality. This internal validation approach, while perhaps philosophically elegant, relies heavily on subjective understanding and what Christianity traditionally terms \"faith.\"\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions an empirical approach, constructing his argument through observable phenomena and logical deduction. His famous five proofs - addressing change, causation, contingency, gradation, and design - attempt to demonstrate God's existence through rational necessity rather than spiritual intuition. This methodology particularly serves evangelistic purposes, as it provides a framework for conversion based on intellectual persuasion rather than requiring a preliminary leap of faith. Aquinas effectively employs the metaphor of a jigsaw puzzle: one can deduce the characteristics and existence of a missing piece through the logical implications of the surrounding completed sections.",
            "Literary authors employ diverse strategies to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In analyzing \"The Great Gatsby,\" we observe how the author implements various literary devices to achieve his narrative goals. One notable approach involves the unconventional pairing of descriptors with objects, creating unexpected associations. Additionally, the text employs symbolic elements, particularly through a sophisticated color palette including shades of gold, emerald, alabaster/slate, and crimson/rose.\n\nThe novel demonstrates particular mastery in its treatment of chromatic symbolism, especially regarding the alabaster/slate and crimson/rose spectrum. These hues serve as powerful metaphorical devices, subtly influencing readers' perceptions throughout the narrative.\n\nThe alabaster/slate motif consistently represents conformity and social standing, with lighter tones suggesting refinement while darker shades indicate age and decay. This pattern emerges early, as characters frequently appear in pale attire - from the protagonist's companions to party attendees. The sole deviation occurs during the vibrant party sequence, where \"corridors explode with primary pigments.\"\n\nThis color scheme extends beyond fashion, permeating the environment: metropolitan canyons gleam pale, party guest lists fade to graphite, and residential structures resemble \"uniform slices of pale cake.\" The pattern encompasses both individuals and locations: shared childhood memories appear colorless, industrial zones fade to ash, and peripheral characters - from immigrant children to elderly vendors - exist in monochromatic tones.\n\nFollowing this established symbolism, the author leverages these shades to undersign themes of conformity and banality. This technique particularly illuminates the characterization of certain figures, notably the female lead, who repeatedly appears surrounded by pale imagery - her vehicle, attire, and accessories all reinforcing her role as an idealized, yet ultimately conventional, object of desire.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local farms yield an impressive variety of produce, ranging from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh leafy vegetables and aromatic herbs. The region's agricultural bounty extends to stone fruits, various berry varieties, artisanal honey, and diverse pepper cultivars. Local residents demonstrate significant enthusiasm for community-supported agriculture (CSA), particularly organic options, with numerous programs maintaining extensive waitlists. The demand for naturally produced dairy and eggs remains consistently robust.\n\nMany agricultural enterprises in the region have diversified their revenue streams by offering educational tours and recreational activities, including nature walks and wildlife observation. This multifaceted approach enables property owners to leverage governmental assistance while enhancing natural habitats and creating additional income opportunities through various educational initiatives.\n\nWhile organic cultivation methods promote enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem health through chemical-free practices, they present unique challenges. These operations typically demand heightened labor involvement, meticulous pest management, and often experience greater crop losses compared to conventional farming methods. Smaller organic operations also face efficiency disadvantages relative to large-scale industrial farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as implementing cover crops, managing grazing patterns, controlling invasive species, and maintaining specific habitat conditions, introduce further operational complexities and expenses.\n\nThe subject property comprises 160 acres situated near Potrero, within unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The landscape features a mixture of chaparral, non-indigenous Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodland communities. This location falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone, as designated by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The area serves as habitat for numerous protected species, including the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher, among others facing population decline.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples inhabited this region for generations before ranchers and wood merchants established themselves in the nineteenth century. The property's origins trace back to an original homestead grant, suggesting historical usage for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis examined current market listings and available governmental support programs to evaluate viable options for small-scale agricultural operations emphasizing wildlife conservation, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection - particularly brothers - that transcends ordinary relationships. This connection encompasses various sentiments: affection, honor, envy, and sometimes even malice. No one comprehends a brother quite like another brother, as they function almost as mirrors to one another. Critical moments reveal the true essence of their relationship, whether positive or negative, though such revelations often exact a significant toll.

Their genuine nature manifests in their choices and the subsequent results.\n\nThis sibling dynamic takes center stage in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where readers witness two brothers' journey through richly depicted surroundings. Their story culminates in a powerful scene where fierce pride collides with crushing failure, leaving only one survivor.

The narrator's perspective illuminates the intricate emotional landscape and worldview that shape the story's events.\n\nThe older brother's motivations stem primarily from ego. His initial encounters with Doodle reveal an underlying frustration - he yearned for a companion capable of matching his physical prowess, someone to \"race to Horsehead Landing\" or \"climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" These aspirations proved unrealistic given Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which threatened his very survival and precluded strenuous activities. The protagonist's childhood dreams shattered upon facing this reality. His reaction manifested darkly, even contemplating smothering his infant brother - an unusually sinister thought for a child. Yet Doodle's innocent smile pierced this darkness, suggesting that beneath the resentment lay an inherent fraternal bond. This transformation hints at the superficial nature of his initial hostility.",
            "Our cognitive processor - the brain - functions as an intricate system for managing and interpreting data. Throughout history, people have drawn various parallels to understand its operation, from ancient analogies of wax tablets to modern-day computational devices. Yet we must exercise caution with such comparisons, as they often oversimplify this remarkable organ's true complexity.\n\nThe process of neural interpretation begins when our sensory receptors convert external stimuli - whether tactile, thermal, auditory, or visual - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through dual processing pathways. Consider observing a white canvas containing a dark square: the primary pathway assembles basic elements like hue, alignment, and edge detection to construct the image, while the secondary pathway expedites recognition by utilizing preliminary conclusions from the first process. This dual approach helps distinguish whether we're seeing a dark object against light or a light-colored surface with a square opening.\n\nNeural mechanisms continuously filter incoming data streams, determining their significance and appropriate cognitive destination. While your neural network processes countless environmental details - like individual grass blades beneath your feet - selective attention mechanisms prevent cognitive overload. Yet these same mechanisms ensure critical stimuli, like hearing your name in a crowded space, break through the filter. This selective processing occurs continuously across multiple cognitive levels.\n\nData retention involves various memory systems - immediate sensory recall, temporary working storage, and permanent retention. The encoding process varies by input type. For instance, verbal information storage can occur through visual pattern recognition, sound-based association, or meaning-based interpretation. Retention mechanisms differ by memory type: temporary recall may involve neural circuit loops sustaining information for approximately twenty seconds, while permanent storage likely depends on protein structure modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks explaining knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent theory suggests information exists as interconnected concept nodes, forming association networks. In this framework, related concepts - such as \"desk,\" \"wood,\" and \"furniture\" - form linked neural pathways.",
            "The economic collapse of 2007 marked a devastating period in American history. As businesses shuttered, home values plummeted, and major institutions crumbled, the nation faced its most severe financial downturn since the Great Depression. This catastrophe, which continues to influence our economy, emerged from a perfect storm of misguided policies and complex financial instruments.\n\nAt its core, the crisis stemmed from aggressive lending practices encouraged by well-intentioned but shortsighted political initiatives. Financial institutions, responding to various pressures, began offering risky loans to borrowers who traditionally wouldn't qualify. These loans were then transformed into sophisticated financial products, creating a web of interconnected risks throughout the banking system. When homeowners began defaulting, this house of cards collapsed, sending shockwaves through the global economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were planted during the late 1990s. In an effort to promote homeownership among middle and lower-income Americans, policymakers implemented measures that fundamentally altered lending practices. A prescient 1999 New York Times article by Steven Holmes warned about potential consequences, noting that Fannie Mae faced mounting pressure to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes cautioned that such practices could necessitate government intervention during an economic downturn.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated by financial innovation. Novel mortgage products and complex derivatives proliferated throughout the market. These instruments, including adjustable-rate mortgages and various securitized products, created unprecedented interconnections within the financial system. This heightened complexity left the economy particularly vulnerable to housing market fluctuations.\n\nWhen the bubble finally burst, the carnage was widespread. Major investment banks reported staggering losses, with the top five institutions holding mortgage-related debt equivalent to nearly one-third of America's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of legendary Wall Street firms, while government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, holding $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, required federal takeover by late 2008.",
            "Let's discuss the pitfalls of exposition in storytelling. While it might seem tempting to unleash a torrent of background information, this approach often proves counterproductive. Many writers, myself included, have experienced the frustration of encountering walls of explanatory text that bring narratives to a grinding halt.\n\nConsider exposition as a necessary evil rather than a storytelling tool. Though we're all familiar with the golden rule of \"show, don't tell,\" even experienced authors sometimes succumb to the temptation of information dumping. It's like having two conflicting voices in your head - one pushing you to establish context quickly, the other urging you to detail every minor character's life story.\n\nAt its core, exposition simply conveys information to readers. In movies, you'll recognize it when characters engage in unrealistic conversations purely to inform the audience. Literature employs similar techniques through narrative description.\n\nTo illustrate: imagine reading about a protagonist's whirlwind romance, marriage, and subsequent tragic loss of their spouse - all condensed into two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach robs readers of emotional investment. Instead, effective storytelling would develop the husband's character through meaningful interactions, demonstrate the relationship's impact through specific moments, and allow readers to form genuine connections with both characters. This investment makes the tragedy resonant rather than merely informative.\n\nThe challenge lies in avoiding the temptation to rush through character backgrounds. When introducing someone new - perhaps a former Air Force veteran now managing a gas station, twice divorced, with weekend fishing habits and entrepreneurial dreams - resist the urge to present these details as a simple checklist.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable stories on NBC 4's morning broadcast. The primary coverage centered on a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities arrested Shad Hostettler following an alleged knife attack on his spouse. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nSubsequently, they reported on an incident involving an 18-year-old victim, Travis Buyers, who sustained critical injuries in a shooting at Sharon Woods. Law enforcement, including SWAT personnel, were investigating with no immediate suspects. The limited coverage of this incident appeared to reflect certain media biases in crime reporting, particularly regarding demographic representation in news coverage.\n\nThe broadcast continued with details about an investigation into damage sustained by a Med-Flight helicopter, specifically a perforation from what analysts determined to be a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers announced a substantial $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nA meteorological update followed, projecting afternoon precipitation and temperatures maintaining around 80-85 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend. This segment's concise nature appeared designed to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe coverage included a report about a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, where the description of the suspect received notably detailed attention regarding physical characteristics. The final segment discussed the sentencing of a Texas-based narcotics distributor, Rene Rodriguez, who received a 300-month sentence for marijuana trafficking operations between Texas and Ohio. The peculiar choice of expressing the sentence in months rather than years was particularly noteworthy.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, certain patterns emerged regarding the emphasis placed on demographic information in criminal reporting, raising questions about editorial decisions in news presentation.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. These investment vehicles mirror various market segments while offering advantages typically associated with individual stocks, including short-selling opportunities, margin trading, and single-share purchase options. Despite providing these sophisticated features, ETFs maintain remarkably competitive expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.\n\nInvestors should note that ETF transactions incur brokerage commissions, similar to stock trades. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across various sectors and asset classes. However, prudent investors must conduct thorough due diligence to verify marketed advantages such as diversification benefits and their actual magnitude. This analysis focuses on examining the IHF ETF alongside its primary constituents to assess whether holding the ETF delivers comparable advantages to maintaining positions in its top components, while also exploring potential alternative configurations that might yield superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\nTo maintain analytical clarity, our investigation concentrates on the ten largest holdings, which constitute approximately 63.58% of the fund's total assets. The subsequent analysis details these positions and their respective weightings.\n\nTo evaluate how effectively these ten positions represent the complete IHF ETF, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the corresponding portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns. Detailed calculations appear in the accompanying data set.\n\nAnalysis reveals that constructing a portfolio using only the top ten holdings generates returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points, representing a 16% performance improvement. Additionally, this concentrated portfolio demonstrates a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. These preliminary findings suggest potential advantages in holding the top components directly. However, statistical significance testing becomes necessary to validate these apparent differences.\n\nTo determine statistical distinctiveness between these investment approaches, we calculated normalized standard deviations for each top holding, enabling direct comparison with the ETF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of the participation data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a concerning decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. Multiple factors potentially contributed to this downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our New England institution naturally deterred bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The academic calendar also played a significant role, as December brings final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties, followed by an extended holiday break when campus activity diminishes substantially.\n\nWhile these factors explain certain participation patterns, including January's low numbers coinciding with the spring semester startup, they fail to account for February's unexpectedly minimal submission rate. Such initiatives often experience peak enthusiasm initially, followed by diminishing engagement. To counter this effect, our team implemented a targeted \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, successfully boosting participation rates. Nevertheless, maintaining consistent involvement proved challenging, particularly given the academic calendar's inherent disruptions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative transportation initiatives stems from America's car-centric culture, where personal vehicles represent autonomy and convenience. Our incentive structure included local business gift certificates, covering dining establishments, cafes, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating escalating reward tiers might have sustained higher participation levels. While initial prizes adequately motivated early involvement, introducing progressively valuable incentives - perhaps culminating in major prizes like premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - could have prevented the observed engagement decline. This graduated reward system might have effectively countered participation fatigue and maintained momentum throughout the project's duration.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, encompassing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces employed clever editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns across most productions and some intriguing deviations in later works. The typical trick film from this era exhibited several distinctive characteristics: studio-based settings, theater-style presentation, stationary camera work, broader shot compositions, and single-scene structures. Interestingly, as the century turned, some bold filmmakers began experimenting with multiple-scene narratives.\n\nThese productions consistently utilized indoor studio sets, framed like traditional theater stages. Cameras remained fixed in position, never tracking the performers or props. This staging approach reflected strong influences from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic shows. The static camera setup naturally constrained performer movements to lateral directions, rarely allowing depth-wise motion. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where performers exclusively traverse the frame horizontally, entering stage right and moving across, while the camera maintains its fixed perspective.\n\nThe theatrical influence manifested in the predominant use of wide and occasional medium-range shots. Notably absent from these films were any close-up compositions. This mirrored the live theater experience, where audiences viewed entire performances within the stage's physical boundaries. Performers typically maintained their distance from the camera, operating in the middle ground of the frame.\n\nMost productions adhered to a single-scene format, resulting in brief running times rarely exceeding sixty seconds. This structure naturally limited narrative complexity, with most films showcasing straightforward magical demonstrations, transformations, or vanishing acts rather than developed storylines. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as continuous scenes often involved multiple shots cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate shots were joined to create the illusion of decapitation.",
            "Literary scholars often note the fascinating contradiction inherent in the term \"Gothic Novel.\" As explored in Ian Watt's analysis \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" this genre represents a unique fusion of antiquity and modernity. Throughout its evolution, the Gothic genre has weathered diverse critical reactions - some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nWhen Horace Walpole introduced \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he effectively birthed the Gothic genre by masterfully blending classical theatrical elements with contemporary narrative techniques. His innovative approach, which he simply termed \"A Gothic Story,\" established a new paradigm in literary expression. The genre draws heavily from medieval influences, incorporating elements of theater, architectural motifs, and cultural traditions from that era. Interestingly, by Walpole's time, the term \"gothic\" had accumulated various connotations, often carrying implications of primitiveness when contrasted with contemporary cultural and literary developments.\n\nThe enduring appeal of Gothic literature stems from its unique combination of theatrical grandeur and psychological intimacy - a characteristic made possible by the novel format. This duality allows the genre to maintain relevance across generations while simultaneously feeling both antiquated and fresh to modern readers.\n\nThe concept of chivalry emerges as a central theme in Gothic literature, particularly evident in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Medieval chivalric ideals undergo both preservation and transformation within the narrative. This focus on chivalry reflects contemporary anxieties about moral decay - Walpole, writing during politically turbulent times, appeared to view the medieval period as a lost golden age of virtue. This perspective manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal encompasses traditional knightly virtues while simultaneously exemplifying the Gothic tendency toward dramatic excess.\n\nNotably, Frederic's character embodies quintessential chivalric attributes: his royal status, his profound response to tragedy, and his presumed martyrdom at the hands of infidels all contribute to an idealized portrait of medieval nobility. This characterization, while deliberately exaggerated, serves to highlight the perceived moral gulf between past and present societies.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material processing to final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, represents a comprehensive approach to orchestrating, implementing, and monitoring supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements effectively and swiftly. The framework consists of six fundamental components: production, supply, inventory management, facility location, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nAt the heart of supply chain operations lies production, serving as its cornerstone. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodology of manufacturing processes. Understanding market dynamics becomes paramount, as it provides the clearest indication of consumer preferences and demands. Through careful market analysis and consumer behavior interpretation, decision-makers can determine optimal product mix and quantities. Subsequently, they must identify appropriate manufacturing facilities that can achieve desired volume and quality benchmarks while ensuring customer satisfaction. The production phase concludes with detailed workflow scheduling and equipment maintenance planning. The significance of meticulous planning cannot be overstated; any oversight could result in substantial financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second cornerstone, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Manufacturing operations often encompass multiple specialized divisions, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division allocation for various production phases. Additionally, they might explore external partnerships to enhance operational velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while optimizing cost structures.",
            "The literary landscape of Victorian England, while often associated with meticulous detail and upper-class narratives, produced some remarkable exceptions. Both Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge from these conventional patterns, embracing darker themes and supernatural elements that set them apart from their contemporaries. These works leverage mystery and unconventional storytelling techniques to develop complex character psychologies and emotional depths.\n\nConsider this passage from Oliver Twist:\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nDream sequences emerge as a powerful narrative device in both novels, though each author employs them distinctively. In Oliver Twist, these surreal interludes illuminate the protagonist's psychological state and his subconscious understanding of his circumstances. Chapter 28's shooting scene exemplifies this technique, as Oliver experiences a dreamlike recollection of his trauma. The narrative emphasizes his powerlessness through vivid hallucinations featuring Sikes and Crackit. His sensory perception becomes distorted; the \"unseen hand\" that guides him goes unnoticed, while persistent pain merges with an overwhelming sense of fear. This disorientation raises questions about agency and fate in Oliver's journey. The scene suggests his gradual submission to circumstances, possibly indicating Fagin's successful manipulation of his spirit. The absence of self-preservation instincts in such a dire situation implies a deeper psychological surrender.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.",
            "During my time as a tutor in an elementary after-school program, I encountered a situation that opened my eyes to the complexities of language learning. While assisting students across various subjects, with particular expertise in literacy and English, I was specifically assigned to work with a third-grade student named Adrian who exhibited unusual reading patterns.\n\nInitially, his struggles seemed puzzling - he demonstrated inconsistent letter recognition despite being completely fluent in spoken English. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother during a day when most students were away on a field trip. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root of Adrian's challenges: while he was verbally proficient in English, his foundational understanding of the English alphabet was lacking.\n\nThis experience illuminates a broader educational challenge, particularly prevalent in California's school system, where language barriers manifest in unexpected ways. Even students who appear fully assimilated may struggle with fundamental literacy skills. The solution to such challenges requires a multifaceted approach, incorporating various educational strategies rather than relying on a single method.\n\nResearch demonstrates that dual-language education programs yield superior academic outcomes for all participants, not just English language learners. While implementing comprehensive bilingual education may seem daunting, practical solutions exist. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual, schools can employ specialized bilingual support staff to facilitate learning. This approach ensures that both native English speakers and English language learners receive the benefits of dual-language instruction while maintaining realistic staffing requirements.",
            "Humans have long grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. While some families guide their children through structured religious education in churches or synagogues, others encourage introspective spiritual exploration. The beliefs we inherit from our families often become our initial framework, though many individuals eventually forge their own spiritual paths. Some embrace faith wholeheartedly, while others reject supernatural notions entirely, grounding themselves solely in tangible reality. This spiritual journey, unique to each person, represents our quest to illuminate life's deeper meanings.\n\nI remember that rainy afternoon clearly. Sitting beside my father on our covered porch, cigarette smoke mingling with the humid air, I asked about his preferred bird species. \"A cardinal,\" he replied softly, his gaze fixed on the downpour that overwhelmed our garden's vegetation. His appearance had changed dramatically - clothes hanging loose on his diminished frame, his once-full hair noticeably thinned. Words about his condition remained unspoken between us, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, I silently moved my chair closer, sharing in his contemplation of the summer storm.\n\nThat winter, shortly after I turned twenty-two, he succumbed to his illness. The aggressive treatments had prolonged his life beyond medical expectations, though they merely extended his suffering. My faith wavered during those dark nights, questioning the existence of a benevolent deity who would permit such prolonged anguish. Prayer felt futile, like shouting into an endless void.\n\nMaking a conscious choice, I stayed away during his final moments. The thought of witnessing his last breath seemed unbearable - I preferred preserving memories of his vitality rather than documenting his decline. Understanding him as intimately as I did, I knew he wouldn't want me present for that moment. Instead, I retreated to my bedroom, waiting in isolation for news that never came through a phone call.",
            "Among the earliest champions of Republican ideology stood John Taylor of Caroline, whose agricultural background and limited political experience shaped his passionate advocacy for individual liberties and governmental reform. His agricultural roots profoundly influenced his philosophical framework, particularly regarding governmental structures, constitutional interpretation, and judicial matters.\n\nThe American experiment fascinated Taylor, who recognized its unique position to establish an unprecedented governmental system. Without the constraints of established traditions, he believed America could pioneer genuine self-governance. Taylor emphasized the interconnected nature of fundamental human rights, arguing that these liberties formed an inseparable whole - compromise one, and the entire structure would eventually collapse. Society, he maintained, must transcend the primitive \"natural state\" where physical strength and cunning determined success.\n\nTaylor's vision for an optimal society centered on addressing humanity's dual nature. His framework acknowledged both virtuous and corrupt human tendencies, asserting that \"governmental characteristics mirror human ones.\" He championed principles supporting agricultural development and private property while opposing capitalistic excess. Taylor theorized that properly structured institutions could function effectively despite leadership's inherent self-interest. While he viewed self-interest as a universal motivator, he distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nAs a Constitutional purist, Taylor advocated for precise adherence to the founding document, seeking to restrict federal authority to explicitly granted powers. His concerns about governmental overreach stemmed from fears of costly, potentially tyrannical administration. However, he cautioned against overly literal interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the founders' intent. Notably, Taylor elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more accurate reflection of state sovereignty within the American system.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, taking in the scene below without emotion. With clinical detachment, I observed what lay before me, my thoughts flowing like water - present yet impossible to grasp. The experience felt almost meditative, my consciousness floating above any concrete analysis.\n\nI recalled enrolling in an art course years ago, where the instructor recommended Betty Edwards' Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since childhood, I'd harbored dreams of becoming an artist, and this text promised to unlock those abilities. One particularly useful technique involved using a viewfinder - a simple frame that transformed complex scenes into manageable compositions, like reducing a cluttered kitchen view to just a single bowl of fruit.\n\nBut in this moment, no such framing device could help. The sight commanded my full attention, leaving me transfixed. Great artists are known for their signature periods - Picasso's blues, Monet's gardens, the vibrant palettes of Renaissance Italy. If I were to classify this scene before me, it would surely be my \"Brown Period,\" though not for reasons anyone would celebrate.\n\nWith deliberate movement, I reached for my tool, muscles engaging as I initiated what could have been a masterful stroke. The water moved in elegant spirals, pristine and clear. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. Growing impatient, I jammed the handle down again, but the stubborn brown mass remained steadfast, clinging to the porcelain like a defiant mollusk.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, green tie choking my neck, mop nearby, contemplating this unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron. After several more unsuccessful attempts, I resigned myself to the inevitable. Methodically wrapping my hand in layers of toilet paper until it resembled protective gear, I steeled myself for the unpleasant task ahead, bending forward like someone reaching into an oven, though what awaited was far from a holiday feast.",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among adolescent drivers demands our immediate attention. Research conducted by various institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, reveals a concerning correlation between neurological development and driving capabilities. The underdeveloped adolescent brain, coupled with limited driving experience, contributes significantly to increased incidents of fatal collisions, vehicle overturning, excessive speed violations, and road departures.\n\nStudies from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlight a disturbing pattern linking passenger age demographics to collision frequency. This data becomes particularly relevant when considering the social dynamics of teenage transportation habits.\n\nWhile certain jurisdictions have implemented restricted licensing programs limiting driving hours and passenger capacity, these measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem persists: empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that younger drivers lack the cognitive maturity necessary for safe vehicle operation.\n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman's research, featured in USA Today, suggests that risk-seeking behavior peaks during late adolescence, specifically before age 20. This scientific insight supports postponing full driving privileges until this developmental phase concludes. The urgency of addressing this matter intensifies when considering demographic projections: the children of Baby Boomers will soon reach driving age, potentially introducing millions of inexperienced operators to our roadways.\n\nA comprehensive solution requires standardized national regulations. Educational institutions could maintain their driver education programs, but actual licensing would be restricted to individuals 18 and older. The existing framework of provisional permits and supervised practice hours could remain intact, utilizing current state requirements as a baseline (e.g., California's model of 6 hours of professional instruction plus 50 hours of supervised practice).\n\nGiven that mortality statistics reflect a nationwide pattern, federal oversight would provide consistent protection across all jurisdictions. This proposal builds upon existing regulatory frameworks rather than introducing revolutionary concepts.",
            "An Investigation into Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) represents a fascinating intersection between neurology and auditory function. Unlike traditional hearing impairments, individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing capabilities but struggle with their brain's interpretation of auditory signals. The disorder affects how the central nervous system processes acoustic information, creating challenges in distinguishing sounds and interpreting speech patterns.\n\nHistorical developments in understanding CAPD began during the 1950s, when scientists initially termed it \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking research emerged from Italy, where Bocca and colleagues pioneered diagnostic techniques. The field advanced significantly following Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961, leading to enhanced understanding of the central auditory nervous system's role in sound perception.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD present themselves in various ways. Affected individuals might struggle with spatial sound recognition, experience difficulty differentiating between concurrent sounds, or face challenges in identifying vocal nuances like sarcasm. Some patients report problems with sequential sound processing or demonstrate an inability to effectively synthesize acoustic information for practical use.\n\nDiagnostic procedures for CAPD involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments typically encompass behavioral observations, questionnaire responses, and specialized auditory tests. While no singular diagnostic tool exists as the definitive standard, practitioners often employ multiple simultaneous sound stimuli tests and advanced acoustic response measurements to evaluate patient conditions.\n\nThe absence of a unified diagnostic approach and clear etiology makes CAPD a particularly complex disorder to identify and treat. However, ongoing research continues to enhance our understanding of this condition and improve therapeutic strategies.",
            "My aspiration to enter the field of social work stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for children facing abuse and neglect through the Division of Family and Children Services. The cornerstone principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, maintaining ethical standards, fostering interpersonal relationships, and continuous professional development. These principles resonate deeply with both my professional ambitions and personal convictions.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with various challenges, often resorting to questionable coping mechanisms. This observation led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home environment at a friend's house. The subsequent interaction with law enforcement and the young man's parents, who dismissed serious allegations as \"simple disputes,\" crystallized my calling toward social work.\n\nMy commitment to social advocacy extends beyond professional aspirations. I've long questioned society's paradoxical relationship with individuality - how we simultaneously celebrate uniqueness while enforcing conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I actively challenged societal norms through various forms of self-expression and involvement in social justice initiatives. My participation in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and consistent opposition to discrimination and racism reflect my unwavering dedication to promoting social equity. This commitment to challenging systemic injustices remains integral to my professional mission in social work.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through both biological and sociocultural frameworks. While the biological perspective emphasizes hereditary factors and physiological mechanisms, sociocultural analysis considers environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables. This examination explores these perspectives through current research, evaluating both the merits and limitations of various studies.\n\nSleep disorders fall into distinct categories: primary disorders, those connected to existing mental health conditions, and those stemming from other causes. Primary disorders encompass two main groups: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The former includes conditions like Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and several others, while Parasomnias manifest as behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep, such as night terrors or sleepwalking.\n\nRecent neurological research has revealed fascinating insights into sleep regulation. Scientists have identified specific neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin, which plays a crucial role in sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with rodents have demonstrated that GABAB receptors on these neurons significantly influence sleep patterns. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, they observed increased sleep promotion. Moreover, the administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, resulted in extended sleep duration. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep disorders, particularly regarding genetic predisposition and environmental factors affecting sleep regulation. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, from academic performance to professional capabilities.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating our expansive campus. When I resided in East Halls during my initial year, specifically Stuart Hall, the daily trek to central campus locations like Willard Building would consume nearly half an hour, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast empty spaces - areas now occupied by athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery, and residential complexes. This continuous expansion has exacerbated transportation challenges across campus.\n\nThe optimal solution to this mobility dilemma lies in promoting bicycle usage. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague who rediscovered cycling shared an interesting perspective: \"After dismissing bikes as unfashionable for several years, I've realized they're actually indispensable for campus navigation.\" Beyond the obvious health advantages, bicycles represent the most energy-efficient transportation method - a simple breakfast can fuel extensive travel distances.\n\nCurrently residing off-campus at a distance comparable to some university housing, I consider my bicycle purchase this semester's wisest investment. My daily commute to Thomas Building, typically a 25-minute walk, reduces to merely 5 minutes by bicycle. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my demanding schedule necessitates faster transportation. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 2.5 hours weekly just for Thomas Building commutes, not including other campus destinations - proves invaluable given my packed academic calendar.",
            "In his masterwork Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a dystopian society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes individuality, and instant gratification becomes the primary driving force of human existence. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere pieces in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA close reading through Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about societal development and economic systems. The text employs numerous concepts parallel to Marxist thought, including social uniformity and the transformation of human experience into commodity, suggesting Huxley's commentary on contemporary economic transformations.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of social conditioning mirrors the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. In this society, the lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - are programmed through sleep-learning to embrace consumerist behaviors and hedonistic pursuits. This manipulation, orchestrated by the ruling authority, demonstrates the concept of hegemonic control, where dominant groups maintain power through cultural influence rather than force. The higher castes, despite their enhanced cognitive capabilities, largely accept this system without question, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the novel's depiction of human connections, or rather, their absence. Characters lack psychological complexity, suggesting the dehumanizing effects of technological consumerism. Emotional depth is replaced by superficial interactions - men evaluate women purely on physical attributes, while women discuss intimate encounters with clinical detachment. The rigid social hierarchy, accepted unquestioningly by each caste, reflects Marxist observations about class consciousness, where groups are pacified through illusions of superiority and the constant cycle of consumption and compliance.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a religious studies course focusing on Islamic traditions. The discourse frequently centered on public perceptions of Islam's fundamental nature. This topic remains extraordinarily pertinent in contemporary society. The evolution of media coverage post-September 11th has been fascinating to observe, shifting from initial antagonism toward Islamic communities to what some might consider excessive accommodation. The political landscape has similarly transformed; consider the unprecedented success of candidates with Muslim heritage in American politics.\n\nThe historical accounts of Muhammad's life present some intriguing contradictions. Traditional historical sources often portray military conquests and forceful expansion, yet the biographical texts paint a markedly different picture. These narratives describe a misunderstood spiritual leader who attracted followers through humility and wisdom rather than coercion.\n\nWhat stands out in these biographical accounts are the parallels with other religious traditions, particularly regarding miraculous events. For instance, descriptions of food multiplication ceremonies bear striking resemblance to earlier religious narratives. This pattern of similar miraculous accounts across religious texts raises questions about historical authenticity and the potential appropriation of established religious motifs.\n\nThe biographical sources frequently employ a particular narrative structure, emphasizing voluntary conversions and spontaneous recognition of divine truth. However, the reliability of these accounts becomes questionable when examining their transmission chains. The multiple layers of narration - \"according to person A, who heard from person B\" - while intended to establish credibility, actually diminish the historical reliability of these accounts.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the disparity between the biographical portrayal of Muhammad as an exceptionally humble and peaceful leader versus historical evidence suggesting a more complex figure who effectively utilized military and political power. This raises important questions about historical accuracy and the potential gap between scholarly understanding and popular beliefs within contemporary Islamic communities.",
            "Following Christ's death, the core principles he advocated during his mortal existence were swiftly abandoned as Christian philosophy evolved. Examining the historical trajectory reveals Christianity's gradual deviation from its foundational roots. Contemporary society exhibits increasing enlightenment and unprecedented liberal tendencies. Although conservative elements persist, steadfastly adhering to inherited doctrines, their influence may prove insufficient to shape collective consciousness. The Christian community will likely experience a surge in historical consciousness in coming generations. A collective desire will emerge to separate accumulated theological additions from the authentic intentions of Christianity's founder. Though this transformation may span generations or centuries, its culmination appears inevitable: Christian history will witness a dramatic reversal. A retrograde progression toward its original form will unfold. A groundswell movement will systematically strip away doctrinal layers, effectively rewinding time until solely Jesus' divine message remains, unencumbered by subsequent theological interpretations. As this phenomenon sweeps across Western civilization, inspiring multitudes to embrace Christ's original teachings, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their leadership role. Yet, as theological retrograde occurs, Christianity's current denominational diversity will consolidate toward unified beliefs and practices. Inter-regional, inter-denominational, and other sectarian distinctions will diminish in favor of increasing homogeneity. History demonstrates such reversals: Rome transformed from Christianity's persecutor to its champion; America evolved from enslaving African-Americans to embracing their leadership. Christianity's impending transformation will manifest through theological simplification, seeking original truth while reducing diversity. This evolution requires interpreting Jesus' teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To understand this trajectory, we must examine Christianity's origins. Prior to 63 BCE, when Rome seized Jerusalem, Judaism provided Christianity's theological foundation. Jewish society, embracing monotheism, divine revelation, and Hebrew scripture, was nevertheless fragmented into distinct groups: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through careful analysis of Upton Sinclair's masterwork \"The Jungle,\" one can observe a compelling portrayal of humanity's inherent tendency toward avarice and self-preservation. The narrative expertly demonstrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of authority, prioritize personal advancement while disregarding the welfare of their subordinates.\n\nThis phenomenon manifests most prominently in the industrial magnates who controlled the massive manufacturing enterprises. Their singular focus on expansion and profit maximization led to a callous disregard for collateral damage, whether environmental or human. As Sinclair eloquently illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid imagery underscores the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization, with factory emissions and livestock waste contaminating the surrounding ecosystem with impunity.\n\nThe exploitation extended beyond environmental concerns to encompass labor practices. As one passage notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" In an era devoid of worker protections, management exercised unprecedented control over their workforce, subjecting them to hazardous conditions and arbitrary termination without recourse.\n\nThe absence of regulatory oversight or social support systems left workers particularly vulnerable. While labor unions emerged as a potential solution, they often proved predatory rather than protective. The deplorable conditions faced by workers drew parallels to institutional slavery, as evidenced by Sinclair's observation that \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Among Edgar Allan Poe's poetic works, \"Dream-land\" stands as a notable composition that reveals fascinating literary connections. The recurring mention of \"Thulé\" within this piece has sparked scholarly interest regarding its origins. While traditional analysis points to Virgilian influence, where the term designated a mysterious northern isle beyond Britain's shores, contemporary research suggests alternative inspirations.\n\nThe German literary tradition, particularly through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, emerges as a compelling source. Literary scholar Karl J. Arndt's comparative analysis in his scholarly work about Poe and Goethe's writings identifies striking parallels between their respective compositions.\n\nGoethe, renowned for his masterwork Faust (published in two installments: 1808 and 1832), incorporated \"The King of Thulé\" within its pages. This embedded narrative presents a poignant tale of loss and mortality: a bereaved monarch, clutching a gifted goblet from his deceased queen, surrenders to grief-induced drinking before choosing a dramatic end. The thematic resonance between this account and \"Dream-Land\" suggests more than coincidental similarity, perhaps reflecting shared meditations on mortality and loss.\n\nThe temporal proximity between Grattan's 1842 dramatic adaptation of Faust and Poe's subsequent usage of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" further strengthens these connections. Moreover, Poe's documented appreciation of Tennyson, who himself acknowledged Goethe's influence, establishes additional literary linkages.\n\n\"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share remarkable atmospheric elements: both evoke desolate landscapes, spectral presences, and profound solitude. This spiritual kinship between the works suggests Poe's creative engagement with Goethe's literary legacy, enhanced by the numerous contemporary adaptations circulating in literary circles of the period.",
            "An analysis of potential punitive damages in a California premises liability case:\n\nWhen examining whether punitive damages could be awarded in a slip-and-fall incident at a retail establishment, several key factors must be considered. The incident in question occurred at D&D Markets, where customer Jennifer Palmer sustained significant back injuries after encountering an unremediated applesauce spill.\n\nThe circumstances leading to the incident are particularly noteworthy. Two separate employees alerted the store manager, Paul Martin, about the hazard at 5:00 PM and 5:15 PM respectively. Martin, who was taking his dinner break, dismissed both notifications, stating he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" The accident occurred at 5:30 PM, following thirty minutes of managerial inaction.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 3294(a) establishes that punitive damages may be recovered in non-contractual obligations where the defendant exhibited \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute further defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful or \"despicable\" with \"willful and conscious disregard\" for others' safety.\n\nLegal precedent, particularly Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979), suggests that malicious conduct encompasses situations where defendants recognize probable dangers yet deliberately fail to address them. This interpretation becomes especially relevant given D&D Markets' history of five previous slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 alone.\n\nGiven these circumstances, a court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed. While proving despicable conduct may present challenges, the manager's deliberate inaction despite awareness of both the immediate hazard and the store's history of similar incidents provides substantial grounds for arguing conscious disregard for customer safety.",
            "The emptiness persisted within her consciousness, an enigmatic void that demanded satiation. This peculiar sensation first manifested during her early adolescence, around age fourteen, and maintained its grip well into her seventeenth year. Eventually, she recognized that her yearning centered not on material possessions but on human connection. Curiously, despite numerous admirers and awkward courtship attempts from her male peers, none sparked her interest. This puzzling circumstance prompted frequent self-reflection, though years of introspection yielded no satisfactory explanations for her apparent immunity to teenage romance.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere typically exuded tranquility, courtesy of her remarkably harmonious parents. Conflicts rarely erupted within their household, save for occasional tensions regarding her burgeoning independence. While her parents embodied serenity, she possessed an effervescent spirit that, coupled with her genuine kindness, drew others to her naturally.\n\nThe day's peaceful facade shattered when an agonized cry echoed from the kitchen. Rushing toward the source, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, writhing in evident distress. \"Mom?!\" she called out, heart racing. Between labored breaths, her mother requested immediate medical attention. Drawing upon strength acquired through dedicated training, she carefully lifted her incapacitated parent and transported her to their vehicle.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic environment barely registered as she focused solely on securing assistance. Medical personnel quickly converged, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination. Left alone in the waiting area, she contemplated the simple accident that precipitated this crisis - her mother's unfortunate tumble from a stepstool while reaching for an elevated vase.",
            "Recent research has explored the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns characteristic of Mediterranean regions. The investigation centered on evaluating whether individuals following traditional Mediterranean eating habits - assessed through an adapted scoring system called the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) score - experienced fewer instances of heart disease, stroke, and related mortality.\n\nThe Mediterranean dietary pattern emphasizes abundant plant-based foods, including various fruits, legumes, whole grain products, and tree nuts (though notably excluding potatoes). It also favors fish consumption and olive oil over saturated fats, while limiting animal products. Wine consumption in moderation is considered acceptable within this framework.\n\nEarlier research had already established promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating and reduced overall mortality, particularly from cardiovascular causes. One notable intervention demonstrated superior outcomes in obese participants following Mediterranean guidelines compared to those on low-fat regimens, specifically regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles. However, stroke-specific outcomes remained largely unexplored.\n\nThe researchers tracked 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63 across 11 American states, all initially free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Throughout two decades (1984-2004), dietary habits were monitored via detailed questionnaires administered six times. These food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) underwent rigorous validation, with participant retention exceeding 95%. Health outcomes were meticulously documented through medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, with some cases classified as \"probable\" when complete documentation was unavailable.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the analysis incorporated various lifestyle factors including exercise patterns, body mass metrics, smoking habits, medication use, and hormonal status. The researchers employed cumulative averaging of dietary scores and adjusted for potential confounding variables using sophisticated statistical methods, specifically Cox proportional-hazard modeling.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective effects: women maintaining stricter adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns showed approximately 29% lower risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those least aligned with these eating habits. The study documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths over the 20-year period.",
            "A striking image emerges: Academy Award nominee Ellen Page stands sentinel on a street corner, brandishing a cardboard placard with an enigmatic message about Hitler's supposed presence in Burma. This Southeast Asian nation, formally Myanmar, has languished under military control since a forceful governmental overthrow in 1962. The country's recent history includes significant civil unrest, particularly during 2007, when Buddhist monastics initiated the first major public demonstrations in ten years.\n\nThese peaceful protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" after the monks' traditional garments, gradually attracted widespread civilian participation. Although initially tolerant, the ruling junta's response grew increasingly hostile, culminating in systematic monastery raids and violent confrontations. International media faced severe restrictions, with journalists facing immediate detention. One particularly tragic incident involved Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, who lost his life while documenting a demonstration on September 27th, 2007. While official statistics cite only 13 casualties, military defector Colonel Hla Win suggested the actual death toll reached thousands.\n\nSuch authoritarian suppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine authority to justify absolute power. Similarly, Japanese imperial tradition maintains their rulers' divine lineage. Modern parallels exist in contemporary political structures, including certain American administrative practices involving religious consultation.\n\nHistorical precedents include China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, where peaceful demonstrators faced military intervention. Casualty estimates vary dramatically - government figures suggest 200-300 deaths, while Chinese Red Cross data indicates 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The 1990s Rwandan crisis saw government-backed Hutu militias targeting Tutsi civilians and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution of Jewish populations across Europe serves as another devastating example of state-sponsored violence.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his extensive career and remarkable ability to mold his ensemble's sound. While his piano work remains understated in many compositions, his genius shines through his intricate arrangements that brilliantly highlighted each musician's strengths. He developed musical structures that balanced improvisation with carefully orchestrated segments, allowing soloists to express themselves while maintaining cohesive arrangements that capitalized on individual performers' unique styles.\n\nThe celebrated musician's command of orchestration manifested in his ability to blend diverse instrumental voices into groundbreaking compositions. His profound understanding of each performer's distinctive sound, combined with his talent for ensemble arrangement, resulted in revolutionary jazz compositions that continue to inspire.\n\nMusic scholars frequently reference works like Creole Love Call when discussing innovative vocal techniques in jazz. This composition exemplifies his pioneering approach to using vocals as an instrumental element, free from lyrical constraints. The piece unfolds across six distinct blues choruses:\n\n- First: Interplay between vocals and woodwinds, evolving from smooth to textured\n- Second: A muted trumpet explores melodic variations with blue note emphasis\n- Third: High-register clarinet solo with subtle piano accompaniment\n- Fourth: Full ensemble recreation of opening dialogue between brass and reeds\n- Fifth: Peak intensity with high reed section leads, supported by brass and rhythm\n- Sixth: Return to vocal-reed dialogue featuring instrumental-style vocal techniques\n- Conclusion: Vocal flourish with unconventional trombone ending\n\nThis innovative approach to vocal integration became a hallmark of Ellington's style. Later works like Hot and Bothered further demonstrated his orchestration mastery, featuring remarkable interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scatting. Similarly, It Don't Mean a Thing showcases Nanton's distinctive trombone introduction, exemplifying Ellington's talent for featuring his musicians' unique capabilities.",
            "What drives the evolutionary pathways of living creatures? Can we identify specific factors that channel the direction of evolutionary development? Back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson noted the scientific community's inability to express biological forms through mathematical means - an observation that remains surprisingly relevant today. Recent scientific endeavors have begun incorporating mathematical frameworks to analyze mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution (see work by Raup and Stanley, 1981).\n\nOur research investigates Prunum specimens using mathematical models to understand developmental patterns and evolutionary shifts. By analyzing X-ray images, we extracted numerical data to construct both theoretical and actual shell structures using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). This approach allowed us to explore the theoretical limits of morphological variation within Prunum. We're currently integrating these findings with empirical observations to better comprehend large-scale evolutionary transitions in this group.\n\nConsider a mollusk shell's fundamental structure: it's essentially a tube that spirals through space, completing 360-degree rotations. These spiral segments, called whorls, encircle an imaginary central line - the columella. The growth rate of these whorls varies, with each rotation marked by a line called the suture. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically appears largest, while preceding whorls form the spire. The shell's extremities include the apex (top) and base (bottom), with the aperture serving as the opening for the animal.\n\nShell orientation can be described from multiple angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. Standard presentation shows the shell in apertural view, with the opening facing forward and apex upward.\n\nTo measure whorls accurately, examine the shell from above, locate the initial suture, and draw a reference line across the shell. Count whorls from this line, measuring to quarter-whorl precision.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a sequence of apertures progressing through three-dimensional space as the organism builds its structure. This progression can be tracked by mapping aperture centers and dimensions throughout the shell's growth. Such data enables both visual and mathematical representation, allowing us to model variations in shell development patterns.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's infant and newborn death rates have shown minimal fluctuation. Despite progress in various Millennium Development Goals, including improvements in water access and sanitation facilities, advancements in child and maternal wellness fall significantly behind expected benchmarks for 2015. Several factors contribute to these challenges, suggesting that broad healthcare infrastructure enhancement might prove more beneficial than isolated program-specific initiatives.\n\nStatistics show that approximately 72% of Indonesian births now occur with professional medical assistance. However, this figure includes traditional birth attendants who lack the medical expertise to handle complications, particularly in cases of severe bleeding, which remains a leading cause of maternal fatalities. This statistical improvement, therefore, presents an overly optimistic picture. Furthermore, professional medical treatment for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions has decreased. Available information about post-birth care, though limited, indicates substantial deficiencies nationwide.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% nationally. A stark urban-rural divide exists, with cities reporting 7% cesarean deliveries compared to rural areas' 2%. This disparity highlights significant healthcare accessibility issues across regions. Economic factors also play a crucial role, with a 27-percentage-point difference in healthcare utilization between the most affluent and impoverished segments of society, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant healthcare metrics, policymakers face a fundamental choice between targeted interventions and comprehensive healthcare system reform. While specialized programs offer appealing advantages, including clearer objectives and quicker outcomes, they present notable challenges. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health services and attract healthcare workers away from essential roles. Moreover, multiple parallel initiatives frequently result in redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, particularly in resource management and funding allocation.",
            "Over the last century, the landscape of Popular Music has expanded tremendously, encompassing an ever-growing array of musical styles. Within this vast spectrum, numerous categories have emerged - from hip-hop to blues, from contemporary country to traditional folk - each subsequently branching into countless subdivisions. Among these musical offshoots, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly noteworthy, having evolved into an intricate web of musical expressions over the past four decades.\n\nHeavy Metal's significance stems from its emotional depth and adaptability. While often gravitating toward darker themes, the genre demonstrates remarkable versatility. Shortly after its inception, musicians began exploring its boundaries, leading to an explosion of distinctive sub-styles. This continuous evolution persists today, resulting in an increasingly complex musical taxonomy.\n\nThe contemporary Heavy Metal scene has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics presents a significant challenge. While incorporating elements from various musical traditions, the genre maintains its unique identity. To grasp modern metal's complexity, one must examine it not merely as a musical category but as a cultural phenomenon that has transformed the musical landscape.\n\nMetal's essence lies in its intensity and technical prowess. It pushes boundaries through enhanced volume, aggressive bass lines, and theatrical presentations. Unlike simpler musical forms, metal demands exceptional instrumental mastery from its practitioners. The genre's development was notably influenced by the psychedelic movement of the 1970s, when artists, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal broke new ground by embracing darker emotional territories, contrasting sharply with the lighter themes prevalent in mainstream music. Modern metal continues to draw inspiration from the emotional intensity characteristic of Romantic-era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, often cited as an early metal prototype. Created as a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcases darker themes and drug-influenced narratives, marking a significant departure from their typical style. Its inclusion on the White Album demonstrated the band's ability to venture into heavier musical territory.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, preceding the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, illustrates both a literal dream sequence and symbolizes his personal aspirations. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for acceptance within the artistic community, leading to an internal conflict that defined his creative process. This tension manifested most prominently in The Dream, which embodies his struggle between conforming to established artistic conventions and maintaining his unique creative expression.\n\nUnderstanding this masterwork requires context about its creator's life journey. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau emerged from middle-class origins, with his father operating a successful hardware business. Unlike his contemporaries, he lacked formal artistic training, spending his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - his first marriage to Clémence ended in heartbreak, with eight children lost in infancy and only his daughter Julia surviving. Art became his salvation, offering solace and new purpose. While other artists of his era often depicted idealized rural life, Rousseau's work reflected authentic working-class perspectives and aspirations.\n\nThe artist's desperate quest for recognition becomes more comprehensible considering his circumstances. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of numerous established modern artists. For instance, his career overlapped with Henri Matisse's emergence in the art scene. However, as noted by art critic Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters, these contemporaries pursued drastically different artistic objectives: Matisse actively avoided conventional expression, while Rousseau earnestly sought acceptance from traditional artistic institutions through conventional approaches.",
            "Throughout history, scholars have noted the deep relationship between moral principles and artistic expression, suggesting an inherent connection between what is virtuous and what is beautiful. This observation resonates with classical perspectives, such as the famous lines from Keats's poetry about truth and beauty being one and the same. Unlike scientific knowledge or practical skills, our understanding of both ethics and artistic merit seems to emerge naturally, without formal instruction. These fields focus on describing existing phenomena rather than establishing rigid guidelines.\n\nWhen we examine artistic or ethical evaluation, we find that conventional analysis often falls short of capturing their true essence. Consider how we discuss masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - while we can analyze its technical elements and historical significance, these aspects alone don't fully explain its enduring impact. People often struggle to articulate why they're drawn to particular artworks, frequently prefacing their explanations with statements about indefinable qualities. This suggests that both artistic and moral excellence possess characteristics that defy complete analytical breakdown.\n\nThis perspective aligns with literary theorists who argue that certain truths can only be conveyed through narrative rather than direct statement. The ineffable quality present in both artistic and ethical domains points to their transcendent nature, suggesting a fundamental connection between these two spheres of human experience. The relationship becomes particularly evident in literature, where artistic expression and moral considerations naturally intersect. Literary works engage with value systems in ways that other art forms might not, making them uniquely positioned to explore ethical dimensions. This integration of moral and aesthetic elements in literature reflects how these values function in our lived experience, where they operate on levels beyond pure rational analysis.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a formidable nation, exhibiting cultural diversity that spans from Munich's alpine foothills to the northern maritime city of Kiel. This rich tapestry of traditions extends across the nation, from Cologne's Rhine-side communities to Dresden's historic Elbe riverbanks. The complex mosaic of contemporary German identity reflects its origins from numerous historical groups and ancestral populations.\n\nThe historical territory known as Germania represents the ancient homeland of the German peoples, though the etymology of this designation remains contentious within academic circles. According to historical accounts, the term's origins may be traced to the Tungri tribe, as documented by Tacitus, who noted their earlier designation as \"Germans\" prior to their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. The term \"Germanus\" first appeared in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, borrowed from Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Linguistic scholars propose various etymological roots, including possible connections to ancient weaponry terminology (the \"ger\" spear) or Celtic linguistic origins suggesting \"shouting ones.\"\n\nHistorical documentation from 98 CE, specifically Tacitus's ethnographic study, presents the Germanic peoples as indigenous to their territory, suggesting minimal external genetic influence. He emphasized the region's inhospitable nature, questioning why anyone would voluntarily relocate to such challenging terrain unless it represented their ancestral homeland.\n\nRoman interaction with Germania remained primarily commercial and military in nature. While the empire conducted periodic campaigns into Germanic territories, permanent settlement proved uncommon. Germanic tribes, emerging prominently during the first century CE, established themselves along Roman imperial boundaries, engaging in trade and frequently serving as auxiliary forces within Roman military structures.",
            "Shakespeare's masterpiece \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The dilemma intensifies when one considers the social consequences of unveiling such deceptions - some relationships may weather the revelation, while others crumble under the weight of betrayed trust.\n\nThe narrative raises particularly intriguing questions regarding gender performance and its motivations. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine dress emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy simultaneously isolates her from female companionship and support networks.\n\nThe complications multiply exponentially when her masculine persona proves too convincing. Olivia's passionate declaration - \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138) - demonstrates the dangerous effectiveness of Viola's disguise. Meanwhile, her interactions with Orsino generate their own tensions: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nContemporary audiences might interpret these identity games as Shakespeare's commentary on repressed desires and sexual fluidity. The confusion surrounding Viola/Cesario's identity creates situations where characters must confront their own assumptions about attraction and gender. However, Olivia's character seems less an exploration of latent same-sex desire and more a satirical portrait of superficial attraction. This interpretation gains credence through her seamless transfer of affections to Sebastian and subsequent familial acceptance of Viola: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "Historical accounts frequently highlight the harsh nature of German colonial administration, particularly regarding the atrocities against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, this perspective oversimplifies a complex imperial system that exhibited remarkable diversity across its territories. Educational initiatives, for instance, varied significantly between regions. Following Britain's acquisition of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, administrators discovered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other territories under German administration.\n\nNamibia (formerly South West Africa) tells a markedly different story. While East African territories benefited from government-established educational institutions, Namibian indigenous education relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal state support. Conversely, the administration channeled substantial resources into European education, establishing public schools and providing enhanced support for mission-based institutions serving the settler population. These disparate approaches created lasting educational inequalities. Unlike other former German territories, where literacy rates flourished, Namibia's indigenous population remained largely uneducated. Multiple socioeconomic and political elements contributed to this unique trajectory, which warrants further investigation, particularly considering recent scholarship examining settler-indigenous relations.\n\nThe academic literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, predominantly consisting of German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused primarily on documenting educational structures, while subsequent English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and explored specific educational aspects across different territories. Cohen's research, comparing educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, stands as a pivotal contribution, attributing many distinctive features to South West Africa's substantial settler presence.\n\nThe territory's relatively mild climate, despite its largely desert landscape, attracted significant European settlement. By 1913, South West Africa hosted approximately 15,000 European residents, nearly triple the settler population of East Africa, its closest competitor in terms of European inhabitants.",
            "For nearly six decades, spanning 1836 to 1893, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tension in their bilateral relationship. The relationship reached its most volatile point during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in Mexico's defeat and the subsequent American acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Tensions persisted through various confrontations until shortly before WWI, with fundamental differences in faith, societal norms, and material interests driving the conflict.\n\nNeighboring countries frequently experience such prolonged rivalries. Geographic proximity often catalyzes disputes over resources and territory, as demonstrated by numerous historical examples worldwide. The U.S.-Mexico dynamic mirrors many such border-state conflicts. Research indicates that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba have maintained sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, while other regional countries have generally maintained cordial relationships.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the discord. Much like how 20th-century America opposed totalitarian ideologies, earlier generations harbored strong anti-Catholic and anti-monarchical sentiments. This religious-ideological divide parallels other historical conflicts, such as U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War, though the latter centered on political rather than religious differences. The antagonism partly stemmed from inherited Anglo-Spanish antipathies, complicating early diplomatic efforts between the young nations.\n\nHistorical records document 17 distinct conflicts during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most incidents involved territorial disputes, particularly cross-border raids and frontier-related issues. Both nations eventually deployed military forces to address persistent banditry problems along their shared border.\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic dependence on the United States. By the late 1800s, American priorities shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico, fundamentally altering the relationship's dynamic.",
            "In 2008, a rare medical condition struck without warning, transforming my life overnight. At that juncture, I was practicing nursing - a career path I had selected primarily for its promise of stability, having internalized the common wisdom that healthcare would forever remain a secure employment sector. Despite harboring aspirations in scientific research and journalism, I opted for what seemed the safer route.\n\nThe reality hit hard when, at age 46, I found myself incapacitated and unable to maintain employment. My situation hasn't improved since then. A decade and a half of subsisting on disability benefits has stripped away my material possessions and financial security. Each day presents its own set of challenges, constantly testing my resilience and self-worth. While uncertainty permeates every aspect of my existence, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close companions. Such crises have a way of humbling even the most self-reliant individuals.\n\nLife's unpredictability means we're all susceptible to emergencies, regardless of our preparation level. Some obstacles simply prove too formidable to tackle independently. While I acknowledge the necessity of reducing our dependence on governmental institutions - which have proven increasingly unreliable - I advocate for strengthening community bonds rather than pursuing isolation.\n\nHistorical revisionists often romanticize American individualism, but our nation's true foundation rests on principles of collective support and resource sharing. Consider the westward expansion: success depended on cooperation, not isolation.\n\nPersonal preparedness remains crucial - I maintain emergency supplies, including medical kits, water purification systems, and non-perishable foods. Those with access to land should consider sustainable farming practices. However, equally important is fostering connections within your community. True resilience emerges from the strength of our social fabric, not just our individual preparations.",
            "The origins of Buddhism can be traced back to approximately 500 BCE, when an enlightened individual, later known as the Buddha, emerged from his privileged life as a prince. His philosophical insights eventually developed into what we now recognize as Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism representing its most traditional form. As with any ancient belief system spanning millennia, modern Buddhist practices have evolved considerably from their original form. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual performed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony that, while deeply meaningful to both religious officials and ordinary practitioners, finds no basis in the Buddha's original teachings. Such adaptations extend beyond mere customs to influence fundamental religious principles. The evolution of Theravada Buddhist doctrine, affecting both monastics and lay followers, stems from various influences, some originating within the faith community and others from outside sources, with impacts ranging from constructive to destructive.\n\nTo facilitate this analysis, several key distinctions must be established. Forces of change can be categorized as either originating from within the Buddhist community (internal) or from non-Buddhist sources (external). Additionally, these influences may be classified as either antagonistic - arising from anti-Buddhist sentiment and causing harm - or neutral, having no intentional impact on the faith community, though indirect effects may occur.\n\nUnderstanding Theravada Buddhism requires familiarity with its fundamental principles. Adherents place their faith in three core elements: the Buddha himself, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (religious community). The Dhamma encompasses three collections of sacred texts: narratives of Buddha's teachings (Sutta Pitaka), monastic regulations (Vinaya Pitaka), and philosophical discourse (Abhidhamma Pitaka). Central concepts include the absence of an eternal soul (Anatta), life's inherent challenges (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Comprehending these principles is essential for breaking free from the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and overcoming desire, hatred, and confusion. While lay practitioners follow five basic moral guidelines, religious officials observe numerous additional regulations. The foundation of Buddhist philosophy rests upon three noble truths: the reality of suffering, its origin in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the realm of negotiations, cultural understanding serves as a cornerstone for success. However, we must resist the temptation to oversimplify cultural characteristics. The notion of culture defies simple categorization; it exists as a complex tapestry of beliefs, behaviors, and traditions that resist broad generalizations. Sweeping statements about national characteristics often prove counterproductive. Instead, negotiators benefit from examining how specific cultural elements influence the dynamics at the bargaining table.\n\nWhen engaging with unfamiliar cultural contexts, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own experiences. Effective cross-cultural engagement requires comprehensive research, from historical analysis to understanding contemporary social norms. Rather than attempting to modify or critique another culture, successful negotiators adapt their approach to work within established cultural frameworks. This becomes particularly crucial when operating from a position of reduced leverage or in unfamiliar territory.\n\nCultural distinctions extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its unique cultural identity, manifested through various practices and policies. These differences emerge in workplace expectations, communication styles, and organizational values. For example, corporate environments may range from highly structured to notably flexible. Even within single organizations, cultural variations often exist across geographical locations and operational units. While some societies may present a more unified cultural front, careful observation typically reveals underlying complexity.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides insight into cultural motivations and behaviors. In societies prioritizing group harmony and reputation, negotiators typically avoid actions that might cause public embarrassment. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may focus primarily on securing advantageous terms. While these cultural patterns merit consideration during preparation, successful negotiators also recognize the importance of understanding their counterparts as individuals, moving beyond cultural stereotypes to forge meaningful connections.",
            "Within religious philosophical discourse, we encounter a fascinating dichotomy between two prominent theologians' approaches to proving divine existence. The biblical assertion \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" serves as a launching point for examining these contrasting methodologies. When analyzing the arguments presented by Anselm and Aquinas regarding God's existence, we must operate within their shared theological framework - specifically, the Judeo-Christian conception of deity. Attempting to broaden the scope to encompass alternative divine conceptualizations would undermine our ability to effectively evaluate their respective arguments. However, despite their intellectual rigor, both approaches demonstrate certain limitations in establishing an comprehensive foundation for theological belief.\n\nAnselm's methodology emphasizes introspective revelation, suggesting that divine truth manifests through internal contemplation. His argument posits that our capacity to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence, as the very notion of God within human consciousness validates His reality. This internal validation approach, while perhaps philosophically elegant, relies heavily on subjective understanding and what Christianity traditionally terms \"faith.\"\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions an empirical approach, constructing his argument through observable phenomena and logical deduction. His famous five proofs - addressing change, causation, contingency, gradation, and design - attempt to demonstrate God's existence through rational necessity rather than spiritual intuition. This methodology particularly serves evangelistic purposes, as it provides a framework for conversion based on intellectual persuasion rather than requiring a preliminary leap of faith. Aquinas effectively employs the metaphor of a jigsaw puzzle: one can deduce the characteristics and existence of a missing piece through the logical implications of the surrounding completed sections.",
            "Literary authors employ diverse strategies to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In analyzing \"The Great Gatsby,\" we observe how the author implements various literary devices to achieve his narrative goals. One notable approach involves the unconventional pairing of descriptors with objects, creating unexpected associations. Additionally, the text employs symbolic elements, particularly through a sophisticated color palette including shades of gold, emerald, alabaster/slate, and crimson/rose.\n\nThe novel demonstrates particular mastery in its treatment of chromatic symbolism, especially regarding the alabaster/slate and crimson/rose spectrum. These hues serve as powerful metaphorical devices, subtly influencing readers' perceptions throughout the narrative.\n\nThe alabaster/slate motif consistently represents conformity and social standing, with lighter tones suggesting refinement while darker shades indicate age and decay. This pattern emerges early, as characters frequently appear in pale attire - from the protagonist's companions to party attendees. The sole deviation occurs during the vibrant party sequence, where \"corridors explode with primary pigments.\"\n\nThis color scheme extends beyond fashion, permeating the environment: metropolitan canyons gleam pale, party guest lists fade to graphite, and residential structures resemble \"uniform slices of pale cake.\" The pattern encompasses both individuals and locations: shared childhood memories appear colorless, industrial zones fade to ash, and peripheral characters - from immigrant children to elderly vendors - exist in monochromatic tones.\n\nFollowing this established symbolism, the author leverages these shades to undersign themes of conformity and banality. This technique particularly illuminates the characterization of certain figures, notably the female lead, who repeatedly appears surrounded by pale imagery - her vehicle, attire, and accessories all reinforcing her role as an idealized, yet ultimately conventional, object of desire.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local farms yield an impressive variety of produce, ranging from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh leafy vegetables and aromatic herbs. The region's agricultural bounty extends to stone fruits, various berry varieties, artisanal honey, and diverse pepper cultivars. Local residents demonstrate significant enthusiasm for community-supported agriculture (CSA), particularly organic options, with numerous programs maintaining extensive waitlists. The demand for naturally produced dairy and eggs remains consistently robust.\n\nMany agricultural enterprises in the region have diversified their revenue streams by offering educational tours and recreational activities, including nature walks and wildlife observation. This multifaceted approach enables property owners to leverage governmental assistance while enhancing natural habitats and creating additional income opportunities through various educational initiatives.\n\nWhile organic cultivation methods promote enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem health through chemical-free practices, they present unique challenges. These operations typically demand heightened labor involvement, meticulous pest management, and often experience greater crop losses compared to conventional farming methods. Smaller organic operations also face efficiency disadvantages relative to large-scale industrial farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as implementing cover crops, managing grazing patterns, controlling invasive species, and maintaining specific habitat conditions, introduce further operational complexities and expenses.\n\nThe subject property comprises 160 acres situated near Potrero, within unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The landscape features a mixture of chaparral, non-indigenous Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodland communities. This location falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone, as designated by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The area serves as habitat for numerous protected species, including the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher, among others facing population decline.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples inhabited this region for generations before ranchers and wood merchants established themselves in the nineteenth century. The property's origins trace back to an original homestead grant, suggesting historical usage for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis examined current market listings and available governmental support programs to evaluate viable options for small-scale agricultural operations emphasizing wildlife conservation, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection - particularly brothers - that transcends ordinary relationships. This connection encompasses various sentiments: affection, honor, envy, and sometimes even malice. No one comprehends a brother quite like another brother, as they function almost as mirrors to one another. Critical moments reveal the true essence of their relationship, whether positive or negative, though such revelations often exact a significant toll. Managing the aftermath of brotherly emotions requires careful navigation. When brothers lock eyes, they perceive their authentic selves rather than the facade presented to others. Their genuine nature manifests in their choices and the subsequent results.\n\nThis sibling dynamic takes center stage in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where readers witness two brothers' journey through richly depicted surroundings. Their story culminates in a powerful scene where fierce pride collides with crushing failure, leaving only one survivor. The narrative employs explicit character development of Doodle and illustrates the siblings' relationship through their interactions. The narrator's perspective illuminates the intricate emotional landscape and worldview that shape the story's events.\n\nThe older brother's motivations stem primarily from ego. His initial encounters with Doodle reveal an underlying frustration - he yearned for a companion capable of matching his physical prowess, someone to \"race to Horsehead Landing\" or \"climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" These aspirations proved unrealistic given Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which threatened his very survival and precluded strenuous activities. The protagonist's childhood dreams shattered upon facing this reality. His reaction manifested darkly, even contemplating smothering his infant brother - an unusually sinister thought for a child. Yet Doodle's innocent smile pierced this darkness, suggesting that beneath the resentment lay an inherent fraternal bond. This transformation hints at the superficial nature of his initial hostility.",
            "Our cognitive processor - the brain - functions as an intricate system for managing and interpreting data. Throughout history, people have drawn various parallels to understand its operation, from ancient analogies of wax tablets to modern-day computational devices. Yet we must exercise caution with such comparisons, as they often oversimplify this remarkable organ's true complexity.\n\nThe process of neural interpretation begins when our sensory receptors convert external stimuli - whether tactile, thermal, auditory, or visual - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through dual processing pathways. Consider observing a white canvas containing a dark square: the primary pathway assembles basic elements like hue, alignment, and edge detection to construct the image, while the secondary pathway expedites recognition by utilizing preliminary conclusions from the first process. This dual approach helps distinguish whether we're seeing a dark object against light or a light-colored surface with a square opening.\n\nNeural mechanisms continuously filter incoming data streams, determining their significance and appropriate cognitive destination. While your neural network processes countless environmental details - like individual grass blades beneath your feet - selective attention mechanisms prevent cognitive overload. Yet these same mechanisms ensure critical stimuli, like hearing your name in a crowded space, break through the filter. This selective processing occurs continuously across multiple cognitive levels.\n\nData retention involves various memory systems - immediate sensory recall, temporary working storage, and permanent retention. The encoding process varies by input type. For instance, verbal information storage can occur through visual pattern recognition, sound-based association, or meaning-based interpretation. Retention mechanisms differ by memory type: temporary recall may involve neural circuit loops sustaining information for approximately twenty seconds, while permanent storage likely depends on protein structure modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks explaining knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent theory suggests information exists as interconnected concept nodes, forming association networks. In this framework, related concepts - such as \"desk,\" \"wood,\" and \"furniture\" - form linked neural pathways.",
            "The economic collapse of 2007 marked a devastating period in American history. As businesses shuttered, home values plummeted, and major institutions crumbled, the nation faced its most severe financial downturn since the Great Depression. This catastrophe, which continues to influence our economy, emerged from a perfect storm of misguided policies and complex financial instruments.\n\nAt its core, the crisis stemmed from aggressive lending practices encouraged by well-intentioned but shortsighted political initiatives. Financial institutions, responding to various pressures, began offering risky loans to borrowers who traditionally wouldn't qualify. These loans were then transformed into sophisticated financial products, creating a web of interconnected risks throughout the banking system. When homeowners began defaulting, this house of cards collapsed, sending shockwaves through the global economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were planted during the late 1990s. In an effort to promote homeownership among middle and lower-income Americans, policymakers implemented measures that fundamentally altered lending practices. A prescient 1999 New York Times article by Steven Holmes warned about potential consequences, noting that Fannie Mae faced mounting pressure to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes cautioned that such practices could necessitate government intervention during an economic downturn.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated by financial innovation. Novel mortgage products and complex derivatives proliferated throughout the market. These instruments, including adjustable-rate mortgages and various securitized products, created unprecedented interconnections within the financial system. This heightened complexity left the economy particularly vulnerable to housing market fluctuations.\n\nWhen the bubble finally burst, the carnage was widespread. Major investment banks reported staggering losses, with the top five institutions holding mortgage-related debt equivalent to nearly one-third of America's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of legendary Wall Street firms, while government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, holding $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, required federal takeover by late 2008.",
            "Let's discuss the pitfalls of exposition in storytelling. While it might seem tempting to unleash a torrent of background information, this approach often proves counterproductive. Many writers, myself included, have experienced the frustration of encountering walls of explanatory text that bring narratives to a grinding halt.\n\nConsider exposition as a necessary evil rather than a storytelling tool. Though we're all familiar with the golden rule of \"show, don't tell,\" even experienced authors sometimes succumb to the temptation of information dumping. It's like having two conflicting voices in your head - one pushing you to establish context quickly, the other urging you to detail every minor character's life story.\n\nAt its core, exposition simply conveys information to readers. In movies, you'll recognize it when characters engage in unrealistic conversations purely to inform the audience. Literature employs similar techniques through narrative description.\n\nTo illustrate: imagine reading about a protagonist's whirlwind romance, marriage, and subsequent tragic loss of their spouse - all condensed into two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach robs readers of emotional investment. Instead, effective storytelling would develop the husband's character through meaningful interactions, demonstrate the relationship's impact through specific moments, and allow readers to form genuine connections with both characters. This investment makes the tragedy resonant rather than merely informative.\n\nThe challenge lies in avoiding the temptation to rush through character backgrounds. When introducing someone new - perhaps a former Air Force veteran now managing a gas station, twice divorced, with weekend fishing habits and entrepreneurial dreams - resist the urge to present these details as a simple checklist.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable stories on NBC 4's morning broadcast. The primary coverage centered on a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities arrested Shad Hostettler following an alleged knife attack on his spouse. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nSubsequently, they reported on an incident involving an 18-year-old victim, Travis Buyers, who sustained critical injuries in a shooting at Sharon Woods. Law enforcement, including SWAT personnel, were investigating with no immediate suspects. The limited coverage of this incident appeared to reflect certain media biases in crime reporting, particularly regarding demographic representation in news coverage.\n\nThe broadcast continued with details about an investigation into damage sustained by a Med-Flight helicopter, specifically a perforation from what analysts determined to be a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers announced a substantial $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nA meteorological update followed, projecting afternoon precipitation and temperatures maintaining around 80-85 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend. This segment's concise nature appeared designed to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe coverage included a report about a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, where the description of the suspect received notably detailed attention regarding physical characteristics. The final segment discussed the sentencing of a Texas-based narcotics distributor, Rene Rodriguez, who received a 300-month sentence for marijuana trafficking operations between Texas and Ohio. The peculiar choice of expressing the sentence in months rather than years was particularly noteworthy.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, certain patterns emerged regarding the emphasis placed on demographic information in criminal reporting, raising questions about editorial decisions in news presentation.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. These investment vehicles mirror various market segments while offering advantages typically associated with individual stocks, including short-selling opportunities, margin trading, and single-share purchase options. Despite providing these sophisticated features, ETFs maintain remarkably competitive expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.\n\nInvestors should note that ETF transactions incur brokerage commissions, similar to stock trades. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across various sectors and asset classes. However, prudent investors must conduct thorough due diligence to verify marketed advantages such as diversification benefits and their actual magnitude. This analysis focuses on examining the IHF ETF alongside its primary constituents to assess whether holding the ETF delivers comparable advantages to maintaining positions in its top components, while also exploring potential alternative configurations that might yield superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\nTo maintain analytical clarity, our investigation concentrates on the ten largest holdings, which constitute approximately 63.58% of the fund's total assets. The subsequent analysis details these positions and their respective weightings.\n\nTo evaluate how effectively these ten positions represent the complete IHF ETF, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the corresponding portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns. Detailed calculations appear in the accompanying data set.\n\nAnalysis reveals that constructing a portfolio using only the top ten holdings generates returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points, representing a 16% performance improvement. Additionally, this concentrated portfolio demonstrates a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. These preliminary findings suggest potential advantages in holding the top components directly. However, statistical significance testing becomes necessary to validate these apparent differences.\n\nTo determine statistical distinctiveness between these investment approaches, we calculated normalized standard deviations for each top holding, enabling direct comparison with the ETF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of the participation data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a concerning decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. Multiple factors potentially contributed to this downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our New England institution naturally deterred bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The academic calendar also played a significant role, as December brings final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties, followed by an extended holiday break when campus activity diminishes substantially.\n\nWhile these factors explain certain participation patterns, including January's low numbers coinciding with the spring semester startup, they fail to account for February's unexpectedly minimal submission rate. Such initiatives often experience peak enthusiasm initially, followed by diminishing engagement. To counter this effect, our team implemented a targeted \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, successfully boosting participation rates. Nevertheless, maintaining consistent involvement proved challenging, particularly given the academic calendar's inherent disruptions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative transportation initiatives stems from America's car-centric culture, where personal vehicles represent autonomy and convenience. Our incentive structure included local business gift certificates, covering dining establishments, cafes, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating escalating reward tiers might have sustained higher participation levels. While initial prizes adequately motivated early involvement, introducing progressively valuable incentives - perhaps culminating in major prizes like premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - could have prevented the observed engagement decline. This graduated reward system might have effectively countered participation fatigue and maintained momentum throughout the project's duration.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, encompassing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces employed clever editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns across most productions and some intriguing deviations in later works. The typical trick film from this era exhibited several distinctive characteristics: studio-based settings, theater-style presentation, stationary camera work, broader shot compositions, and single-scene structures. Interestingly, as the century turned, some bold filmmakers began experimenting with multiple-scene narratives.\n\nThese productions consistently utilized indoor studio sets, framed like traditional theater stages. Cameras remained fixed in position, never tracking the performers or props. This staging approach reflected strong influences from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic shows. The static camera setup naturally constrained performer movements to lateral directions, rarely allowing depth-wise motion. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where performers exclusively traverse the frame horizontally, entering stage right and moving across, while the camera maintains its fixed perspective.\n\nThe theatrical influence manifested in the predominant use of wide and occasional medium-range shots. Notably absent from these films were any close-up compositions. This mirrored the live theater experience, where audiences viewed entire performances within the stage's physical boundaries. Performers typically maintained their distance from the camera, operating in the middle ground of the frame.\n\nMost productions adhered to a single-scene format, resulting in brief running times rarely exceeding sixty seconds. This structure naturally limited narrative complexity, with most films showcasing straightforward magical demonstrations, transformations, or vanishing acts rather than developed storylines. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as continuous scenes often involved multiple shots cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate shots were joined to create the illusion of decapitation.",
            "Literary scholars often note the fascinating contradiction inherent in the term \"Gothic Novel.\" As explored in Ian Watt's analysis \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" this genre represents a unique fusion of antiquity and modernity. Throughout its evolution, the Gothic genre has weathered diverse critical reactions - some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nWhen Horace Walpole introduced \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he effectively birthed the Gothic genre by masterfully blending classical theatrical elements with contemporary narrative techniques. His innovative approach, which he simply termed \"A Gothic Story,\" established a new paradigm in literary expression. The genre draws heavily from medieval influences, incorporating elements of theater, architectural motifs, and cultural traditions from that era. Interestingly, by Walpole's time, the term \"gothic\" had accumulated various connotations, often carrying implications of primitiveness when contrasted with contemporary cultural and literary developments.\n\nThe enduring appeal of Gothic literature stems from its unique combination of theatrical grandeur and psychological intimacy - a characteristic made possible by the novel format. This duality allows the genre to maintain relevance across generations while simultaneously feeling both antiquated and fresh to modern readers.\n\nThe concept of chivalry emerges as a central theme in Gothic literature, particularly evident in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Medieval chivalric ideals undergo both preservation and transformation within the narrative. This focus on chivalry reflects contemporary anxieties about moral decay - Walpole, writing during politically turbulent times, appeared to view the medieval period as a lost golden age of virtue. This perspective manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal encompasses traditional knightly virtues while simultaneously exemplifying the Gothic tendency toward dramatic excess.\n\nNotably, Frederic's character embodies quintessential chivalric attributes: his royal status, his profound response to tragedy, and his presumed martyrdom at the hands of infidels all contribute to an idealized portrait of medieval nobility. This characterization, while deliberately exaggerated, serves to highlight the perceived moral gulf between past and present societies.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material processing to final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, represents a comprehensive approach to orchestrating, implementing, and monitoring supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements effectively and swiftly. The framework consists of six fundamental components: production, supply, inventory management, facility location, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nAt the heart of supply chain operations lies production, serving as its cornerstone. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodology of manufacturing processes. Understanding market dynamics becomes paramount, as it provides the clearest indication of consumer preferences and demands. Through careful market analysis and consumer behavior interpretation, decision-makers can determine optimal product mix and quantities. Subsequently, they must identify appropriate manufacturing facilities that can achieve desired volume and quality benchmarks while ensuring customer satisfaction. The production phase concludes with detailed workflow scheduling and equipment maintenance planning. The significance of meticulous planning cannot be overstated; any oversight could result in substantial financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second cornerstone, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Manufacturing operations often encompass multiple specialized divisions, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division allocation for various production phases. Additionally, they might explore external partnerships to enhance operational velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while optimizing cost structures.",
            "The literary landscape of Victorian England, while often associated with meticulous detail and upper-class narratives, produced some remarkable exceptions. Both Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge from these conventional patterns, embracing darker themes and supernatural elements that set them apart from their contemporaries. These works leverage mystery and unconventional storytelling techniques to develop complex character psychologies and emotional depths.\n\nConsider this passage from Oliver Twist:\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nDream sequences emerge as a powerful narrative device in both novels, though each author employs them distinctively. In Oliver Twist, these surreal interludes illuminate the protagonist's psychological state and his subconscious understanding of his circumstances. Chapter 28's shooting scene exemplifies this technique, as Oliver experiences a dreamlike recollection of his trauma. The narrative emphasizes his powerlessness through vivid hallucinations featuring Sikes and Crackit. His sensory perception becomes distorted; the \"unseen hand\" that guides him goes unnoticed, while persistent pain merges with an overwhelming sense of fear. This disorientation raises questions about agency and fate in Oliver's journey. The scene suggests his gradual submission to circumstances, possibly indicating Fagin's successful manipulation of his spirit. The absence of self-preservation instincts in such a dire situation implies a deeper psychological surrender.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.",
            "During my time as a tutor in an elementary after-school program, I encountered a situation that opened my eyes to the complexities of language learning. While assisting students across various subjects, with particular expertise in literacy and English, I was specifically assigned to work with a third-grade student named Adrian who exhibited unusual reading patterns.\n\nInitially, his struggles seemed puzzling - he demonstrated inconsistent letter recognition despite being completely fluent in spoken English. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother during a day when most students were away on a field trip. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root of Adrian's challenges: while he was verbally proficient in English, his foundational understanding of the English alphabet was lacking.\n\nThis experience illuminates a broader educational challenge, particularly prevalent in California's school system, where language barriers manifest in unexpected ways. Even students who appear fully assimilated may struggle with fundamental literacy skills. The solution to such challenges requires a multifaceted approach, incorporating various educational strategies rather than relying on a single method.\n\nResearch demonstrates that dual-language education programs yield superior academic outcomes for all participants, not just English language learners. While implementing comprehensive bilingual education may seem daunting, practical solutions exist. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual, schools can employ specialized bilingual support staff to facilitate learning. This approach ensures that both native English speakers and English language learners receive the benefits of dual-language instruction while maintaining realistic staffing requirements.",
            "Humans have long grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. While some families guide their children through structured religious education in churches or synagogues, others encourage introspective spiritual exploration. The beliefs we inherit from our families often become our initial framework, though many individuals eventually forge their own spiritual paths. Some embrace faith wholeheartedly, while others reject supernatural notions entirely, grounding themselves solely in tangible reality. This spiritual journey, unique to each person, represents our quest to illuminate life's deeper meanings.\n\nI remember that rainy afternoon clearly. Sitting beside my father on our covered porch, cigarette smoke mingling with the humid air, I asked about his preferred bird species. \"A cardinal,\" he replied softly, his gaze fixed on the downpour that overwhelmed our garden's vegetation. His appearance had changed dramatically - clothes hanging loose on his diminished frame, his once-full hair noticeably thinned. Words about his condition remained unspoken between us, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, I silently moved my chair closer, sharing in his contemplation of the summer storm.\n\nThat winter, shortly after I turned twenty-two, he succumbed to his illness. The aggressive treatments had prolonged his life beyond medical expectations, though they merely extended his suffering. My faith wavered during those dark nights, questioning the existence of a benevolent deity who would permit such prolonged anguish. Prayer felt futile, like shouting into an endless void.\n\nMaking a conscious choice, I stayed away during his final moments. The thought of witnessing his last breath seemed unbearable - I preferred preserving memories of his vitality rather than documenting his decline. Understanding him as intimately as I did, I knew he wouldn't want me present for that moment. Instead, I retreated to my bedroom, waiting in isolation for news that never came through a phone call.",
            "Among the earliest champions of Republican ideology stood John Taylor of Caroline, whose agricultural background and limited political experience shaped his passionate advocacy for individual liberties and governmental reform. His agricultural roots profoundly influenced his philosophical framework, particularly regarding governmental structures, constitutional interpretation, and judicial matters.\n\nThe American experiment fascinated Taylor, who recognized its unique position to establish an unprecedented governmental system. Without the constraints of established traditions, he believed America could pioneer genuine self-governance. Taylor emphasized the interconnected nature of fundamental human rights, arguing that these liberties formed an inseparable whole - compromise one, and the entire structure would eventually collapse. Society, he maintained, must transcend the primitive \"natural state\" where physical strength and cunning determined success.\n\nTaylor's vision for an optimal society centered on addressing humanity's dual nature. His framework acknowledged both virtuous and corrupt human tendencies, asserting that \"governmental characteristics mirror human ones.\" He championed principles supporting agricultural development and private property while opposing capitalistic excess. Taylor theorized that properly structured institutions could function effectively despite leadership's inherent self-interest. While he viewed self-interest as a universal motivator, he distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nAs a Constitutional purist, Taylor advocated for precise adherence to the founding document, seeking to restrict federal authority to explicitly granted powers. His concerns about governmental overreach stemmed from fears of costly, potentially tyrannical administration. However, he cautioned against overly literal interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the founders' intent. Notably, Taylor elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more accurate reflection of state sovereignty within the American system.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, taking in the scene below without emotion. With clinical detachment, I observed what lay before me, my thoughts flowing like water - present yet impossible to grasp. The experience felt almost meditative, my consciousness floating above any concrete analysis.\n\nI recalled enrolling in an art course years ago, where the instructor recommended Betty Edwards' Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since childhood, I'd harbored dreams of becoming an artist, and this text promised to unlock those abilities. One particularly useful technique involved using a viewfinder - a simple frame that transformed complex scenes into manageable compositions, like reducing a cluttered kitchen view to just a single bowl of fruit.\n\nBut in this moment, no such framing device could help. The sight commanded my full attention, leaving me transfixed. Great artists are known for their signature periods - Picasso's blues, Monet's gardens, the vibrant palettes of Renaissance Italy. If I were to classify this scene before me, it would surely be my \"Brown Period,\" though not for reasons anyone would celebrate.\n\nWith deliberate movement, I reached for my tool, muscles engaging as I initiated what could have been a masterful stroke. The water moved in elegant spirals, pristine and clear. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. Growing impatient, I jammed the handle down again, but the stubborn brown mass remained steadfast, clinging to the porcelain like a defiant mollusk.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, green tie choking my neck, mop nearby, contemplating this unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron. After several more unsuccessful attempts, I resigned myself to the inevitable. Methodically wrapping my hand in layers of toilet paper until it resembled protective gear, I steeled myself for the unpleasant task ahead, bending forward like someone reaching into an oven, though what awaited was far from a holiday feast.",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among adolescent drivers demands our immediate attention. Research conducted by various institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, reveals a concerning correlation between neurological development and driving capabilities. The underdeveloped adolescent brain, coupled with limited driving experience, contributes significantly to increased incidents of fatal collisions, vehicle overturning, excessive speed violations, and road departures.\n\nStudies from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlight a disturbing pattern linking passenger age demographics to collision frequency. This data becomes particularly relevant when considering the social dynamics of teenage transportation habits.\n\nWhile certain jurisdictions have implemented restricted licensing programs limiting driving hours and passenger capacity, these measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem persists: empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that younger drivers lack the cognitive maturity necessary for safe vehicle operation.\n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman's research, featured in USA Today, suggests that risk-seeking behavior peaks during late adolescence, specifically before age 20. This scientific insight supports postponing full driving privileges until this developmental phase concludes. The urgency of addressing this matter intensifies when considering demographic projections: the children of Baby Boomers will soon reach driving age, potentially introducing millions of inexperienced operators to our roadways.\n\nA comprehensive solution requires standardized national regulations. Educational institutions could maintain their driver education programs, but actual licensing would be restricted to individuals 18 and older. The existing framework of provisional permits and supervised practice hours could remain intact, utilizing current state requirements as a baseline (e.g., California's model of 6 hours of professional instruction plus 50 hours of supervised practice).\n\nGiven that mortality statistics reflect a nationwide pattern, federal oversight would provide consistent protection across all jurisdictions. This proposal builds upon existing regulatory frameworks rather than introducing revolutionary concepts.",
            "An Investigation into Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) represents a fascinating intersection between neurology and auditory function. Unlike traditional hearing impairments, individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing capabilities but struggle with their brain's interpretation of auditory signals. The disorder affects how the central nervous system processes acoustic information, creating challenges in distinguishing sounds and interpreting speech patterns.\n\nHistorical developments in understanding CAPD began during the 1950s, when scientists initially termed it \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking research emerged from Italy, where Bocca and colleagues pioneered diagnostic techniques. The field advanced significantly following Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961, leading to enhanced understanding of the central auditory nervous system's role in sound perception.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD present themselves in various ways. Affected individuals might struggle with spatial sound recognition, experience difficulty differentiating between concurrent sounds, or face challenges in identifying vocal nuances like sarcasm. Some patients report problems with sequential sound processing or demonstrate an inability to effectively synthesize acoustic information for practical use.\n\nDiagnostic procedures for CAPD involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments typically encompass behavioral observations, questionnaire responses, and specialized auditory tests. While no singular diagnostic tool exists as the definitive standard, practitioners often employ multiple simultaneous sound stimuli tests and advanced acoustic response measurements to evaluate patient conditions.\n\nThe absence of a unified diagnostic approach and clear etiology makes CAPD a particularly complex disorder to identify and treat. However, ongoing research continues to enhance our understanding of this condition and improve therapeutic strategies.",
            "My aspiration to enter the field of social work stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for children facing abuse and neglect through the Division of Family and Children Services. The cornerstone principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, maintaining ethical standards, fostering interpersonal relationships, and continuous professional development. These principles resonate deeply with both my professional ambitions and personal convictions.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with various challenges, often resorting to questionable coping mechanisms. This observation led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home environment at a friend's house. The subsequent interaction with law enforcement and the young man's parents, who dismissed serious allegations as \"simple disputes,\" crystallized my calling toward social work.\n\nMy commitment to social advocacy extends beyond professional aspirations. I've long questioned society's paradoxical relationship with individuality - how we simultaneously celebrate uniqueness while enforcing conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I actively challenged societal norms through various forms of self-expression and involvement in social justice initiatives. My participation in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and consistent opposition to discrimination and racism reflect my unwavering dedication to promoting social equity. This commitment to challenging systemic injustices remains integral to my professional mission in social work.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through both biological and sociocultural frameworks. While the biological perspective emphasizes hereditary factors and physiological mechanisms, sociocultural analysis considers environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables. This examination explores these perspectives through current research, evaluating both the merits and limitations of various studies.\n\nSleep disorders fall into distinct categories: primary disorders, those connected to existing mental health conditions, and those stemming from other causes. Primary disorders encompass two main groups: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The former includes conditions like Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and several others, while Parasomnias manifest as behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep, such as night terrors or sleepwalking.\n\nRecent neurological research has revealed fascinating insights into sleep regulation. Scientists have identified specific neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin, which plays a crucial role in sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with rodents have demonstrated that GABAB receptors on these neurons significantly influence sleep patterns. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, they observed increased sleep promotion. Moreover, the administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, resulted in extended sleep duration. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep disorders, particularly regarding genetic predisposition and environmental factors affecting sleep regulation. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, from academic performance to professional capabilities.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating our expansive campus. When I resided in East Halls during my initial year, specifically Stuart Hall, the daily trek to central campus locations like Willard Building would consume nearly half an hour, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast empty spaces - areas now occupied by athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery, and residential complexes. This continuous expansion has exacerbated transportation challenges across campus.\n\nThe optimal solution to this mobility dilemma lies in promoting bicycle usage. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague who rediscovered cycling shared an interesting perspective: \"After dismissing bikes as unfashionable for several years, I've realized they're actually indispensable for campus navigation.\" Beyond the obvious health advantages, bicycles represent the most energy-efficient transportation method - a simple breakfast can fuel extensive travel distances.\n\nCurrently residing off-campus at a distance comparable to some university housing, I consider my bicycle purchase this semester's wisest investment. My daily commute to Thomas Building, typically a 25-minute walk, reduces to merely 5 minutes by bicycle. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my demanding schedule necessitates faster transportation. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 2.5 hours weekly just for Thomas Building commutes, not including other campus destinations - proves invaluable given my packed academic calendar.",
            "In his masterwork Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a dystopian society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes individuality, and instant gratification becomes the primary driving force of human existence. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere pieces in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA close reading through Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about societal development and economic systems. The text employs numerous concepts parallel to Marxist thought, including social uniformity and the transformation of human experience into commodity, suggesting Huxley's commentary on contemporary economic transformations.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of social conditioning mirrors the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. In this society, the lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - are programmed through sleep-learning to embrace consumerist behaviors and hedonistic pursuits. This manipulation, orchestrated by the ruling authority, demonstrates the concept of hegemonic control, where dominant groups maintain power through cultural influence rather than force. The higher castes, despite their enhanced cognitive capabilities, largely accept this system without question, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the novel's depiction of human connections, or rather, their absence. Characters lack psychological complexity, suggesting the dehumanizing effects of technological consumerism. Emotional depth is replaced by superficial interactions - men evaluate women purely on physical attributes, while women discuss intimate encounters with clinical detachment. The rigid social hierarchy, accepted unquestioningly by each caste, reflects Marxist observations about class consciousness, where groups are pacified through illusions of superiority and the constant cycle of consumption and compliance.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a religious studies course focusing on Islamic traditions. The discourse frequently centered on public perceptions of Islam's fundamental nature. This topic remains extraordinarily pertinent in contemporary society. The evolution of media coverage post-September 11th has been fascinating to observe, shifting from initial antagonism toward Islamic communities to what some might consider excessive accommodation. The political landscape has similarly transformed; consider the unprecedented success of candidates with Muslim heritage in American politics.\n\nThe historical accounts of Muhammad's life present some intriguing contradictions. Traditional historical sources often portray military conquests and forceful expansion, yet the biographical texts paint a markedly different picture. These narratives describe a misunderstood spiritual leader who attracted followers through humility and wisdom rather than coercion.\n\nWhat stands out in these biographical accounts are the parallels with other religious traditions, particularly regarding miraculous events. For instance, descriptions of food multiplication ceremonies bear striking resemblance to earlier religious narratives. This pattern of similar miraculous accounts across religious texts raises questions about historical authenticity and the potential appropriation of established religious motifs.\n\nThe biographical sources frequently employ a particular narrative structure, emphasizing voluntary conversions and spontaneous recognition of divine truth. However, the reliability of these accounts becomes questionable when examining their transmission chains. The multiple layers of narration - \"according to person A, who heard from person B\" - while intended to establish credibility, actually diminish the historical reliability of these accounts.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the disparity between the biographical portrayal of Muhammad as an exceptionally humble and peaceful leader versus historical evidence suggesting a more complex figure who effectively utilized military and political power. This raises important questions about historical accuracy and the potential gap between scholarly understanding and popular beliefs within contemporary Islamic communities.",
            "Following Christ's death, the core principles he advocated during his mortal existence were swiftly abandoned as Christian philosophy evolved. Examining the historical trajectory reveals Christianity's gradual deviation from its foundational roots. Contemporary society exhibits increasing enlightenment and unprecedented liberal tendencies. Although conservative elements persist, steadfastly adhering to inherited doctrines, their influence may prove insufficient to shape collective consciousness. The Christian community will likely experience a surge in historical consciousness in coming generations. A collective desire will emerge to separate accumulated theological additions from the authentic intentions of Christianity's founder. Though this transformation may span generations or centuries, its culmination appears inevitable: Christian history will witness a dramatic reversal. A retrograde progression toward its original form will unfold. A groundswell movement will systematically strip away doctrinal layers, effectively rewinding time until solely Jesus' divine message remains, unencumbered by subsequent theological interpretations. As this phenomenon sweeps across Western civilization, inspiring multitudes to embrace Christ's original teachings, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their leadership role. Yet, as theological retrograde occurs, Christianity's current denominational diversity will consolidate toward unified beliefs and practices. Inter-regional, inter-denominational, and other sectarian distinctions will diminish in favor of increasing homogeneity. History demonstrates such reversals: Rome transformed from Christianity's persecutor to its champion; America evolved from enslaving African-Americans to embracing their leadership. Christianity's impending transformation will manifest through theological simplification, seeking original truth while reducing diversity. This evolution requires interpreting Jesus' teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To understand this trajectory, we must examine Christianity's origins. Prior to 63 BCE, when Rome seized Jerusalem, Judaism provided Christianity's theological foundation. Jewish society, embracing monotheism, divine revelation, and Hebrew scripture, was nevertheless fragmented into distinct groups: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through careful analysis of Upton Sinclair's masterwork \"The Jungle,\" one can observe a compelling portrayal of humanity's inherent tendency toward avarice and self-preservation. The narrative expertly demonstrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of authority, prioritize personal advancement while disregarding the welfare of their subordinates.\n\nThis phenomenon manifests most prominently in the industrial magnates who controlled the massive manufacturing enterprises. Their singular focus on expansion and profit maximization led to a callous disregard for collateral damage, whether environmental or human. As Sinclair eloquently illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid imagery underscores the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization, with factory emissions and livestock waste contaminating the surrounding ecosystem with impunity.\n\nThe exploitation extended beyond environmental concerns to encompass labor practices. As one passage notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" In an era devoid of worker protections, management exercised unprecedented control over their workforce, subjecting them to hazardous conditions and arbitrary termination without recourse.\n\nThe absence of regulatory oversight or social support systems left workers particularly vulnerable. While labor unions emerged as a potential solution, they often proved predatory rather than protective. The deplorable conditions faced by workers drew parallels to institutional slavery, as evidenced by Sinclair's observation that \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Among Edgar Allan Poe's poetic works, \"Dream-land\" stands as a notable composition that reveals fascinating literary connections. The recurring mention of \"Thulé\" within this piece has sparked scholarly interest regarding its origins. While traditional analysis points to Virgilian influence, where the term designated a mysterious northern isle beyond Britain's shores, contemporary research suggests alternative inspirations.\n\nThe German literary tradition, particularly through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, emerges as a compelling source. Literary scholar Karl J. Arndt's comparative analysis in his scholarly work about Poe and Goethe's writings identifies striking parallels between their respective compositions.\n\nGoethe, renowned for his masterwork Faust (published in two installments: 1808 and 1832), incorporated \"The King of Thulé\" within its pages. This embedded narrative presents a poignant tale of loss and mortality: a bereaved monarch, clutching a gifted goblet from his deceased queen, surrenders to grief-induced drinking before choosing a dramatic end. The thematic resonance between this account and \"Dream-Land\" suggests more than coincidental similarity, perhaps reflecting shared meditations on mortality and loss.\n\nThe temporal proximity between Grattan's 1842 dramatic adaptation of Faust and Poe's subsequent usage of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" further strengthens these connections. Moreover, Poe's documented appreciation of Tennyson, who himself acknowledged Goethe's influence, establishes additional literary linkages.\n\n\"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share remarkable atmospheric elements: both evoke desolate landscapes, spectral presences, and profound solitude. This spiritual kinship between the works suggests Poe's creative engagement with Goethe's literary legacy, enhanced by the numerous contemporary adaptations circulating in literary circles of the period.",
            "An analysis of potential punitive damages in a California premises liability case:\n\nWhen examining whether punitive damages could be awarded in a slip-and-fall incident at a retail establishment, several key factors must be considered. The incident in question occurred at D&D Markets, where customer Jennifer Palmer sustained significant back injuries after encountering an unremediated applesauce spill.\n\nThe circumstances leading to the incident are particularly noteworthy. Two separate employees alerted the store manager, Paul Martin, about the hazard at 5:00 PM and 5:15 PM respectively. Martin, who was taking his dinner break, dismissed both notifications, stating he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" The accident occurred at 5:30 PM, following thirty minutes of managerial inaction.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 3294(a) establishes that punitive damages may be recovered in non-contractual obligations where the defendant exhibited \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute further defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful or \"despicable\" with \"willful and conscious disregard\" for others' safety.\n\nLegal precedent, particularly Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979), suggests that malicious conduct encompasses situations where defendants recognize probable dangers yet deliberately fail to address them. This interpretation becomes especially relevant given D&D Markets' history of five previous slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 alone.\n\nGiven these circumstances, a court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed. While proving despicable conduct may present challenges, the manager's deliberate inaction despite awareness of both the immediate hazard and the store's history of similar incidents provides substantial grounds for arguing conscious disregard for customer safety.",
            "The emptiness persisted within her consciousness, an enigmatic void that demanded satiation. This peculiar sensation first manifested during her early adolescence, around age fourteen, and maintained its grip well into her seventeenth year. Eventually, she recognized that her yearning centered not on material possessions but on human connection. Curiously, despite numerous admirers and awkward courtship attempts from her male peers, none sparked her interest. This puzzling circumstance prompted frequent self-reflection, though years of introspection yielded no satisfactory explanations for her apparent immunity to teenage romance.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere typically exuded tranquility, courtesy of her remarkably harmonious parents. Conflicts rarely erupted within their household, save for occasional tensions regarding her burgeoning independence. While her parents embodied serenity, she possessed an effervescent spirit that, coupled with her genuine kindness, drew others to her naturally.\n\nThe day's peaceful facade shattered when an agonized cry echoed from the kitchen. Rushing toward the source, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, writhing in evident distress. \"Mom?!\" she called out, heart racing. Between labored breaths, her mother requested immediate medical attention. Drawing upon strength acquired through dedicated training, she carefully lifted her incapacitated parent and transported her to their vehicle.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic environment barely registered as she focused solely on securing assistance. Medical personnel quickly converged, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination. Left alone in the waiting area, she contemplated the simple accident that precipitated this crisis - her mother's unfortunate tumble from a stepstool while reaching for an elevated vase.",
            "Recent research has explored the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns characteristic of Mediterranean regions. The investigation centered on evaluating whether individuals following traditional Mediterranean eating habits - assessed through an adapted scoring system called the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) score - experienced fewer instances of heart disease, stroke, and related mortality.\n\nThe Mediterranean dietary pattern emphasizes abundant plant-based foods, including various fruits, legumes, whole grain products, and tree nuts (though notably excluding potatoes). It also favors fish consumption and olive oil over saturated fats, while limiting animal products. Wine consumption in moderation is considered acceptable within this framework.\n\nEarlier research had already established promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating and reduced overall mortality, particularly from cardiovascular causes. One notable intervention demonstrated superior outcomes in obese participants following Mediterranean guidelines compared to those on low-fat regimens, specifically regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles. However, stroke-specific outcomes remained largely unexplored.\n\nThe researchers tracked 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63 across 11 American states, all initially free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Throughout two decades (1984-2004), dietary habits were monitored via detailed questionnaires administered six times. These food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) underwent rigorous validation, with participant retention exceeding 95%. Health outcomes were meticulously documented through medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, with some cases classified as \"probable\" when complete documentation was unavailable.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the analysis incorporated various lifestyle factors including exercise patterns, body mass metrics, smoking habits, medication use, and hormonal status. The researchers employed cumulative averaging of dietary scores and adjusted for potential confounding variables using sophisticated statistical methods, specifically Cox proportional-hazard modeling.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective effects: women maintaining stricter adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns showed approximately 29% lower risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those least aligned with these eating habits. The study documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths over the 20-year period.",
            "A striking image emerges: Academy Award nominee Ellen Page stands sentinel on a street corner, brandishing a cardboard placard with an enigmatic message about Hitler's supposed presence in Burma. This Southeast Asian nation, formally Myanmar, has languished under military control since a forceful governmental overthrow in 1962. The country's recent history includes significant civil unrest, particularly during 2007, when Buddhist monastics initiated the first major public demonstrations in ten years.\n\nThese peaceful protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" after the monks' traditional garments, gradually attracted widespread civilian participation. Although initially tolerant, the ruling junta's response grew increasingly hostile, culminating in systematic monastery raids and violent confrontations. International media faced severe restrictions, with journalists facing immediate detention. One particularly tragic incident involved Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, who lost his life while documenting a demonstration on September 27th, 2007. While official statistics cite only 13 casualties, military defector Colonel Hla Win suggested the actual death toll reached thousands.\n\nSuch authoritarian suppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine authority to justify absolute power. Similarly, Japanese imperial tradition maintains their rulers' divine lineage. Modern parallels exist in contemporary political structures, including certain American administrative practices involving religious consultation.\n\nHistorical precedents include China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, where peaceful demonstrators faced military intervention. Casualty estimates vary dramatically - government figures suggest 200-300 deaths, while Chinese Red Cross data indicates 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The 1990s Rwandan crisis saw government-backed Hutu militias targeting Tutsi civilians and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution of Jewish populations across Europe serves as another devastating example of state-sponsored violence.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his extensive career and remarkable ability to mold his ensemble's sound. While his piano work remains understated in many compositions, his genius shines through his intricate arrangements that brilliantly highlighted each musician's strengths. He developed musical structures that balanced improvisation with carefully orchestrated segments, allowing soloists to express themselves while maintaining cohesive arrangements that capitalized on individual performers' unique styles.\n\nThe celebrated musician's command of orchestration manifested in his ability to blend diverse instrumental voices into groundbreaking compositions. His profound understanding of each performer's distinctive sound, combined with his talent for ensemble arrangement, resulted in revolutionary jazz compositions that continue to inspire.\n\nMusic scholars frequently reference works like Creole Love Call when discussing innovative vocal techniques in jazz. This composition exemplifies his pioneering approach to using vocals as an instrumental element, free from lyrical constraints. The piece unfolds across six distinct blues choruses:\n\n- First: Interplay between vocals and woodwinds, evolving from smooth to textured\n- Second: A muted trumpet explores melodic variations with blue note emphasis\n- Third: High-register clarinet solo with subtle piano accompaniment\n- Fourth: Full ensemble recreation of opening dialogue between brass and reeds\n- Fifth: Peak intensity with high reed section leads, supported by brass and rhythm\n- Sixth: Return to vocal-reed dialogue featuring instrumental-style vocal techniques\n- Conclusion: Vocal flourish with unconventional trombone ending\n\nThis innovative approach to vocal integration became a hallmark of Ellington's style. Later works like Hot and Bothered further demonstrated his orchestration mastery, featuring remarkable interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scatting. Similarly, It Don't Mean a Thing showcases Nanton's distinctive trombone introduction, exemplifying Ellington's talent for featuring his musicians' unique capabilities.",
            "What drives the evolutionary pathways of living creatures? Can we identify specific factors that channel the direction of evolutionary development? Back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson noted the scientific community's inability to express biological forms through mathematical means - an observation that remains surprisingly relevant today. Recent scientific endeavors have begun incorporating mathematical frameworks to analyze mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution (see work by Raup and Stanley, 1981).\n\nOur research investigates Prunum specimens using mathematical models to understand developmental patterns and evolutionary shifts. By analyzing X-ray images, we extracted numerical data to construct both theoretical and actual shell structures using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). This approach allowed us to explore the theoretical limits of morphological variation within Prunum. We're currently integrating these findings with empirical observations to better comprehend large-scale evolutionary transitions in this group.\n\nConsider a mollusk shell's fundamental structure: it's essentially a tube that spirals through space, completing 360-degree rotations. These spiral segments, called whorls, encircle an imaginary central line - the columella. The growth rate of these whorls varies, with each rotation marked by a line called the suture. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically appears largest, while preceding whorls form the spire. The shell's extremities include the apex (top) and base (bottom), with the aperture serving as the opening for the animal.\n\nShell orientation can be described from multiple angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. Standard presentation shows the shell in apertural view, with the opening facing forward and apex upward.\n\nTo measure whorls accurately, examine the shell from above, locate the initial suture, and draw a reference line across the shell. Count whorls from this line, measuring to quarter-whorl precision.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a sequence of apertures progressing through three-dimensional space as the organism builds its structure. This progression can be tracked by mapping aperture centers and dimensions throughout the shell's growth. Such data enables both visual and mathematical representation, allowing us to model variations in shell development patterns.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's infant and newborn death rates have shown minimal fluctuation. Despite progress in various Millennium Development Goals, including improvements in water access and sanitation facilities, advancements in child and maternal wellness fall significantly behind expected benchmarks for 2015. Several factors contribute to these challenges, suggesting that broad healthcare infrastructure enhancement might prove more beneficial than isolated program-specific initiatives.\n\nStatistics show that approximately 72% of Indonesian births now occur with professional medical assistance. However, this figure includes traditional birth attendants who lack the medical expertise to handle complications, particularly in cases of severe bleeding, which remains a leading cause of maternal fatalities. This statistical improvement, therefore, presents an overly optimistic picture. Furthermore, professional medical treatment for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions has decreased. Available information about post-birth care, though limited, indicates substantial deficiencies nationwide.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% nationally. A stark urban-rural divide exists, with cities reporting 7% cesarean deliveries compared to rural areas' 2%. This disparity highlights significant healthcare accessibility issues across regions. Economic factors also play a crucial role, with a 27-percentage-point difference in healthcare utilization between the most affluent and impoverished segments of society, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant healthcare metrics, policymakers face a fundamental choice between targeted interventions and comprehensive healthcare system reform. While specialized programs offer appealing advantages, including clearer objectives and quicker outcomes, they present notable challenges. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health services and attract healthcare workers away from essential roles. Moreover, multiple parallel initiatives frequently result in redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, particularly in resource management and funding allocation.",
            "Over the last century, the landscape of Popular Music has expanded tremendously, encompassing an ever-growing array of musical styles. Within this vast spectrum, numerous categories have emerged - from hip-hop to blues, from contemporary country to traditional folk - each subsequently branching into countless subdivisions. Among these musical offshoots, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly noteworthy, having evolved into an intricate web of musical expressions over the past four decades.\n\nHeavy Metal's significance stems from its emotional depth and adaptability. While often gravitating toward darker themes, the genre demonstrates remarkable versatility. Shortly after its inception, musicians began exploring its boundaries, leading to an explosion of distinctive sub-styles. This continuous evolution persists today, resulting in an increasingly complex musical taxonomy.\n\nThe contemporary Heavy Metal scene has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics presents a significant challenge. While incorporating elements from various musical traditions, the genre maintains its unique identity. To grasp modern metal's complexity, one must examine it not merely as a musical category but as a cultural phenomenon that has transformed the musical landscape.\n\nMetal's essence lies in its intensity and technical prowess. It pushes boundaries through enhanced volume, aggressive bass lines, and theatrical presentations. Unlike simpler musical forms, metal demands exceptional instrumental mastery from its practitioners. The genre's development was notably influenced by the psychedelic movement of the 1970s, when artists, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal broke new ground by embracing darker emotional territories, contrasting sharply with the lighter themes prevalent in mainstream music. Modern metal continues to draw inspiration from the emotional intensity characteristic of Romantic-era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, often cited as an early metal prototype. Created as a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcases darker themes and drug-influenced narratives, marking a significant departure from their typical style. Its inclusion on the White Album demonstrated the band's ability to venture into heavier musical territory.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, preceding the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, illustrates both a literal dream sequence and symbolizes his personal aspirations. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for acceptance within the artistic community, leading to an internal conflict that defined his creative process. This tension manifested most prominently in The Dream, which embodies his struggle between conforming to established artistic conventions and maintaining his unique creative expression.\n\nUnderstanding this masterwork requires context about its creator's life journey. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau emerged from middle-class origins, with his father operating a successful hardware business. Unlike his contemporaries, he lacked formal artistic training, spending his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - his first marriage to Clémence ended in heartbreak, with eight children lost in infancy and only his daughter Julia surviving. Art became his salvation, offering solace and new purpose. While other artists of his era often depicted idealized rural life, Rousseau's work reflected authentic working-class perspectives and aspirations.\n\nThe artist's desperate quest for recognition becomes more comprehensible considering his circumstances. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of numerous established modern artists. For instance, his career overlapped with Henri Matisse's emergence in the art scene. However, as noted by art critic Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters, these contemporaries pursued drastically different artistic objectives: Matisse actively avoided conventional expression, while Rousseau earnestly sought acceptance from traditional artistic institutions through conventional approaches.",
            "Throughout history, scholars have noted the deep relationship between moral principles and artistic expression, suggesting an inherent connection between what is virtuous and what is beautiful. This observation resonates with classical perspectives, such as the famous lines from Keats's poetry about truth and beauty being one and the same. Unlike scientific knowledge or practical skills, our understanding of both ethics and artistic merit seems to emerge naturally, without formal instruction. These fields focus on describing existing phenomena rather than establishing rigid guidelines.\n\nWhen we examine artistic or ethical evaluation, we find that conventional analysis often falls short of capturing their true essence. Consider how we discuss masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - while we can analyze its technical elements and historical significance, these aspects alone don't fully explain its enduring impact. People often struggle to articulate why they're drawn to particular artworks, frequently prefacing their explanations with statements about indefinable qualities. This suggests that both artistic and moral excellence possess characteristics that defy complete analytical breakdown.\n\nThis perspective aligns with literary theorists who argue that certain truths can only be conveyed through narrative rather than direct statement. The ineffable quality present in both artistic and ethical domains points to their transcendent nature, suggesting a fundamental connection between these two spheres of human experience. The relationship becomes particularly evident in literature, where artistic expression and moral considerations naturally intersect. Literary works engage with value systems in ways that other art forms might not, making them uniquely positioned to explore ethical dimensions. This integration of moral and aesthetic elements in literature reflects how these values function in our lived experience, where they operate on levels beyond pure rational analysis.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a formidable nation, exhibiting cultural diversity that spans from Munich's alpine foothills to the northern maritime city of Kiel. This rich tapestry of traditions extends across the nation, from Cologne's Rhine-side communities to Dresden's historic Elbe riverbanks. The complex mosaic of contemporary German identity reflects its origins from numerous historical groups and ancestral populations.\n\nThe historical territory known as Germania represents the ancient homeland of the German peoples, though the etymology of this designation remains contentious within academic circles. According to historical accounts, the term's origins may be traced to the Tungri tribe, as documented by Tacitus, who noted their earlier designation as \"Germans\" prior to their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. The term \"Germanus\" first appeared in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, borrowed from Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Linguistic scholars propose various etymological roots, including possible connections to ancient weaponry terminology (the \"ger\" spear) or Celtic linguistic origins suggesting \"shouting ones.\"\n\nHistorical documentation from 98 CE, specifically Tacitus's ethnographic study, presents the Germanic peoples as indigenous to their territory, suggesting minimal external genetic influence. He emphasized the region's inhospitable nature, questioning why anyone would voluntarily relocate to such challenging terrain unless it represented their ancestral homeland.\n\nRoman interaction with Germania remained primarily commercial and military in nature. While the empire conducted periodic campaigns into Germanic territories, permanent settlement proved uncommon. Germanic tribes, emerging prominently during the first century CE, established themselves along Roman imperial boundaries, engaging in trade and frequently serving as auxiliary forces within Roman military structures.",
            "Shakespeare's masterpiece \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The dilemma intensifies when one considers the social consequences of unveiling such deceptions - some relationships may weather the revelation, while others crumble under the weight of betrayed trust.\n\nThe narrative raises particularly intriguing questions regarding gender performance and its motivations. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine dress emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy simultaneously isolates her from female companionship and support networks.\n\nThe complications multiply exponentially when her masculine persona proves too convincing. Olivia's passionate declaration - \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138) - demonstrates the dangerous effectiveness of Viola's disguise. Meanwhile, her interactions with Orsino generate their own tensions: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nContemporary audiences might interpret these identity games as Shakespeare's commentary on repressed desires and sexual fluidity. The confusion surrounding Viola/Cesario's identity creates situations where characters must confront their own assumptions about attraction and gender. However, Olivia's character seems less an exploration of latent same-sex desire and more a satirical portrait of superficial attraction. This interpretation gains credence through her seamless transfer of affections to Sebastian and subsequent familial acceptance of Viola: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "Historical accounts frequently highlight the harsh nature of German colonial administration, particularly regarding the atrocities against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, this perspective oversimplifies a complex imperial system that exhibited remarkable diversity across its territories. Educational initiatives, for instance, varied significantly between regions. Following Britain's acquisition of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, administrators discovered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other territories under German administration.\n\nNamibia (formerly South West Africa) tells a markedly different story. While East African territories benefited from government-established educational institutions, Namibian indigenous education relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal state support. Conversely, the administration channeled substantial resources into European education, establishing public schools and providing enhanced support for mission-based institutions serving the settler population. These disparate approaches created lasting educational inequalities. Unlike other former German territories, where literacy rates flourished, Namibia's indigenous population remained largely uneducated. Multiple socioeconomic and political elements contributed to this unique trajectory, which warrants further investigation, particularly considering recent scholarship examining settler-indigenous relations.\n\nThe academic literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, predominantly consisting of German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused primarily on documenting educational structures, while subsequent English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and explored specific educational aspects across different territories. Cohen's research, comparing educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, stands as a pivotal contribution, attributing many distinctive features to South West Africa's substantial settler presence.\n\nThe territory's relatively mild climate, despite its largely desert landscape, attracted significant European settlement. By 1913, South West Africa hosted approximately 15,000 European residents, nearly triple the settler population of East Africa, its closest competitor in terms of European inhabitants.",
            "For nearly six decades, spanning 1836 to 1893, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tension in their bilateral relationship. The relationship reached its most volatile point during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in Mexico's defeat and the subsequent American acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Tensions persisted through various confrontations until shortly before WWI, with fundamental differences in faith, societal norms, and material interests driving the conflict.\n\nNeighboring countries frequently experience such prolonged rivalries. Geographic proximity often catalyzes disputes over resources and territory, as demonstrated by numerous historical examples worldwide. The U.S.-Mexico dynamic mirrors many such border-state conflicts. Research indicates that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba have maintained sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, while other regional countries have generally maintained cordial relationships.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the discord. Much like how 20th-century America opposed totalitarian ideologies, earlier generations harbored strong anti-Catholic and anti-monarchical sentiments. This religious-ideological divide parallels other historical conflicts, such as U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War, though the latter centered on political rather than religious differences. The antagonism partly stemmed from inherited Anglo-Spanish antipathies, complicating early diplomatic efforts between the young nations.\n\nHistorical records document 17 distinct conflicts during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most incidents involved territorial disputes, particularly cross-border raids and frontier-related issues. Both nations eventually deployed military forces to address persistent banditry problems along their shared border.\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic dependence on the United States. By the late 1800s, American priorities shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico, fundamentally altering the relationship's dynamic.",
            "In 2008, a rare medical condition struck without warning, transforming my life overnight. At that juncture, I was practicing nursing - a career path I had selected primarily for its promise of stability, having internalized the common wisdom that healthcare would forever remain a secure employment sector. Despite harboring aspirations in scientific research and journalism, I opted for what seemed the safer route.\n\nThe reality hit hard when, at age 46, I found myself incapacitated and unable to maintain employment. My situation hasn't improved since then. A decade and a half of subsisting on disability benefits has stripped away my material possessions and financial security. Each day presents its own set of challenges, constantly testing my resilience and self-worth. While uncertainty permeates every aspect of my existence, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close companions. Such crises have a way of humbling even the most self-reliant individuals.\n\nLife's unpredictability means we're all susceptible to emergencies, regardless of our preparation level. Some obstacles simply prove too formidable to tackle independently. While I acknowledge the necessity of reducing our dependence on governmental institutions - which have proven increasingly unreliable - I advocate for strengthening community bonds rather than pursuing isolation.\n\nHistorical revisionists often romanticize American individualism, but our nation's true foundation rests on principles of collective support and resource sharing. Consider the westward expansion: success depended on cooperation, not isolation.\n\nPersonal preparedness remains crucial - I maintain emergency supplies, including medical kits, water purification systems, and non-perishable foods. Those with access to land should consider sustainable farming practices. However, equally important is fostering connections within your community. True resilience emerges from the strength of our social fabric, not just our individual preparations.",
            "The origins of Buddhism can be traced back to approximately 500 BCE, when an enlightened individual, later known as the Buddha, emerged from his privileged life as a prince. His philosophical insights eventually developed into what we now recognize as Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism representing its most traditional form. As with any ancient belief system spanning millennia, modern Buddhist practices have evolved considerably from their original form. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual performed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony that, while deeply meaningful to both religious officials and ordinary practitioners, finds no basis in the Buddha's original teachings. Such adaptations extend beyond mere customs to influence fundamental religious principles. The evolution of Theravada Buddhist doctrine, affecting both monastics and lay followers, stems from various influences, some originating within the faith community and others from outside sources, with impacts ranging from constructive to destructive.\n\nTo facilitate this analysis, several key distinctions must be established. Forces of change can be categorized as either originating from within the Buddhist community (internal) or from non-Buddhist sources (external). Additionally, these influences may be classified as either antagonistic - arising from anti-Buddhist sentiment and causing harm - or neutral, having no intentional impact on the faith community, though indirect effects may occur.\n\nUnderstanding Theravada Buddhism requires familiarity with its fundamental principles. Adherents place their faith in three core elements: the Buddha himself, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (religious community). The Dhamma encompasses three collections of sacred texts: narratives of Buddha's teachings (Sutta Pitaka), monastic regulations (Vinaya Pitaka), and philosophical discourse (Abhidhamma Pitaka). Central concepts include the absence of an eternal soul (Anatta), life's inherent challenges (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Comprehending these principles is essential for breaking free from the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and overcoming desire, hatred, and confusion. While lay practitioners follow five basic moral guidelines, religious officials observe numerous additional regulations. The foundation of Buddhist philosophy rests upon three noble truths: the reality of suffering, its origin in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In the realm of negotiations, cultural understanding serves as a cornerstone for success. However, we must resist the temptation to oversimplify cultural characteristics. The notion of culture defies simple categorization; it exists as a complex tapestry of beliefs, behaviors, and traditions that resist broad generalizations. Sweeping statements about national characteristics often prove counterproductive. Instead, negotiators benefit from examining how specific cultural elements influence the dynamics at the bargaining table.\n\nWhen engaging with unfamiliar cultural contexts, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own experiences. Effective cross-cultural engagement requires comprehensive research, from historical analysis to understanding contemporary social norms. Rather than attempting to modify or critique another culture, successful negotiators adapt their approach to work within established cultural frameworks. This becomes particularly crucial when operating from a position of reduced leverage or in unfamiliar territory.\n\nCultural distinctions extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each corporation develops its unique cultural identity, manifested through various practices and policies. These differences emerge in workplace expectations, communication styles, and organizational values. For example, corporate environments may range from highly structured to notably flexible. Even within single organizations, cultural variations often exist across geographical locations and operational units. While some societies may present a more unified cultural front, careful observation typically reveals underlying complexity.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides insight into cultural motivations and behaviors. In societies prioritizing group harmony and reputation, negotiators typically avoid actions that might cause public embarrassment. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures may focus primarily on securing advantageous terms. While these cultural patterns merit consideration during preparation, successful negotiators also recognize the importance of understanding their counterparts as individuals, moving beyond cultural stereotypes to forge meaningful connections.",
            "Within religious philosophical discourse, we encounter a fascinating dichotomy between two prominent theologians' approaches to proving divine existence. The biblical assertion \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" serves as a launching point for examining these contrasting methodologies. When analyzing the arguments presented by Anselm and Aquinas regarding God's existence, we must operate within their shared theological framework - specifically, the Judeo-Christian conception of deity. Attempting to broaden the scope to encompass alternative divine conceptualizations would undermine our ability to effectively evaluate their respective arguments. However, despite their intellectual rigor, both approaches demonstrate certain limitations in establishing an comprehensive foundation for theological belief.\n\nAnselm's methodology emphasizes introspective revelation, suggesting that divine truth manifests through internal contemplation. His argument posits that our capacity to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence, as the very notion of God within human consciousness validates His reality. This internal validation approach, while perhaps philosophically elegant, relies heavily on subjective understanding and what Christianity traditionally terms \"faith.\"\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions an empirical approach, constructing his argument through observable phenomena and logical deduction. His famous five proofs - addressing change, causation, contingency, gradation, and design - attempt to demonstrate God's existence through rational necessity rather than spiritual intuition. This methodology particularly serves evangelistic purposes, as it provides a framework for conversion based on intellectual persuasion rather than requiring a preliminary leap of faith. Aquinas effectively employs the metaphor of a jigsaw puzzle: one can deduce the characteristics and existence of a missing piece through the logical implications of the surrounding completed sections.",
            "Literary authors employ diverse strategies to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In analyzing \"The Great Gatsby,\" we observe how the author implements various literary devices to achieve his narrative goals. One notable approach involves the unconventional pairing of descriptors with objects, creating unexpected associations. Additionally, the text employs symbolic elements, particularly through a sophisticated color palette including shades of gold, emerald, alabaster/slate, and crimson/rose.\n\nThe novel demonstrates particular mastery in its treatment of chromatic symbolism, especially regarding the alabaster/slate and crimson/rose spectrum. These hues serve as powerful metaphorical devices, subtly influencing readers' perceptions throughout the narrative.\n\nThe alabaster/slate motif consistently represents conformity and social standing, with lighter tones suggesting refinement while darker shades indicate age and decay. This pattern emerges early, as characters frequently appear in pale attire - from the protagonist's companions to party attendees. The sole deviation occurs during the vibrant party sequence, where \"corridors explode with primary pigments.\"\n\nThis color scheme extends beyond fashion, permeating the environment: metropolitan canyons gleam pale, party guest lists fade to graphite, and residential structures resemble \"uniform slices of pale cake.\" The pattern encompasses both individuals and locations: shared childhood memories appear colorless, industrial zones fade to ash, and peripheral characters - from immigrant children to elderly vendors - exist in monochromatic tones.\n\nFollowing this established symbolism, the author leverages these shades to undersign themes of conformity and banality. This technique particularly illuminates the characterization of certain figures, notably the female lead, who repeatedly appears surrounded by pale imagery - her vehicle, attire, and accessories all reinforcing her role as an idealized, yet ultimately conventional, object of desire.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local farms yield an impressive variety of produce, ranging from vine-ripened tomatoes and succulent citrus to fresh leafy vegetables and aromatic herbs. The region's agricultural bounty extends to stone fruits, various berry varieties, artisanal honey, and diverse pepper cultivars. Local residents demonstrate significant enthusiasm for community-supported agriculture (CSA), particularly organic options, with numerous programs maintaining extensive waitlists. The demand for naturally produced dairy and eggs remains consistently robust.\n\nMany agricultural enterprises in the region have diversified their revenue streams by offering educational tours and recreational activities, including nature walks and wildlife observation. This multifaceted approach enables property owners to leverage governmental assistance while enhancing natural habitats and creating additional income opportunities through various educational initiatives.\n\nWhile organic cultivation methods promote enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem health through chemical-free practices, they present unique challenges. These operations typically demand heightened labor involvement, meticulous pest management, and often experience greater crop losses compared to conventional farming methods. Smaller organic operations also face efficiency disadvantages relative to large-scale industrial farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as implementing cover crops, managing grazing patterns, controlling invasive species, and maintaining specific habitat conditions, introduce further operational complexities and expenses.\n\nThe subject property comprises 160 acres situated near Potrero, within unincorporated San Diego County, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. The landscape features a mixture of chaparral, non-indigenous Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodland communities. This location falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecological zone, as designated by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The area serves as habitat for numerous protected species, including the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat and California gnatcatcher, among others facing population decline.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples inhabited this region for generations before ranchers and wood merchants established themselves in the nineteenth century. The property's origins trace back to an original homestead grant, suggesting historical usage for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis examined current market listings and available governmental support programs to evaluate viable options for small-scale agricultural operations emphasizing wildlife conservation, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "Siblings share a unique connection - particularly brothers - that transcends ordinary relationships. This connection encompasses various sentiments: affection, honor, envy, and sometimes even malice. No one comprehends a brother quite like another brother, as they function almost as mirrors to one another. Critical moments reveal the true essence of their relationship, whether positive or negative, though such revelations often exact a significant toll. Managing the aftermath of brotherly emotions requires careful navigation. When brothers lock eyes, they perceive their authentic selves rather than the facade presented to others. Their genuine nature manifests in their choices and the subsequent results.\n\nThis sibling dynamic takes center stage in \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" where readers witness two brothers' journey through richly depicted surroundings. Their story culminates in a powerful scene where fierce pride collides with crushing failure, leaving only one survivor. The narrative employs explicit character development of Doodle and illustrates the siblings' relationship through their interactions. The narrator's perspective illuminates the intricate emotional landscape and worldview that shape the story's events.\n\nThe older brother's motivations stem primarily from ego. His initial encounters with Doodle reveal an underlying frustration - he yearned for a companion capable of matching his physical prowess, someone to \"race to Horsehead Landing\" or \"climb the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" These aspirations proved unrealistic given Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which threatened his very survival and precluded strenuous activities. The protagonist's childhood dreams shattered upon facing this reality. His reaction manifested darkly, even contemplating smothering his infant brother - an unusually sinister thought for a child. Yet Doodle's innocent smile pierced this darkness, suggesting that beneath the resentment lay an inherent fraternal bond. This transformation hints at the superficial nature of his initial hostility.",
            "Our cognitive processor - the brain - functions as an intricate system for managing and interpreting data. Throughout history, people have drawn various parallels to understand its operation, from ancient analogies of wax tablets to modern-day computational devices. Yet we must exercise caution with such comparisons, as they often oversimplify this remarkable organ's true complexity.\n\nThe process of neural interpretation begins when our sensory receptors convert external stimuli - whether tactile, thermal, auditory, or visual - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through dual processing pathways. Consider observing a white canvas containing a dark square: the primary pathway assembles basic elements like hue, alignment, and edge detection to construct the image, while the secondary pathway expedites recognition by utilizing preliminary conclusions from the first process. This dual approach helps distinguish whether we're seeing a dark object against light or a light-colored surface with a square opening.\n\nNeural mechanisms continuously filter incoming data streams, determining their significance and appropriate cognitive destination. While your neural network processes countless environmental details - like individual grass blades beneath your feet - selective attention mechanisms prevent cognitive overload. Yet these same mechanisms ensure critical stimuli, like hearing your name in a crowded space, break through the filter. This selective processing occurs continuously across multiple cognitive levels.\n\nData retention involves various memory systems - immediate sensory recall, temporary working storage, and permanent retention. The encoding process varies by input type. For instance, verbal information storage can occur through visual pattern recognition, sound-based association, or meaning-based interpretation. Retention mechanisms differ by memory type: temporary recall may involve neural circuit loops sustaining information for approximately twenty seconds, while permanent storage likely depends on protein structure modifications.\n\nScientists have proposed various frameworks explaining knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent theory suggests information exists as interconnected concept nodes, forming association networks. In this framework, related concepts - such as \"desk,\" \"wood,\" and \"furniture\" - form linked neural pathways.",
            "The economic collapse of 2007 marked a devastating period in American history. As businesses shuttered, home values plummeted, and major institutions crumbled, the nation faced its most severe financial downturn since the Great Depression. This catastrophe, which continues to influence our economy, emerged from a perfect storm of misguided policies and complex financial instruments.\n\nAt its core, the crisis stemmed from aggressive lending practices encouraged by well-intentioned but shortsighted political initiatives. Financial institutions, responding to various pressures, began offering risky loans to borrowers who traditionally wouldn't qualify. These loans were then transformed into sophisticated financial products, creating a web of interconnected risks throughout the banking system. When homeowners began defaulting, this house of cards collapsed, sending shockwaves through the global economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were planted during the late 1990s. In an effort to promote homeownership among middle and lower-income Americans, policymakers implemented measures that fundamentally altered lending practices. A prescient 1999 New York Times article by Steven Holmes warned about potential consequences, noting that Fannie Mae faced mounting pressure to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes cautioned that such practices could necessitate government intervention during an economic downturn.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated by financial innovation. Novel mortgage products and complex derivatives proliferated throughout the market. These instruments, including adjustable-rate mortgages and various securitized products, created unprecedented interconnections within the financial system. This heightened complexity left the economy particularly vulnerable to housing market fluctuations.\n\nWhen the bubble finally burst, the carnage was widespread. Major investment banks reported staggering losses, with the top five institutions holding mortgage-related debt equivalent to nearly one-third of America's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of legendary Wall Street firms, while government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, holding $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, required federal takeover by late 2008.",
            "Let's discuss the pitfalls of exposition in storytelling. While it might seem tempting to unleash a torrent of background information, this approach often proves counterproductive. Many writers, myself included, have experienced the frustration of encountering walls of explanatory text that bring narratives to a grinding halt.\n\nConsider exposition as a necessary evil rather than a storytelling tool. Though we're all familiar with the golden rule of \"show, don't tell,\" even experienced authors sometimes succumb to the temptation of information dumping. It's like having two conflicting voices in your head - one pushing you to establish context quickly, the other urging you to detail every minor character's life story.\n\nAt its core, exposition simply conveys information to readers. In movies, you'll recognize it when characters engage in unrealistic conversations purely to inform the audience. Literature employs similar techniques through narrative description.\n\nTo illustrate: imagine reading about a protagonist's whirlwind romance, marriage, and subsequent tragic loss of their spouse - all condensed into two pages with minimal dialogue. This approach robs readers of emotional investment. Instead, effective storytelling would develop the husband's character through meaningful interactions, demonstrate the relationship's impact through specific moments, and allow readers to form genuine connections with both characters. This investment makes the tragedy resonant rather than merely informative.\n\nThe challenge lies in avoiding the temptation to rush through character backgrounds. When introducing someone new - perhaps a former Air Force veteran now managing a gas station, twice divorced, with weekend fishing habits and entrepreneurial dreams - resist the urge to present these details as a simple checklist.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news coverage on August 13, 2011, I observed several notable stories on NBC 4's morning broadcast. The primary coverage centered on a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities arrested Shad Hostettler following an alleged knife attack on his spouse. The brevity of this segment seemed appropriate given the developing nature of the story.\n\nSubsequently, they reported on an incident involving an 18-year-old victim, Travis Buyers, who sustained critical injuries in a shooting at Sharon Woods. Law enforcement, including SWAT personnel, were investigating with no immediate suspects. The limited coverage of this incident appeared to reflect certain media biases in crime reporting, particularly regarding demographic representation in news coverage.\n\nThe broadcast continued with details about an investigation into damage sustained by a Med-Flight helicopter, specifically a perforation from what analysts determined to be a .22 caliber rifle round. Crime-Stoppers announced a substantial $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nA meteorological update followed, projecting afternoon precipitation and temperatures maintaining around 80-85 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend. This segment's concise nature appeared designed to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe coverage included a report about a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, where the description of the suspect received notably detailed attention regarding physical characteristics. The final segment discussed the sentencing of a Texas-based narcotics distributor, Rene Rodriguez, who received a 300-month sentence for marijuana trafficking operations between Texas and Ohio. The peculiar choice of expressing the sentence in months rather than years was particularly noteworthy.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, certain patterns emerged regarding the emphasis placed on demographic information in criminal reporting, raising questions about editorial decisions in news presentation.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent a modern financial instrument that combines the tracking capabilities of index funds with stock-like trading flexibility. These investment vehicles mirror various market segments while offering advantages typically associated with individual stocks, including short-selling opportunities, margin trading, and single-share purchase options. Despite providing these sophisticated features, ETFs maintain remarkably competitive expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.\n\nInvestors should note that ETF transactions incur brokerage commissions, similar to stock trades. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options across various sectors and asset classes. However, prudent investors must conduct thorough due diligence to verify marketed advantages such as diversification benefits and their actual magnitude. This analysis focuses on examining the IHF ETF alongside its primary constituents to assess whether holding the ETF delivers comparable advantages to maintaining positions in its top components, while also exploring potential alternative configurations that might yield superior risk-adjusted returns.\n\nTo maintain analytical clarity, our investigation concentrates on the ten largest holdings, which constitute approximately 63.58% of the fund's total assets. The subsequent analysis details these positions and their respective weightings.\n\nTo evaluate how effectively these ten positions represent the complete IHF ETF, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the corresponding portfolio metrics, including Beta coefficients and expected returns. Detailed calculations appear in the accompanying data set.\n\nAnalysis reveals that constructing a portfolio using only the top ten holdings generates returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points, representing a 16% performance improvement. Additionally, this concentrated portfolio demonstrates a Beta coefficient 0.12 lower than the complete fund. These preliminary findings suggest potential advantages in holding the top components directly. However, statistical significance testing becomes necessary to validate these apparent differences.\n\nTo determine statistical distinctiveness between these investment approaches, we calculated normalized standard deviations for each top holding, enabling direct comparison with the ETF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of the participation data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a concerning decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. Multiple factors potentially contributed to this downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our New England institution naturally deterred bicycle and pedestrian commuting. The academic calendar also played a significant role, as December brings final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties, followed by an extended holiday break when campus activity diminishes substantially.\n\nWhile these factors explain certain participation patterns, including January's low numbers coinciding with the spring semester startup, they fail to account for February's unexpectedly minimal submission rate. Such initiatives often experience peak enthusiasm initially, followed by diminishing engagement. To counter this effect, our team implemented a targeted \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign in March, successfully boosting participation rates. Nevertheless, maintaining consistent involvement proved challenging, particularly given the academic calendar's inherent disruptions.\n\nA fundamental obstacle to alternative transportation initiatives stems from America's car-centric culture, where personal vehicles represent autonomy and convenience. Our incentive structure included local business gift certificates, covering dining establishments, cafes, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, incorporating escalating reward tiers might have sustained higher participation levels. While initial prizes adequately motivated early involvement, introducing progressively valuable incentives - perhaps culminating in major prizes like premium bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - could have prevented the observed engagement decline. This graduated reward system might have effectively countered participation fatigue and maintained momentum throughout the project's duration.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, encompassing fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces employed clever editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns across most productions and some intriguing deviations in later works. The typical trick film from this era exhibited several distinctive characteristics: studio-based settings, theater-style presentation, stationary camera work, broader shot compositions, and single-scene structures. Interestingly, as the century turned, some bold filmmakers began experimenting with multiple-scene narratives.\n\nThese productions consistently utilized indoor studio sets, framed like traditional theater stages. Cameras remained fixed in position, never tracking the performers or props. This staging approach reflected strong influences from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic shows. The static camera setup naturally constrained performer movements to lateral directions, rarely allowing depth-wise motion. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where performers exclusively traverse the frame horizontally, entering stage right and moving across, while the camera maintains its fixed perspective.\n\nThe theatrical influence manifested in the predominant use of wide and occasional medium-range shots. Notably absent from these films were any close-up compositions. This mirrored the live theater experience, where audiences viewed entire performances within the stage's physical boundaries. Performers typically maintained their distance from the camera, operating in the middle ground of the frame.\n\nMost productions adhered to a single-scene format, resulting in brief running times rarely exceeding sixty seconds. This structure naturally limited narrative complexity, with most films showcasing straightforward magical demonstrations, transformations, or vanishing acts rather than developed storylines. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as continuous scenes often involved multiple shots cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) exemplifies this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate shots were joined to create the illusion of decapitation.",
            "Literary scholars often note the fascinating contradiction inherent in the term \"Gothic Novel.\" As explored in Ian Watt's analysis \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" this genre represents a unique fusion of antiquity and modernity. Throughout its evolution, the Gothic genre has weathered diverse critical reactions - some dismissing it as superficial while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nWhen Horace Walpole introduced \"The Castle of Otranto,\" he effectively birthed the Gothic genre by masterfully blending classical theatrical elements with contemporary narrative techniques. His innovative approach, which he simply termed \"A Gothic Story,\" established a new paradigm in literary expression. The genre draws heavily from medieval influences, incorporating elements of theater, architectural motifs, and cultural traditions from that era. Interestingly, by Walpole's time, the term \"gothic\" had accumulated various connotations, often carrying implications of primitiveness when contrasted with contemporary cultural and literary developments.\n\nThe enduring appeal of Gothic literature stems from its unique combination of theatrical grandeur and psychological intimacy - a characteristic made possible by the novel format. This duality allows the genre to maintain relevance across generations while simultaneously feeling both antiquated and fresh to modern readers.\n\nThe concept of chivalry emerges as a central theme in Gothic literature, particularly evident in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Medieval chivalric ideals undergo both preservation and transformation within the narrative. This focus on chivalry reflects contemporary anxieties about moral decay - Walpole, writing during politically turbulent times, appeared to view the medieval period as a lost golden age of virtue. This perspective manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal encompasses traditional knightly virtues while simultaneously exemplifying the Gothic tendency toward dramatic excess.\n\nNotably, Frederic's character embodies quintessential chivalric attributes: his royal status, his profound response to tragedy, and his presumed martyrdom at the hands of infidels all contribute to an idealized portrait of medieval nobility. This characterization, while deliberately exaggerated, serves to highlight the perceived moral gulf between past and present societies.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material processing to final delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first introduced by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, represents a comprehensive approach to orchestrating, implementing, and monitoring supply chain operations to meet consumer requirements effectively and swiftly. The framework consists of six fundamental components: production, supply, inventory management, facility location, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional service to their clientele.\n\nAt the heart of supply chain operations lies production, serving as its cornerstone. This initial phase establishes crucial parameters regarding timing, rationale, location, and methodology of manufacturing processes. Understanding market dynamics becomes paramount, as it provides the clearest indication of consumer preferences and demands. Through careful market analysis and consumer behavior interpretation, decision-makers can determine optimal product mix and quantities. Subsequently, they must identify appropriate manufacturing facilities that can achieve desired volume and quality benchmarks while ensuring customer satisfaction. The production phase concludes with detailed workflow scheduling and equipment maintenance planning. The significance of meticulous planning cannot be overstated; any oversight could result in substantial financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail establishments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nSupply, the second cornerstone, involves strategic facility capability assessment and partnership development. Manufacturing operations often encompass multiple specialized divisions, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division allocation for various production phases. Additionally, they might explore external partnerships to enhance operational velocity - the capacity to maintain quality and adaptability while optimizing cost structures.",
            "The literary landscape of Victorian England, while often associated with meticulous detail and upper-class narratives, produced some remarkable exceptions. Both Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge from these conventional patterns, embracing darker themes and supernatural elements that set them apart from their contemporaries. These works leverage mystery and unconventional storytelling techniques to develop complex character psychologies and emotional depths.\n\nConsider this passage from Oliver Twist:\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" \n(Dickens, 220)\n\nDream sequences emerge as a powerful narrative device in both novels, though each author employs them distinctively. In Oliver Twist, these surreal interludes illuminate the protagonist's psychological state and his subconscious understanding of his circumstances. Chapter 28's shooting scene exemplifies this technique, as Oliver experiences a dreamlike recollection of his trauma. The narrative emphasizes his powerlessness through vivid hallucinations featuring Sikes and Crackit. His sensory perception becomes distorted; the \"unseen hand\" that guides him goes unnoticed, while persistent pain merges with an overwhelming sense of fear. This disorientation raises questions about agency and fate in Oliver's journey. The scene suggests his gradual submission to circumstances, possibly indicating Fagin's successful manipulation of his spirit. The absence of self-preservation instincts in such a dire situation implies a deeper psychological surrender.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.",
            "During my time as a tutor in an elementary after-school program, I encountered a situation that opened my eyes to the complexities of language learning. While assisting students across various subjects, with particular expertise in literacy and English, I was specifically assigned to work with a third-grade student named Adrian who exhibited unusual reading patterns.\n\nInitially, his struggles seemed puzzling - he demonstrated inconsistent letter recognition despite being completely fluent in spoken English. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother during a day when most students were away on a field trip. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root of Adrian's challenges: while he was verbally proficient in English, his foundational understanding of the English alphabet was lacking.\n\nThis experience illuminates a broader educational challenge, particularly prevalent in California's school system, where language barriers manifest in unexpected ways. Even students who appear fully assimilated may struggle with fundamental literacy skills. The solution to such challenges requires a multifaceted approach, incorporating various educational strategies rather than relying on a single method.\n\nResearch demonstrates that dual-language education programs yield superior academic outcomes for all participants, not just English language learners. While implementing comprehensive bilingual education may seem daunting, practical solutions exist. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual, schools can employ specialized bilingual support staff to facilitate learning. This approach ensures that both native English speakers and English language learners receive the benefits of dual-language instruction while maintaining realistic staffing requirements.",
            "Humans have long grappled with the concept of a higher power - an entity that transcends our mortal understanding. While some families guide their children through structured religious education in churches or synagogues, others encourage introspective spiritual exploration. The beliefs we inherit from our families often become our initial framework, though many individuals eventually forge their own spiritual paths. Some embrace faith wholeheartedly, while others reject supernatural notions entirely, grounding themselves solely in tangible reality. This spiritual journey, unique to each person, represents our quest to illuminate life's deeper meanings.\n\nI remember that rainy afternoon clearly. Sitting beside my father on our covered porch, cigarette smoke mingling with the humid air, I asked about his preferred bird species. \"A cardinal,\" he replied softly, his gaze fixed on the downpour that overwhelmed our garden's vegetation. His appearance had changed dramatically - clothes hanging loose on his diminished frame, his once-full hair noticeably thinned. Words about his condition remained unspoken between us, too painful to acknowledge. Instead, I silently moved my chair closer, sharing in his contemplation of the summer storm.\n\nThat winter, shortly after I turned twenty-two, he succumbed to his illness. The aggressive treatments had prolonged his life beyond medical expectations, though they merely extended his suffering. My faith wavered during those dark nights, questioning the existence of a benevolent deity who would permit such prolonged anguish. Prayer felt futile, like shouting into an endless void.\n\nMaking a conscious choice, I stayed away during his final moments. The thought of witnessing his last breath seemed unbearable - I preferred preserving memories of his vitality rather than documenting his decline. Understanding him as intimately as I did, I knew he wouldn't want me present for that moment. Instead, I retreated to my bedroom, waiting in isolation for news that never came through a phone call.",
            "Among the earliest champions of Republican ideology stood John Taylor of Caroline, whose agricultural background and limited political experience shaped his passionate advocacy for individual liberties and governmental reform. His agricultural roots profoundly influenced his philosophical framework, particularly regarding governmental structures, constitutional interpretation, and judicial matters.\n\nThe American experiment fascinated Taylor, who recognized its unique position to establish an unprecedented governmental system. Without the constraints of established traditions, he believed America could pioneer genuine self-governance. Taylor emphasized the interconnected nature of fundamental human rights, arguing that these liberties formed an inseparable whole - compromise one, and the entire structure would eventually collapse. Society, he maintained, must transcend the primitive \"natural state\" where physical strength and cunning determined success.\n\nTaylor's vision for an optimal society centered on addressing humanity's dual nature. His framework acknowledged both virtuous and corrupt human tendencies, asserting that \"governmental characteristics mirror human ones.\" He championed principles supporting agricultural development and private property while opposing capitalistic excess. Taylor theorized that properly structured institutions could function effectively despite leadership's inherent self-interest. While he viewed self-interest as a universal motivator, he distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nAs a Constitutional purist, Taylor advocated for precise adherence to the founding document, seeking to restrict federal authority to explicitly granted powers. His concerns about governmental overreach stemmed from fears of costly, potentially tyrannical administration. However, he cautioned against overly literal interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the founders' intent. Notably, Taylor elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more accurate reflection of state sovereignty within the American system.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, taking in the scene below without emotion. With clinical detachment, I observed what lay before me, my thoughts flowing like water - present yet impossible to grasp. The experience felt almost meditative, my consciousness floating above any concrete analysis.\n\nI recalled enrolling in an art course years ago, where the instructor recommended Betty Edwards' Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Since childhood, I'd harbored dreams of becoming an artist, and this text promised to unlock those abilities. One particularly useful technique involved using a viewfinder - a simple frame that transformed complex scenes into manageable compositions, like reducing a cluttered kitchen view to just a single bowl of fruit.\n\nBut in this moment, no such framing device could help. The sight commanded my full attention, leaving me transfixed. Great artists are known for their signature periods - Picasso's blues, Monet's gardens, the vibrant palettes of Renaissance Italy. If I were to classify this scene before me, it would surely be my \"Brown Period,\" though not for reasons anyone would celebrate.\n\nWith deliberate movement, I reached for my tool, muscles engaging as I initiated what could have been a masterful stroke. The water moved in elegant spirals, pristine and clear. Particles separated and disappeared into the current. Growing impatient, I jammed the handle down again, but the stubborn brown mass remained steadfast, clinging to the porcelain like a defiant mollusk.\n\nThere I stood in my Rite Aid uniform, green tie choking my neck, mop nearby, contemplating this unwelcome gift left by some inconsiderate patron. After several more unsuccessful attempts, I resigned myself to the inevitable. Methodically wrapping my hand in layers of toilet paper until it resembled protective gear, I steeled myself for the unpleasant task ahead, bending forward like someone reaching into an oven, though what awaited was far from a holiday feast.",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among adolescent drivers demands our immediate attention. Research conducted by various institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, reveals a concerning correlation between neurological development and driving capabilities. The underdeveloped adolescent brain, coupled with limited driving experience, contributes significantly to increased incidents of fatal collisions, vehicle overturning, excessive speed violations, and road departures.\n\nStudies from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlight a disturbing pattern linking passenger age demographics to collision frequency. This data becomes particularly relevant when considering the social dynamics of teenage transportation habits.\n\nWhile certain jurisdictions have implemented restricted licensing programs limiting driving hours and passenger capacity, these measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem persists: empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that younger drivers lack the cognitive maturity necessary for safe vehicle operation.\n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman's research, featured in USA Today, suggests that risk-seeking behavior peaks during late adolescence, specifically before age 20. This scientific insight supports postponing full driving privileges until this developmental phase concludes. The urgency of addressing this matter intensifies when considering demographic projections: the children of Baby Boomers will soon reach driving age, potentially introducing millions of inexperienced operators to our roadways.\n\nA comprehensive solution requires standardized national regulations. Educational institutions could maintain their driver education programs, but actual licensing would be restricted to individuals 18 and older. The existing framework of provisional permits and supervised practice hours could remain intact, utilizing current state requirements as a baseline (e.g., California's model of 6 hours of professional instruction plus 50 hours of supervised practice).\n\nGiven that mortality statistics reflect a nationwide pattern, federal oversight would provide consistent protection across all jurisdictions. This proposal builds upon existing regulatory frameworks rather than introducing revolutionary concepts.",
            "An Investigation into Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) represents a fascinating intersection between neurology and auditory function. Unlike traditional hearing impairments, individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing capabilities but struggle with their brain's interpretation of auditory signals. The disorder affects how the central nervous system processes acoustic information, creating challenges in distinguishing sounds and interpreting speech patterns.\n\nHistorical developments in understanding CAPD began during the 1950s, when scientists initially termed it \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking research emerged from Italy, where Bocca and colleagues pioneered diagnostic techniques. The field advanced significantly following Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961, leading to enhanced understanding of the central auditory nervous system's role in sound perception.\n\nThe symptoms of CAPD present themselves in various ways. Affected individuals might struggle with spatial sound recognition, experience difficulty differentiating between concurrent sounds, or face challenges in identifying vocal nuances like sarcasm. Some patients report problems with sequential sound processing or demonstrate an inability to effectively synthesize acoustic information for practical use.\n\nDiagnostic procedures for CAPD involve comprehensive evaluations conducted by healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists. These assessments typically encompass behavioral observations, questionnaire responses, and specialized auditory tests. While no singular diagnostic tool exists as the definitive standard, practitioners often employ multiple simultaneous sound stimuli tests and advanced acoustic response measurements to evaluate patient conditions.\n\nThe absence of a unified diagnostic approach and clear etiology makes CAPD a particularly complex disorder to identify and treat. However, ongoing research continues to enhance our understanding of this condition and improve therapeutic strategies.",
            "My aspiration to enter the field of social work stems from a deep-seated desire to advocate for children facing abuse and neglect through the Division of Family and Children Services. The cornerstone principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, maintaining ethical standards, fostering interpersonal relationships, and continuous professional development. These principles resonate deeply with both my professional ambitions and personal convictions.\n\nThe path to discovering my vocation wasn't straightforward. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with various challenges, often resorting to questionable coping mechanisms. This observation led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. A pivotal moment occurred that summer when I encountered a distressed teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home environment at a friend's house. The subsequent interaction with law enforcement and the young man's parents, who dismissed serious allegations as \"simple disputes,\" crystallized my calling toward social work.\n\nMy commitment to social advocacy extends beyond professional aspirations. I've long questioned society's paradoxical relationship with individuality - how we simultaneously celebrate uniqueness while enforcing conformity. Throughout my academic journey, I actively challenged societal norms through various forms of self-expression and involvement in social justice initiatives. My participation in GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and consistent opposition to discrimination and racism reflect my unwavering dedication to promoting social equity. This commitment to challenging systemic injustices remains integral to my professional mission in social work.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through both biological and sociocultural frameworks. While the biological perspective emphasizes hereditary factors and physiological mechanisms, sociocultural analysis considers environmental influences, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic variables. This examination explores these perspectives through current research, evaluating both the merits and limitations of various studies.\n\nSleep disorders fall into distinct categories: primary disorders, those connected to existing mental health conditions, and those stemming from other causes. Primary disorders encompass two main groups: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. The former includes conditions like Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and several others, while Parasomnias manifest as behavioral or physiological abnormalities during sleep, such as night terrors or sleepwalking.\n\nRecent neurological research has revealed fascinating insights into sleep regulation. Scientists have identified specific neurons in the hypothalamus that contain orexin, which plays a crucial role in sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with rodents have demonstrated that GABAB receptors on these neurons significantly influence sleep patterns. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, they observed increased sleep promotion. Moreover, the administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, resulted in extended sleep duration. These findings suggest potential implications for human sleep disorders, particularly regarding genetic predisposition and environmental factors affecting sleep regulation. Such biological factors can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning, from academic performance to professional capabilities.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating our expansive campus. When I resided in East Halls during my initial year, specifically Stuart Hall, the daily trek to central campus locations like Willard Building would consume nearly half an hour, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast empty spaces - areas now occupied by athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery, and residential complexes. This continuous expansion has exacerbated transportation challenges across campus.\n\nThe optimal solution to this mobility dilemma lies in promoting bicycle usage. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague who rediscovered cycling shared an interesting perspective: \"After dismissing bikes as unfashionable for several years, I've realized they're actually indispensable for campus navigation.\" Beyond the obvious health advantages, bicycles represent the most energy-efficient transportation method - a simple breakfast can fuel extensive travel distances.\n\nCurrently residing off-campus at a distance comparable to some university housing, I consider my bicycle purchase this semester's wisest investment. My daily commute to Thomas Building, typically a 25-minute walk, reduces to merely 5 minutes by bicycle. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my demanding schedule necessitates faster transportation. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 2.5 hours weekly just for Thomas Building commutes, not including other campus destinations - proves invaluable given my packed academic calendar.",
            "In his masterwork Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a dystopian society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes individuality, and instant gratification becomes the primary driving force of human existence. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere pieces in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA close reading through Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about societal development and economic systems. The text employs numerous concepts parallel to Marxist thought, including social uniformity and the transformation of human experience into commodity, suggesting Huxley's commentary on contemporary economic transformations.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of social conditioning mirrors the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. In this society, the lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - are programmed through sleep-learning to embrace consumerist behaviors and hedonistic pursuits. This manipulation, orchestrated by the ruling authority, demonstrates the concept of hegemonic control, where dominant groups maintain power through cultural influence rather than force. The higher castes, despite their enhanced cognitive capabilities, largely accept this system without question, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the novel's depiction of human connections, or rather, their absence. Characters lack psychological complexity, suggesting the dehumanizing effects of technological consumerism. Emotional depth is replaced by superficial interactions - men evaluate women purely on physical attributes, while women discuss intimate encounters with clinical detachment. The rigid social hierarchy, accepted unquestioningly by each caste, reflects Marxist observations about class consciousness, where groups are pacified through illusions of superiority and the constant cycle of consumption and compliance.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a religious studies course focusing on Islamic traditions. The discourse frequently centered on public perceptions of Islam's fundamental nature. This topic remains extraordinarily pertinent in contemporary society. The evolution of media coverage post-September 11th has been fascinating to observe, shifting from initial antagonism toward Islamic communities to what some might consider excessive accommodation. The political landscape has similarly transformed; consider the unprecedented success of candidates with Muslim heritage in American politics.\n\nThe historical accounts of Muhammad's life present some intriguing contradictions. Traditional historical sources often portray military conquests and forceful expansion, yet the biographical texts paint a markedly different picture. These narratives describe a misunderstood spiritual leader who attracted followers through humility and wisdom rather than coercion.\n\nWhat stands out in these biographical accounts are the parallels with other religious traditions, particularly regarding miraculous events. For instance, descriptions of food multiplication ceremonies bear striking resemblance to earlier religious narratives. This pattern of similar miraculous accounts across religious texts raises questions about historical authenticity and the potential appropriation of established religious motifs.\n\nThe biographical sources frequently employ a particular narrative structure, emphasizing voluntary conversions and spontaneous recognition of divine truth. However, the reliability of these accounts becomes questionable when examining their transmission chains. The multiple layers of narration - \"according to person A, who heard from person B\" - while intended to establish credibility, actually diminish the historical reliability of these accounts.\n\nPerhaps most striking is the disparity between the biographical portrayal of Muhammad as an exceptionally humble and peaceful leader versus historical evidence suggesting a more complex figure who effectively utilized military and political power. This raises important questions about historical accuracy and the potential gap between scholarly understanding and popular beliefs within contemporary Islamic communities.",
            "Following Christ's death, the core principles he advocated during his mortal existence were swiftly abandoned as Christian philosophy evolved. Examining the historical trajectory reveals Christianity's gradual deviation from its foundational roots. Contemporary society exhibits increasing enlightenment and unprecedented liberal tendencies. Although conservative elements persist, steadfastly adhering to inherited doctrines, their influence may prove insufficient to shape collective consciousness. The Christian community will likely experience a surge in historical consciousness in coming generations. A collective desire will emerge to separate accumulated theological additions from the authentic intentions of Christianity's founder. Though this transformation may span generations or centuries, its culmination appears inevitable: Christian history will witness a dramatic reversal. A retrograde progression toward its original form will unfold. A groundswell movement will systematically strip away doctrinal layers, effectively rewinding time until solely Jesus' divine message remains, unencumbered by subsequent theological interpretations. As this phenomenon sweeps across Western civilization, inspiring multitudes to embrace Christ's original teachings, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their leadership role. Yet, as theological retrograde occurs, Christianity's current denominational diversity will consolidate toward unified beliefs and practices. Inter-regional, inter-denominational, and other sectarian distinctions will diminish in favor of increasing homogeneity. History demonstrates such reversals: Rome transformed from Christianity's persecutor to its champion; America evolved from enslaving African-Americans to embracing their leadership. Christianity's impending transformation will manifest through theological simplification, seeking original truth while reducing diversity. This evolution requires interpreting Jesus' teachings metaphorically rather than literally. To understand this trajectory, we must examine Christianity's origins. Prior to 63 BCE, when Rome seized Jerusalem, Judaism provided Christianity's theological foundation. Jewish society, embracing monotheism, divine revelation, and Hebrew scripture, was nevertheless fragmented into distinct groups: Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through careful analysis of Upton Sinclair's masterwork \"The Jungle,\" one can observe a compelling portrayal of humanity's inherent tendency toward avarice and self-preservation. The narrative expertly demonstrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of authority, prioritize personal advancement while disregarding the welfare of their subordinates.\n\nThis phenomenon manifests most prominently in the industrial magnates who controlled the massive manufacturing enterprises. Their singular focus on expansion and profit maximization led to a callous disregard for collateral damage, whether environmental or human. As Sinclair eloquently illustrates, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This vivid imagery underscores the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization, with factory emissions and livestock waste contaminating the surrounding ecosystem with impunity.\n\nThe exploitation extended beyond environmental concerns to encompass labor practices. As one passage notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" In an era devoid of worker protections, management exercised unprecedented control over their workforce, subjecting them to hazardous conditions and arbitrary termination without recourse.\n\nThe absence of regulatory oversight or social support systems left workers particularly vulnerable. While labor unions emerged as a potential solution, they often proved predatory rather than protective. The deplorable conditions faced by workers drew parallels to institutional slavery, as evidenced by Sinclair's observation that \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Among Edgar Allan Poe's poetic works, \"Dream-land\" stands as a notable composition that reveals fascinating literary connections. The recurring mention of \"Thulé\" within this piece has sparked scholarly interest regarding its origins. While traditional analysis points to Virgilian influence, where the term designated a mysterious northern isle beyond Britain's shores, contemporary research suggests alternative inspirations.\n\nThe German literary tradition, particularly through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, emerges as a compelling source. Literary scholar Karl J. Arndt's comparative analysis in his scholarly work about Poe and Goethe's writings identifies striking parallels between their respective compositions.\n\nGoethe, renowned for his masterwork Faust (published in two installments: 1808 and 1832), incorporated \"The King of Thulé\" within its pages. This embedded narrative presents a poignant tale of loss and mortality: a bereaved monarch, clutching a gifted goblet from his deceased queen, surrenders to grief-induced drinking before choosing a dramatic end. The thematic resonance between this account and \"Dream-Land\" suggests more than coincidental similarity, perhaps reflecting shared meditations on mortality and loss.\n\nThe temporal proximity between Grattan's 1842 dramatic adaptation of Faust and Poe's subsequent usage of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" further strengthens these connections. Moreover, Poe's documented appreciation of Tennyson, who himself acknowledged Goethe's influence, establishes additional literary linkages.\n\n\"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share remarkable atmospheric elements: both evoke desolate landscapes, spectral presences, and profound solitude. This spiritual kinship between the works suggests Poe's creative engagement with Goethe's literary legacy, enhanced by the numerous contemporary adaptations circulating in literary circles of the period.",
            "An analysis of potential punitive damages in a California premises liability case:\n\nWhen examining whether punitive damages could be awarded in a slip-and-fall incident at a retail establishment, several key factors must be considered. The incident in question occurred at D&D Markets, where customer Jennifer Palmer sustained significant back injuries after encountering an unremediated applesauce spill.\n\nThe circumstances leading to the incident are particularly noteworthy. Two separate employees alerted the store manager, Paul Martin, about the hazard at 5:00 PM and 5:15 PM respectively. Martin, who was taking his dinner break, dismissed both notifications, stating he \"didn't have time to deal with customer complaints.\" The accident occurred at 5:30 PM, following thirty minutes of managerial inaction.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 3294(a) establishes that punitive damages may be recovered in non-contractual obligations where the defendant exhibited \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute further defines malicious conduct as either intentionally harmful or \"despicable\" with \"willful and conscious disregard\" for others' safety.\n\nLegal precedent, particularly Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1979), suggests that malicious conduct encompasses situations where defendants recognize probable dangers yet deliberately fail to address them. This interpretation becomes especially relevant given D&D Markets' history of five previous slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 alone.\n\nGiven these circumstances, a court would likely allow the punitive damages claim to proceed. While proving despicable conduct may present challenges, the manager's deliberate inaction despite awareness of both the immediate hazard and the store's history of similar incidents provides substantial grounds for arguing conscious disregard for customer safety.",
            "The emptiness persisted within her consciousness, an enigmatic void that demanded satiation. This peculiar sensation first manifested during her early adolescence, around age fourteen, and maintained its grip well into her seventeenth year. Eventually, she recognized that her yearning centered not on material possessions but on human connection. Curiously, despite numerous admirers and awkward courtship attempts from her male peers, none sparked her interest. This puzzling circumstance prompted frequent self-reflection, though years of introspection yielded no satisfactory explanations for her apparent immunity to teenage romance.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere typically exuded tranquility, courtesy of her remarkably harmonious parents. Conflicts rarely erupted within their household, save for occasional tensions regarding her burgeoning independence. While her parents embodied serenity, she possessed an effervescent spirit that, coupled with her genuine kindness, drew others to her naturally.\n\nThe day's peaceful facade shattered when an agonized cry echoed from the kitchen. Rushing toward the source, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, writhing in evident distress. \"Mom?!\" she called out, heart racing. Between labored breaths, her mother requested immediate medical attention. Drawing upon strength acquired through dedicated training, she carefully lifted her incapacitated parent and transported her to their vehicle.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic environment barely registered as she focused solely on securing assistance. Medical personnel quickly converged, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination. Left alone in the waiting area, she contemplated the simple accident that precipitated this crisis - her mother's unfortunate tumble from a stepstool while reaching for an elevated vase.",
            "Recent research has explored the connection between cardiovascular health outcomes and dietary patterns characteristic of Mediterranean regions. The investigation centered on evaluating whether individuals following traditional Mediterranean eating habits - assessed through an adapted scoring system called the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) score - experienced fewer instances of heart disease, stroke, and related mortality.\n\nThe Mediterranean dietary pattern emphasizes abundant plant-based foods, including various fruits, legumes, whole grain products, and tree nuts (though notably excluding potatoes). It also favors fish consumption and olive oil over saturated fats, while limiting animal products. Wine consumption in moderation is considered acceptable within this framework.\n\nEarlier research had already established promising correlations between Mediterranean-style eating and reduced overall mortality, particularly from cardiovascular causes. One notable intervention demonstrated superior outcomes in obese participants following Mediterranean guidelines compared to those on low-fat regimens, specifically regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles. However, stroke-specific outcomes remained largely unexplored.\n\nThe researchers tracked 74,886 female nurses aged 38-63 across 11 American states, all initially free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Throughout two decades (1984-2004), dietary habits were monitored via detailed questionnaires administered six times. These food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) underwent rigorous validation, with participant retention exceeding 95%. Health outcomes were meticulously documented through medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, with some cases classified as \"probable\" when complete documentation was unavailable.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, the analysis incorporated various lifestyle factors including exercise patterns, body mass metrics, smoking habits, medication use, and hormonal status. The researchers employed cumulative averaging of dietary scores and adjusted for potential confounding variables using sophisticated statistical methods, specifically Cox proportional-hazard modeling.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective effects: women maintaining stricter adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns showed approximately 29% lower risk of both coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those least aligned with these eating habits. The study documented 2,391 heart disease cases, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths over the 20-year period.",
            "A striking image emerges: Academy Award nominee Ellen Page stands sentinel on a street corner, brandishing a cardboard placard with an enigmatic message about Hitler's supposed presence in Burma. This Southeast Asian nation, formally Myanmar, has languished under military control since a forceful governmental overthrow in 1962. The country's recent history includes significant civil unrest, particularly during 2007, when Buddhist monastics initiated the first major public demonstrations in ten years.\n\nThese peaceful protests, dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution\" after the monks' traditional garments, gradually attracted widespread civilian participation. Although initially tolerant, the ruling junta's response grew increasingly hostile, culminating in systematic monastery raids and violent confrontations. International media faced severe restrictions, with journalists facing immediate detention. One particularly tragic incident involved Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai, who lost his life while documenting a demonstration on September 27th, 2007. While official statistics cite only 13 casualties, military defector Colonel Hla Win suggested the actual death toll reached thousands.\n\nSuch authoritarian suppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine authority to justify absolute power. Similarly, Japanese imperial tradition maintains their rulers' divine lineage. Modern parallels exist in contemporary political structures, including certain American administrative practices involving religious consultation.\n\nHistorical precedents include China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, where peaceful demonstrators faced military intervention. Casualty estimates vary dramatically - government figures suggest 200-300 deaths, while Chinese Red Cross data indicates 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The 1990s Rwandan crisis saw government-backed Hutu militias targeting Tutsi civilians and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution of Jewish populations across Europe serves as another devastating example of state-sponsored violence.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his extensive career and remarkable ability to mold his ensemble's sound. While his piano work remains understated in many compositions, his genius shines through his intricate arrangements that brilliantly highlighted each musician's strengths. He developed musical structures that balanced improvisation with carefully orchestrated segments, allowing soloists to express themselves while maintaining cohesive arrangements that capitalized on individual performers' unique styles.\n\nThe celebrated musician's command of orchestration manifested in his ability to blend diverse instrumental voices into groundbreaking compositions. His profound understanding of each performer's distinctive sound, combined with his talent for ensemble arrangement, resulted in revolutionary jazz compositions that continue to inspire.\n\nMusic scholars frequently reference works like Creole Love Call when discussing innovative vocal techniques in jazz. This composition exemplifies his pioneering approach to using vocals as an instrumental element, free from lyrical constraints. The piece unfolds across six distinct blues choruses:\n\n- First: Interplay between vocals and woodwinds, evolving from smooth to textured\n- Second: A muted trumpet explores melodic variations with blue note emphasis\n- Third: High-register clarinet solo with subtle piano accompaniment\n- Fourth: Full ensemble recreation of opening dialogue between brass and reeds\n- Fifth: Peak intensity with high reed section leads, supported by brass and rhythm\n- Sixth: Return to vocal-reed dialogue featuring instrumental-style vocal techniques\n- Conclusion: Vocal flourish with unconventional trombone ending\n\nThis innovative approach to vocal integration became a hallmark of Ellington's style. Later works like Hot and Bothered further demonstrated his orchestration mastery, featuring remarkable interplay between Miley's muted trumpet and Cox's scatting. Similarly, It Don't Mean a Thing showcases Nanton's distinctive trombone introduction, exemplifying Ellington's talent for featuring his musicians' unique capabilities.",
            "What drives the evolutionary pathways of living creatures? Can we identify specific factors that channel the direction of evolutionary development? Back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson noted the scientific community's inability to express biological forms through mathematical means - an observation that remains surprisingly relevant today. Recent scientific endeavors have begun incorporating mathematical frameworks to analyze mollusk shell development, both in individual growth and across species evolution (see work by Raup and Stanley, 1981).\n\nOur research investigates Prunum specimens using mathematical models to understand developmental patterns and evolutionary shifts. By analyzing X-ray images, we extracted numerical data to construct both theoretical and actual shell structures using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). This approach allowed us to explore the theoretical limits of morphological variation within Prunum. We're currently integrating these findings with empirical observations to better comprehend large-scale evolutionary transitions in this group.\n\nConsider a mollusk shell's fundamental structure: it's essentially a tube that spirals through space, completing 360-degree rotations. These spiral segments, called whorls, encircle an imaginary central line - the columella. The growth rate of these whorls varies, with each rotation marked by a line called the suture. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically appears largest, while preceding whorls form the spire. The shell's extremities include the apex (top) and base (bottom), with the aperture serving as the opening for the animal.\n\nShell orientation can be described from multiple angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. Standard presentation shows the shell in apertural view, with the opening facing forward and apex upward.\n\nTo measure whorls accurately, examine the shell from above, locate the initial suture, and draw a reference line across the shell. Count whorls from this line, measuring to quarter-whorl precision.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a sequence of apertures progressing through three-dimensional space as the organism builds its structure. This progression can be tracked by mapping aperture centers and dimensions throughout the shell's growth. Such data enables both visual and mathematical representation, allowing us to model variations in shell development patterns.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's infant and newborn death rates have shown minimal fluctuation. Despite progress in various Millennium Development Goals, including improvements in water access and sanitation facilities, advancements in child and maternal wellness fall significantly behind expected benchmarks for 2015. Several factors contribute to these challenges, suggesting that broad healthcare infrastructure enhancement might prove more beneficial than isolated program-specific initiatives.\n\nStatistics show that approximately 72% of Indonesian births now occur with professional medical assistance. However, this figure includes traditional birth attendants who lack the medical expertise to handle complications, particularly in cases of severe bleeding, which remains a leading cause of maternal fatalities. This statistical improvement, therefore, presents an overly optimistic picture. Furthermore, professional medical treatment for children under five suffering from diarrheal conditions has decreased. Available information about post-birth care, though limited, indicates substantial deficiencies nationwide.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% nationally. A stark urban-rural divide exists, with cities reporting 7% cesarean deliveries compared to rural areas' 2%. This disparity highlights significant healthcare accessibility issues across regions. Economic factors also play a crucial role, with a 27-percentage-point difference in healthcare utilization between the most affluent and impoverished segments of society, largely attributed to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant healthcare metrics, policymakers face a fundamental choice between targeted interventions and comprehensive healthcare system reform. While specialized programs offer appealing advantages, including clearer objectives and quicker outcomes, they present notable challenges. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health services and attract healthcare workers away from essential roles. Moreover, multiple parallel initiatives frequently result in redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, particularly in resource management and funding allocation.",
            "Over the last century, the landscape of Popular Music has expanded tremendously, encompassing an ever-growing array of musical styles. Within this vast spectrum, numerous categories have emerged - from hip-hop to blues, from contemporary country to traditional folk - each subsequently branching into countless subdivisions. Among these musical offshoots, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly noteworthy, having evolved into an intricate web of musical expressions over the past four decades.\n\nHeavy Metal's significance stems from its emotional depth and adaptability. While often gravitating toward darker themes, the genre demonstrates remarkable versatility. Shortly after its inception, musicians began exploring its boundaries, leading to an explosion of distinctive sub-styles. This continuous evolution persists today, resulting in an increasingly complex musical taxonomy.\n\nThe contemporary Heavy Metal scene has become so diverse that defining its core characteristics presents a significant challenge. While incorporating elements from various musical traditions, the genre maintains its unique identity. To grasp modern metal's complexity, one must examine it not merely as a musical category but as a cultural phenomenon that has transformed the musical landscape.\n\nMetal's essence lies in its intensity and technical prowess. It pushes boundaries through enhanced volume, aggressive bass lines, and theatrical presentations. Unlike simpler musical forms, metal demands exceptional instrumental mastery from its practitioners. The genre's development was notably influenced by the psychedelic movement of the 1970s, when artists, often under the influence of mind-altering substances, created unprecedented soundscapes. Metal broke new ground by embracing darker emotional territories, contrasting sharply with the lighter themes prevalent in mainstream music. Modern metal continues to draw inspiration from the emotional intensity characteristic of Romantic-era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles, often cited as an early metal prototype. Created as a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcases darker themes and drug-influenced narratives, marking a significant departure from their typical style. Its inclusion on the White Album demonstrated the band's ability to venture into heavier musical territory.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, preceding the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was developing his distinctive artistic vision. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, illustrates both a literal dream sequence and symbolizes his personal aspirations. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau yearned for acceptance within the artistic community, leading to an internal conflict that defined his creative process. This tension manifested most prominently in The Dream, which embodies his struggle between conforming to established artistic conventions and maintaining his unique creative expression.\n\nUnderstanding this masterwork requires context about its creator's life journey. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, Rousseau emerged from middle-class origins, with his father operating a successful hardware business. Unlike his contemporaries, he lacked formal artistic training, spending his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly - his first marriage to Clémence ended in heartbreak, with eight children lost in infancy and only his daughter Julia surviving. Art became his salvation, offering solace and new purpose. While other artists of his era often depicted idealized rural life, Rousseau's work reflected authentic working-class perspectives and aspirations.\n\nThe artist's desperate quest for recognition becomes more comprehensible considering his circumstances. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of numerous established modern artists. For instance, his career overlapped with Henri Matisse's emergence in the art scene. However, as noted by art critic Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters, these contemporaries pursued drastically different artistic objectives: Matisse actively avoided conventional expression, while Rousseau earnestly sought acceptance from traditional artistic institutions through conventional approaches.",
            "Throughout history, scholars have noted the deep relationship between moral principles and artistic expression, suggesting an inherent connection between what is virtuous and what is beautiful. This observation resonates with classical perspectives, such as the famous lines from Keats's poetry about truth and beauty being one and the same. Unlike scientific knowledge or practical skills, our understanding of both ethics and artistic merit seems to emerge naturally, without formal instruction. These fields focus on describing existing phenomena rather than establishing rigid guidelines.\n\nWhen we examine artistic or ethical evaluation, we find that conventional analysis often falls short of capturing their true essence. Consider how we discuss masterpieces like the Mona Lisa - while we can analyze its technical elements and historical significance, these aspects alone don't fully explain its enduring impact. People often struggle to articulate why they're drawn to particular artworks, frequently prefacing their explanations with statements about indefinable qualities. This suggests that both artistic and moral excellence possess characteristics that defy complete analytical breakdown.\n\nThis perspective aligns with literary theorists who argue that certain truths can only be conveyed through narrative rather than direct statement. The ineffable quality present in both artistic and ethical domains points to their transcendent nature, suggesting a fundamental connection between these two spheres of human experience. The relationship becomes particularly evident in literature, where artistic expression and moral considerations naturally intersect. Literary works engage with value systems in ways that other art forms might not, making them uniquely positioned to explore ethical dimensions. This integration of moral and aesthetic elements in literature reflects how these values function in our lived experience, where they operate on levels beyond pure rational analysis.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a formidable nation, exhibiting cultural diversity that spans from Munich's alpine foothills to the northern maritime city of Kiel. This rich tapestry of traditions extends across the nation, from Cologne's Rhine-side communities to Dresden's historic Elbe riverbanks. The complex mosaic of contemporary German identity reflects its origins from numerous historical groups and ancestral populations.\n\nThe historical territory known as Germania represents the ancient homeland of the German peoples, though the etymology of this designation remains contentious within academic circles. According to historical accounts, the term's origins may be traced to the Tungri tribe, as documented by Tacitus, who noted their earlier designation as \"Germans\" prior to their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. The term \"Germanus\" first appeared in Caesar's accounts of the Gallic Wars, borrowed from Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples. Linguistic scholars propose various etymological roots, including possible connections to ancient weaponry terminology (the \"ger\" spear) or Celtic linguistic origins suggesting \"shouting ones.\"\n\nHistorical documentation from 98 CE, specifically Tacitus's ethnographic study, presents the Germanic peoples as indigenous to their territory, suggesting minimal external genetic influence. He emphasized the region's inhospitable nature, questioning why anyone would voluntarily relocate to such challenging terrain unless it represented their ancestral homeland.\n\nRoman interaction with Germania remained primarily commercial and military in nature. While the empire conducted periodic campaigns into Germanic territories, permanent settlement proved uncommon. Germanic tribes, emerging prominently during the first century CE, established themselves along Roman imperial boundaries, engaging in trade and frequently serving as auxiliary forces within Roman military structures.",
            "Shakespeare's masterpiece \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex interplay between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The dilemma intensifies when one considers the social consequences of unveiling such deceptions - some relationships may weather the revelation, while others crumble under the weight of betrayed trust.\n\nThe narrative raises particularly intriguing questions regarding gender performance and its motivations. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine dress emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy simultaneously isolates her from female companionship and support networks.\n\nThe complications multiply exponentially when her masculine persona proves too convincing. Olivia's passionate declaration - \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138) - demonstrates the dangerous effectiveness of Viola's disguise. Meanwhile, her interactions with Orsino generate their own tensions: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nContemporary audiences might interpret these identity games as Shakespeare's commentary on repressed desires and sexual fluidity. The confusion surrounding Viola/Cesario's identity creates situations where characters must confront their own assumptions about attraction and gender. However, Olivia's character seems less an exploration of latent same-sex desire and more a satirical portrait of superficial attraction. This interpretation gains credence through her seamless transfer of affections to Sebastian and subsequent familial acceptance of Viola: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315).",
            "Historical accounts frequently highlight the harsh nature of German colonial administration, particularly regarding the atrocities against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, this perspective oversimplifies a complex imperial system that exhibited remarkable diversity across its territories. Educational initiatives, for instance, varied significantly between regions. Following Britain's acquisition of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, administrators discovered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun and other territories under German administration.\n\nNamibia (formerly South West Africa) tells a markedly different story. While East African territories benefited from government-established educational institutions, Namibian indigenous education relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal state support. Conversely, the administration channeled substantial resources into European education, establishing public schools and providing enhanced support for mission-based institutions serving the settler population. These disparate approaches created lasting educational inequalities. Unlike other former German territories, where literacy rates flourished, Namibia's indigenous population remained largely uneducated. Multiple socioeconomic and political elements contributed to this unique trajectory, which warrants further investigation, particularly considering recent scholarship examining settler-indigenous relations.\n\nThe academic literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, predominantly consisting of German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused primarily on documenting educational structures, while subsequent English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and explored specific educational aspects across different territories. Cohen's research, comparing educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, stands as a pivotal contribution, attributing many distinctive features to South West Africa's substantial settler presence.\n\nThe territory's relatively mild climate, despite its largely desert landscape, attracted significant European settlement. By 1913, South West Africa hosted approximately 15,000 European residents, nearly triple the settler population of East Africa, its closest competitor in terms of European inhabitants.",
            "For nearly six decades, spanning 1836 to 1893, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tension in their bilateral relationship. The relationship reached its most volatile point during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in Mexico's defeat and the subsequent American acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Tensions persisted through various confrontations until shortly before WWI, with fundamental differences in faith, societal norms, and material interests driving the conflict.\n\nNeighboring countries frequently experience such prolonged rivalries. Geographic proximity often catalyzes disputes over resources and territory, as demonstrated by numerous historical examples worldwide. The U.S.-Mexico dynamic mirrors many such border-state conflicts. Research indicates that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba have maintained sustained diplomatic tensions with the United States, while other regional countries have generally maintained cordial relationships.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in the discord. Much like how 20th-century America opposed totalitarian ideologies, earlier generations harbored strong anti-Catholic and anti-monarchical sentiments. This religious-ideological divide parallels other historical conflicts, such as U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War, though the latter centered on political rather than religious differences. The antagonism partly stemmed from inherited Anglo-Spanish antipathies, complicating early diplomatic efforts between the young nations.\n\nHistorical records document 17 distinct conflicts during the 57-year period of rivalry. Most incidents involved territorial disputes, particularly cross-border raids and frontier-related issues. Both nations eventually deployed military forces to address persistent banditry problems along their shared border.\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic dependence on the United States. By the late 1800s, American priorities shifted from territorial expansion to economic involvement in Mexico, fundamentally altering the relationship's dynamic.",
            "In 2008, a rare medical condition struck without warning, transforming my life overnight. At that juncture, I was practicing nursing - a career path I had selected primarily for its promise of stability, having internalized the common wisdom that healthcare would forever remain a secure employment sector. Despite harboring aspirations in scientific research and journalism, I opted for what seemed the safer route.\n\nThe reality hit hard when, at age 46, I found myself incapacitated and unable to maintain employment. My situation hasn't improved since then. A decade and a half of subsisting on disability benefits has stripped away my material possessions and financial security. Each day presents its own set of challenges, constantly testing my resilience and self-worth. While uncertainty permeates every aspect of my existence, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close companions. Such crises have a way of humbling even the most self-reliant individuals.\n\nLife's unpredictability means we're all susceptible to emergencies, regardless of our preparation level. Some obstacles simply prove too formidable to tackle independently. While I acknowledge the necessity of reducing our dependence on governmental institutions - which have proven increasingly unreliable - I advocate for strengthening community bonds rather than pursuing isolation.\n\nHistorical revisionists often romanticize American individualism, but our nation's true foundation rests on principles of collective support and resource sharing. Consider the westward expansion: success depended on cooperation, not isolation.\n\nPersonal preparedness remains crucial - I maintain emergency supplies, including medical kits, water purification systems, and non-perishable foods. Those with access to land should consider sustainable farming practices. However, equally important is fostering connections within your community. True resilience emerges from the strength of our social fabric, not just our individual preparations.",
            "The origins of Buddhism can be traced back to approximately 500 BCE, when an enlightened individual, later known as the Buddha, emerged from his privileged life as a prince. His philosophical insights eventually developed into what we now recognize as Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism representing its most traditional form. As with any ancient belief system spanning millennia, modern Buddhist practices have evolved considerably from their original form. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual performed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony that, while deeply meaningful to both religious officials and ordinary practitioners, finds no basis in the Buddha's original teachings. Such adaptations extend beyond mere customs to influence fundamental religious principles. The evolution of Theravada Buddhist doctrine, affecting both monastics and lay followers, stems from various influences, some originating within the faith community and others from outside sources, with impacts ranging from constructive to destructive.\n\nTo facilitate this analysis, several key distinctions must be established. Forces of change can be categorized as either originating from within the Buddhist community (internal) or from non-Buddhist sources (external). Additionally, these influences may be classified as either antagonistic - arising from anti-Buddhist sentiment and causing harm - or neutral, having no intentional impact on the faith community, though indirect effects may occur.\n\nUnderstanding Theravada Buddhism requires familiarity with its fundamental principles. Adherents place their faith in three core elements: the Buddha himself, the Dhamma (teachings), and the Sangha (religious community). The Dhamma encompasses three collections of sacred texts: narratives of Buddha's teachings (Sutta Pitaka), monastic regulations (Vinaya Pitaka), and philosophical discourse (Abhidhamma Pitaka). Central concepts include the absence of an eternal soul (Anatta), life's inherent challenges (Dukkha), and universal impermanence (Anicca). Comprehending these principles is essential for breaking free from the cycle of rebirth (Sansara) and overcoming desire, hatred, and confusion. While lay practitioners follow five basic moral guidelines, religious officials observe numerous additional regulations. The foundation of Buddhist philosophy rests upon three noble truths: the reality of suffering, its origin in attachment, and the possibility of its cessation."
