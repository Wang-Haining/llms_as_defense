            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation process, cultural dynamics emerge as a crucial factor. The concept of culture defies simple categorization; it's a complex tapestry that cannot be reduced to stereotypes or broad generalizations. Rather than making sweeping assumptions like \"Europeans are direct\" or \"Asians are indirect,\" successful negotiators recognize the nuanced impact of cultural influences on business discussions. When individuals encounter different cultural frameworks, they inevitably filter these experiences through their own cultural lens, creating a natural comparative analysis.\n\nSuccessfully navigating cultural differences requires deep engagement, from exploring historical contexts to understanding inherent biases. Instead of critiquing or attempting to modify cultural norms, effective negotiators adapt their approach to work within established cultural parameters. This becomes particularly critical when operating from a position of lesser leverage or when conducting negotiations in unfamiliar territory. Demonstrating cultural sensitivity and respecting local customs often serves as a bridge across cultural divides.\n\nCultural distinctions extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each business entity typically develops its distinctive organizational ethos. This manifests in various ways: work-life balance expectations, communication protocols, attire requirements, and charitable engagement policies. Even within a single nation, corporate cultures can vary dramatically between organizations, and sometimes between different locations of the same company. While some societies might present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals subtle but significant internal variations.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides insight into cultural motivations. In societies where maintaining harmony or preserving dignity is paramount, negotiators typically avoid actions that could cause public embarrassment. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures might focus more on securing optimal terms than swift resolution. While these cultural patterns provide valuable context, successful negotiators also invest time in understanding their counterparts' individual perspectives and motivations.",
            "In both Psalm 14 and the philosophical works of Anselm and Aquinas, we encounter the dismissal of atheistic thought. When comparing these two medieval theologians' perspectives on proving God's existence, we must operate within their shared theological framework - specifically, the Christian conception of deity. Any broader interpretation would muddy our analysis of their distinct approaches to divine proof. However, despite their earnest attempts, I contend that neither philosopher presents an entirely convincing case for God's existence.\n\nAnselm's methodology centers on introspective reasoning. His argument suggests that our ability to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence. By positing that we cannot truly imagine God's non-existence while holding the concept of God in our minds, Anselm develops what modern philosophers term an ontological argument. While his logic follows an intriguing path, it essentially boils down to finding divine truth through internal contemplation rather than external evidence. This approach aligns closely with the Christian notion of faith-based understanding.\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions empirical observation and logical deduction. His famous \"Five Ways\" present systematic arguments based on observable phenomena: motion, causation, necessity, gradation, and design. Each pathway constructs a logical framework necessitating God's existence, much like deducing the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece by examining the surrounding completed sections. This empirical approach particularly serves Christianity's evangelical mission, as it offers concrete reasoning rather than requiring a preliminary leap of faith. By grounding divine proof in observable reality, Aquinas provides tools for converting skeptics through rational discourse rather than spiritual conviction alone.",
            "Literary authors employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In analyzing \"The Great Gatsby,\" one discovers how its creator masterfully implements several such approaches. The text occasionally features unconventional pairings of descriptors with objects, creating unexpected imagery. Additionally, symbolic elements are carefully woven throughout the narrative to reinforce specific themes.\n\nAmong the most striking symbolic elements is the deliberate use of chromatic imagery. The narrative incorporates numerous hues - from aureate tones to emerald shades, from monochromatic whites and grays to various pink and crimson tints. This careful color orchestration serves to underscore deeper meanings throughout the work.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the application of the grayscale spectrum, ranging from pristine white to muted gray tones, which suggests conformity and social stratification. The brighter whites often denote affluence and sophistication, while grays typically represent aging or fading glory. This motif appears consistently throughout the narrative's opening sequences.\n\nCharacters frequently appear in ivory-colored attire - from the protagonist's acquaintances to party attendees. The only deviation occurs during the vivid party sequence, where primary colors dominate the scene. The author reinforces this color symbolism by applying it to mundane elements: metropolitan thoroughfares, guest registers, residential complexes - all described in various shades of white and gray.\n\nThis chromatic pattern extends to characterization, particularly regarding the female lead. Her appearances consistently feature these tones, from her clothing to her vehicle, gradually transforming her from a dynamic character into a symbol of societal conformity - merely another object of the protagonist's aspirations. This effect is reinforced through repeated references to pale and grayish tones in her descriptions, especially during pivotal scenes.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local producers cultivate an impressive array of crops, ranging from succulent tomatoes and vibrant citrus to fresh leafy vegetables, various squash varieties, and aromatic herbs. The region's fertile soil also supports fruit orchards, berry patches, apiaries, and pepper fields. Local residents demonstrate tremendous enthusiasm for community-supported organic agriculture, evidenced by extensive waitlists for farm memberships. The demand extends to organic dairy and poultry products, reflecting growing consumer consciousness.\n\nThese agricultural enterprises frequently combine food production with agritourism, welcoming visitors for educational tours and outdoor activities like hiking and wildlife observation. Such diversification allows proprietors to leverage governmental support while enhancing natural habitats and generating supplementary revenue streams through educational initiatives and recreational offerings.\n\nOrganic farming practices contribute significantly to environmental preservation by fostering diverse ecosystems. Nevertheless, this approach presents certain economic challenges. The absence of chemical interventions necessitates increased manual labor for pest control, weed management, and soil enrichment. Smaller organic operations often experience higher crop losses and reduced economies of scale compared to conventional farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, exotic species control, and habitat manipulation, further increase operational costs. These factors underscore the importance of accessing financial assistance and expert guidance to optimize both economic viability and ecological benefits.\n\nThe subject property encompasses 160 acres near Potrero, California, bordering Cleveland National Forest. This undeveloped parcel features chaparral vegetation, non-indigenous Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodlands. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecosystem, as defined by San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This initiative addresses numerous threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher, alongside potentially endangered species like burrowing owls.\n\nHistorical records indicate indigenous occupation spanning millennia, followed by nineteenth-century settlement by ranchers and wood merchants. The land's homestead patent origin suggests historical usage for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis examined current real estate listings and available government programs to evaluate viable options for small-scale agricultural operations emphasizing wildlife conservation, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "The relationship between siblings, particularly brothers, encompasses a complex web of emotions that creates an eternal connection. Such familial ties generate feelings ranging from affection and admiration to envy and hostility. No one comprehends a brother quite like another brother, as they serve as mirrors to each other's souls. Critical moments reveal the true essence of this connection, whether benevolent or malicious. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price. The fraternal bond demands not only understanding but also accepting the ramifications of actions driven by these powerful emotions. When siblings gaze upon one another, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than the facade presented to the world.\n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully illustrates this dynamic through its portrayal of two siblings navigating their relationship. Set against a richly detailed Southern backdrop, their story unfolds as an exercise in futility. The narrative culminates in a tragic scene where pride and disappointment collide, resulting in a devastating loss. The author conveys these themes through careful development of Doodle's character, the siblings' interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reveals his complicated emotional landscape and worldview.\n\nThe narrator's motivations stem primarily from an overwhelming sense of pride. His relationship with Doodle is tainted by disappointment from their earliest interactions. He had envisioned teaching a brother various physical activities, such as breath-holding contests, sprinting, and vine-climbing in Old Woman Swamp. His dreams included having a companion for races to Horsehead Landing and a partner for tree-climbing adventures in the towering pine behind their barn. These aspirations proved impossible due to Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival. The narrator's response to this reality manifested in disturbing ways, including contemplating infanticide by suffocation. Yet, Doodle's innocent smile penetrated this darkness, suggesting that beneath the narrator's resentment lay an innate, though complicated, brotherly affection.",
            "Our neural architecture represents an intricate system capable of processing vast amounts of data while demonstrating remarkable creativity. Throughout history, society's understanding of cognitive function has evolved alongside technological progress. Various analogies emerged - from ancient comparisons to wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, to more contemporary parallels with books and digital computers. Yet one must exercise caution, as these comparisons, while instructive, possess inherent limitations.\n\nThe cognitive process initiates when our sensory receptors convert physical phenomena - tactile sensations, thermal energy, acoustic waves, or light particles - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through dual-processing pathways. Consider observing a white canvas containing a dark square: elementary processing assembles basic elements like hue, directional alignment, and edge detection to construct the image. Simultaneously, higher-order processing expedites recognition by utilizing preliminary analytical results, helping distinguish between a solid object and negative space.\n\nCognitive filtration mechanisms evaluate incoming data streams, determining their significance and appropriate distribution across mental faculties. While your visual cortex processes countless grass blades within your field of view, selective attention typically suppresses individual blade recognition. Conversely, hearing your name across a crowded venue often triggers immediate recognition. This filtering process occurs continuously across multiple cognitive stages.\n\nData storage underlies all mental operations, manifesting in various forms including temporary sensory retention, active processing memory, and permanent storage. Initial data capture involves modality-specific encoding processes. For instance, verbal information storage encompasses physical appearance (structural), acoustic properties (phonemic), and conceptual significance (semantic). Research with various species indicates that short-term memory - lasting approximately twenty seconds - potentially relies on recurring electrical patterns within specific neural circuits. Long-term retention likely depends on protein structure modifications.\n\nMultiple theoretical frameworks attempt to explain knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent theory - the semantic network hypothesis - proposes interconnected concept nodes linked by relevance. Within this framework, conceptual relationships form naturally: \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" which links to \"wooden,\" creating an expansive associative network.",
            "The global financial landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2007 when a devastating economic crisis engulfed the United States. As businesses shuttered, homeowners faced foreclosure, and major institutions teetered on collapse, a complex web of factors emerged as the catalyst for this catastrophe. This economic turbulence continues to reverberate through our society, compelling us to examine its origins and preventive measures for the future. At its core, the crisis emerged from a perfect storm of misguided regulatory decisions, aggressive lending practices, and an inadequate financial framework that encouraged the proliferation of high-risk mortgages.\n\nThe seeds of economic instability were planted during the late 1990s, coinciding with presidential politics. In an effort to boost popularity, policymakers implemented more lenient lending guidelines, inadvertently setting the stage for future turmoil. Contemporary reporting by the New York Times' Steven Holmes highlighted mounting pressure on Fannie Mae to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes presciently warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nThe financial sector's increasing complexity contributed significantly to market instability. Novel financial instruments, including variable-rate mortgages and structured debt products, created intricate connections throughout the economy. This interconnectedness led to excessive exposure to real estate markets across multiple economic sectors, creating vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\nThe eventual collapse of the housing market triggered a devastating chain reaction throughout the financial system. Major investment banks reported staggering mortgage-related losses totaling $4.1 trillion in 2007, representing nearly one-third of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of Wall Street's most prestigious institutions. Government intervention became necessary for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which held $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, marking a pivotal moment in American financial history.",
            "Let's discuss the thorny issue of exposition in storytelling. While many writers view it as their chance to showcase literary prowess, it often becomes the point where reader engagement plummets. Even experienced authors like myself have caught themselves groaning at screens when confronted with information overload.\n\nExposition should never be your primary storytelling tool.\n\nWhile most writers understand the fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell,\" we frequently fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs or too much information is dumped at once. Think of exposition as that tempting voice suggesting you should front-load all the background information before getting to the interesting parts (though it's equally dangerous to succumb to the urge to detail every character's complete life story).\n\nIn essence, exposition delivers information directly to the reader. In movies, it manifests as those scenes where characters inexplicably narrate past events to each other. In written works, it's when authors directly feed information to readers.\n\nConsider this scenario: A narrative quickly summarizes how two characters met, married, and how one spouse died tragically - all within two pages and minimal dialogue. This approach does readers a disservice. Instead, the story should explore the husband's personality through his actions and words, demonstrating his devotion. It should illustrate how the relationship transformed both characters' lives. This deeper development allows readers to form emotional connections and better understand the surviving character's subsequent journey.\n\nThe difference lies between a bare-bones outline (\"They met, married, and parted\") and a fully realized narrative.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly list character traits like items on a grocery list. When introducing someone new - say, a former Air Force member now managing a gas station, twice divorced, weekend angler, aspiring business owner who enjoyed Eggs Benedict that morning - remember that character development requires more finesse than mere fact-dumping.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news broadcasts, specifically NBC 4's morning segment on August 13, 2011, several notable stories emerged. The broadcast opened with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended a suspect in connection with a multiple-stabbing case. The coverage was concise yet informative.\n\nSubsequently, they reported on an incident involving an 18-year-old victim of a shooting in the Sharon Woods district. The case, still under investigation by SWAT personnel, had no identified suspects at the time of reporting. The brevity of this coverage raised questions about potential media bias in crime reporting across different demographics.\n\nA particularly concerning story involved damage to emergency medical services equipment, specifically a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators determined the damage was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Local authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to an arrest.\n\nThe meteorological segment predicted precipitation and electrical storms for the upcoming Saturday, with temperature forecasts remaining moderate. This segment appeared deliberately abbreviated to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, where the suspect description received notably detailed attention. Additionally, they reported on a narcotics trafficking case involving an interstate operation between Texas and Ohio. The sentencing was unusually presented in months rather than years, potentially for dramatic effect.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, I observed particular patterns in how different stories received varying degrees of attention and detail, possibly reflecting underlying editorial biases.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent innovative financial instruments that mirror specific market segments, whether indices, commodities, or asset groups. These versatile securities combine the broad market exposure of traditional index funds with stock-like trading capabilities on major exchanges. Investors particularly value their ability to engage in margin trading, short selling, and fractional share purchases, while maintaining significantly reduced expense ratios compared to conventional mutual funds.\n\nDespite their numerous advantages, ETFs do present certain considerations, particularly the requirement to pay brokerage commissions on trades, similar to standard equity transactions. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully scrutinize claimed benefits, such as diversification effects, rather than accepting them at face value.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the healthcare-sector ETF IHF, comparing its characteristics against its principal components. We'll investigate whether holding the ETF provides comparable advantages to maintaining positions in its constituent stocks, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns or absolute performance.\n\nOur methodology concentrates on the fund's top ten positions, which collectively represent approximately 63.58% of total assets, as analyzing the complete holdings universe would prove impractical. These primary holdings and their respective allocations provide a representative sample for our investigation.\n\nTo assess how effectively these major components reflect IHF's overall profile, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the theoretical portfolio's beta coefficient and expected return. This approach enables direct comparison with the ETF's actual metrics.\n\nInitial findings reveal that a portfolio constructed solely from these primary holdings would have generated returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points (a 16% improvement) while maintaining a beta 0.12 lower than the fund itself. While these preliminary results suggest superior risk-adjusted performance from direct stock ownership, further statistical analysis becomes necessary to determine whether these differences are meaningful.\n\nTo establish statistical significance, we calculated normalized standard deviations for each component stock, enabling direct comparison with IHF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter participation during the project's third month. Several factors likely contributed to this unexpected downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our northeastern institution naturally discourages walking and cycling. Additionally, the academic calendar presents unique challenges, with December bringing final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties that compete for attention. The subsequent holiday break disperses our campus community, while the late January return to classes potentially explains that month's diminished participation rates. The February statistics, however, remain particularly puzzling.\n\nOne might reasonably attribute some decline to the natural enthusiasm curve of such initiatives, where initial excitement gradually wanes. Our team implemented a strategic response through the March Carpool Challenge Week, successfully boosting participation rates. This experience highlighted the necessity of maintaining momentum, particularly within the academic calendar's unique rhythm of intense activity and extended breaks.\n\nThe project faced an additional hurdle in America's deeply rooted car culture, which values personal autonomy and convenience. To counter this cultural preference, we implemented an incentive structure offering various rewards, including gift cards to regional establishments such as dining venues, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, the potential impact of more substantial prizes warrants consideration. The introduction of premium rewards - perhaps high-end bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - might have sustained engagement more effectively. A graduated prize structure, featuring increasingly valuable incentives throughout the project timeline, could have potentially reversed the observed participation decline. For instance, announcing the addition of bicycle prizes in December, followed by a hybrid vehicle reward in January, might have maintained or even enhanced participation levels rather than witnessing the documented decrease.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, specifically focusing on fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces employed clever editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unique variations across these productions, particularly noting how later examples began pushing traditional boundaries.\n\nThe majority of these early trick films followed specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a theater-like staging, maintained static camera positions, employed broader viewing angles, and typically contained just one continuous scene. Yet as the new century dawned, some bold filmmakers began experimenting with multiple scene transitions and other innovative techniques.\n\nA striking characteristic shared among these productions was their theatrical presentation style. Similar to stage performances of the era, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts, the camera remained fixed in a front-facing position, never following the performers' movements. This theatrical influence manifested clearly in the performers' movements, which typically occurred in lateral patterns rather than toward or away from the viewer. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame, never breaking the invisible fourth wall.\n\nThe staging approach naturally influenced shot composition, favoring wide and occasional medium-distance views while completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience, where audience members observed entire performances from a fixed vantage point. The actors maintained their position in the middle ground, preserving the stage-like atmosphere throughout the performance.\n\nMost productions adhered to a single-scene format, resulting in brief running times of approximately one minute. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, leading to an emphasis on short, entertaining tricks rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as one continuous shot often involved multiple takes cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) demonstrates this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate shots were combined to create the illusion of decapitation.",
            "Literary scholars often note that the Gothic Novel represents a fascinating paradox: a marriage between antiquity and modernity. This literary form, which emerged in the 18th century, has generated considerable debate regarding its merit and significance. Some dismiss it as superficial, while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nHorace Walpole's pioneering work, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" established the foundation for this genre by synthesizing elements from classical and contemporary storytelling traditions. His innovative approach incorporated theatrical devices from earlier periods while embracing the naturalistic tendencies of contemporary fiction. The term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations, referring variously to peoples, architectural styles, and historical epochs. During Walpole's time, many considered the gothic aesthetic outdated compared to the refined sensibilities of the Enlightenment era. However, the genre's unique combination of theatrical elements with novel-format psychological exploration has enabled its continued relevance across centuries.\n\nChivalric ideals feature prominently in Gothic literature, particularly in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" These medieval principles of knightly conduct undergo both preservation and transformation within the narrative. The emphasis on chivalry reflects a broader cultural nostalgia among Gothic authors, who often viewed their contemporary society as lacking the noble virtues of earlier ages. This perspective especially resonated with Walpole, who wrote during a period of political upheaval. His experiences in politics, marked by controversy and accusations, potentially influenced his portrayal of moral decay in contemporary society compared to an idealized medieval past.\n\nThis thematic concern manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. His characterization as a noble prince who endures hardship and faces presumed death at the hands of infidels exemplifies the genre's tendency toward dramatic amplification, establishing what would become a characteristic feature of Gothic literature.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and ultimate delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first articulated by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, represents a comprehensive approach to organizing, executing, and monitoring supply chain activities to maximize customer satisfaction through speed and efficiency. The framework consists of six fundamental components: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock management, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components strategically to deliver superior customer experiences.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes the framework for all subsequent activities, determining crucial aspects of production timing, rationale, location, and methodology. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the most reliable indicator of consumer demands. Upon completing market research and gaining clarity on customer needs, decision-makers can determine product specifications and quantities. Subsequently, they select optimal manufacturing facilities based on capacity and quality capabilities, while maintaining focus on meeting consumer expectations. The final manufacturing considerations involve work scheduling and equipment upkeep. The precision of manufacturing planning carries significant weight, as oversights can result in substantial financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail environments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nResource procurement, the second cornerstone, involves making strategic choices about core facility capabilities and external partnerships. Organizations often maintain multiple production divisions for single products, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division assignments for various production phases. Additionally, they may opt for external partnerships to enhance velocity - the capacity to deliver quality and adaptability while maintaining or reducing operational costs.",
            "The literary landscape of the Victorian era is widely recognized for its meticulous descriptive passages and its preoccupation with upper-class society. However, two notable exceptions to this pattern emerge in the form of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works distinguish themselves through their incorporation of mysterious elements and unconventional narratives, which serve to enhance character development and provide deeper understanding of their psychological states.\n\nConsider this passage from Oliver Twist: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth narratives employ dream sequences as a literary device, though each serves a distinct purpose. In Oliver Twist, these ethereal moments illuminate the protagonist's internal struggles and his growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's shooting scene, depicted through Oliver's semi-conscious state, exemplifies this technique. The dreamlike sequence emphasizes his powerlessness while highlighting his deteriorating physical condition, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting scene's sensory overload, coupled with Oliver's passive response to an \"unseen hand\" guiding him, underscores his lack of agency. This passivity raises questions about the forces shaping his destiny and suggests Fagin's growing influence over Oliver's spirit, manifesting in his inability to fight for self-preservation.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my experience as a tutor in an elementary after-school program, I encountered a fascinating case that highlighted an important educational challenge. While assisting students across various subjects, with particular expertise in literacy and language arts, I was assigned to work with a third-grade student named Adrian who exhibited unusual reading patterns.\n\nInitially, his reading difficulties seemed perplexing. Despite being a native English speaker of Hispanic heritage, Adrian demonstrated inconsistent letter recognition and pronunciation skills. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother during a day when most students were away on a field trip. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's primary exposure to written language had been through Spanish alphabet conventions.\n\nThis experience illuminates the complexities of language barriers in California's educational system, particularly how they manifest in unexpected ways. Even students who demonstrate verbal fluency in English may struggle with fundamental literacy skills due to their home language environment. While Adrian's case required focused instruction in English phonics and letter recognition, addressing broader language barriers in education demands a more comprehensive approach.\n\nResearch demonstrates that implementing dual-language programs benefits all students, not just English language learners. Studies indicate superior academic performance among children in two-way bilingual education compared to traditional monolingual instruction. While transitioning to such programs presents logistical challenges, particularly regarding staffing, practical solutions exist. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual, schools could employ specialized bilingual teaching assistants and support staff to facilitate this educational model.",
            "Throughout human history, cultures worldwide have grappled with the concept of higher powers and divine forces. Educational institutions, places of worship, and personal contemplation serve as vehicles for understanding these metaphysical questions. While many individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions without question, others staunchly reject supernatural beliefs, embracing a strictly materialistic worldview. The quest for spiritual understanding remains deeply personal, with individuals often exploring multiple belief systems throughout their lives. This universal journey reflects humanity's persistent search for meaning and enlightenment.\n\nDuring a peaceful afternoon on our veranda, I engaged in conversation with my father. The steady percussion of rainfall against the metal roofing provided a melancholic backdrop as we shared a moment of quiet companionship. Rivulets cascaded from the eaves, drenching the botanical arrangements below. When questioned about his preferred avian species, he mentioned the scarlet-plumed cardinal, his gaze distant and contemplative. His physical deterioration had become increasingly apparent - his attire hanging loosely, his once-full hair noticeably diminished. Words remained unspoken between us, both aware of impending loss but unable to articulate our emotions. Physical proximity offered comfort where language failed.\n\nHis departure occurred during the winter solstice, shortly after I celebrated my twenty-second year. Medical interventions prolonged his existence beyond initial prognoses, though their merit remained questionable given his extended suffering. This experience challenged my theological convictions; nocturnal solitude replaced evening prayers. Faith wavered in the face of seemingly senseless suffering.\n\nPersonal choice led me to absence during his final moments. The preservation of vibrant memories outweighed witnessing his departure. Understanding his character intimately, I recognized his preference to spare his offspring from such observations. Isolation became my refuge as I awaited inevitable news.\n\nCommunication networks failed during this critical juncture, leaving me in an information void.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideology, the agriculturalist and political figure John Taylor of Caroline stands prominent. His agricultural background, combined with his brief political endeavors, shaped him into a passionate advocate for individual liberties and governmental reform. Agricultural principles served as the foundation for his political philosophy, influencing his perspectives on everything from constitutional matters to judicial reform and state sovereignty.\n\nThe absence of entrenched traditions in America presented, according to Taylor, an unprecedented opportunity to establish genuine self-governance. He advocated for the interconnected nature of human rights, arguing that these fundamental liberties formed an inseparable network - compromise one, and the entire framework would deteriorate. Such rights, he maintained, must remain sacrosanct from governmental interference. While some spoke of humanity's natural state as favoring the physically strong and cunningly intelligent, Taylor envisioned civilization as requiring a different paradigm.\n\nTaylor's blueprint for an ideal society acknowledged humanity's moral complexity. His philosophical framework recognized both virtue and vice as inherent human qualities that must be considered in governmental design. He categorized beneficial principles as those supporting private ownership, agricultural advancement, and resistance to unchecked capitalism. Taylor theorized that proper governmental foundation could ensure equitable function despite leadership's inevitable self-interest. While he recognized self-interest as a universal motivator, he distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nAs a Constitutional literalist, Taylor advocated for severely restricted federal authority, limiting it strictly to explicitly granted powers. His concerns about federal overreach stemmed from fears of both financial burden and potential tyranny. Yet he cautioned against oversimplified Constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the founders' intent. Notably, he elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more explicit affirmation of state sovereignty over national unity.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, absorbing the scene before me with clinical detachment. Like a camera lens capturing raw data, my mind processed the visual input without attaching meaning or emotion. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness like leaves in a breeze, never settling long enough to take root.\n\nYears ago, I'd invested in an instructional text - \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" - following a colleague's recommendation. Since childhood, I'd harbored artistic aspirations, and this guide promised to unlock everything from basic techniques to cognitive processing. One particularly valuable lesson involved using a viewfinder to isolate subjects, transforming complex scenes into manageable compositions.\n\nBut in this moment, no artistic framework could contain what I witnessed. The sight commanded my complete attention, leaving me transfixed. Artists throughout history have been defined by their signature palettes - Picasso's blues, Monet's verdant landscapes, the vibrant spectrum of Renaissance masters. If I were to leave my mark on the artistic world, this scene before me would herald my defining period: studies in brown.\n\nWith surgical precision, I gripped my tool, executing the motion with deliberate control. The crystalline water spiraled elegantly, carrying away fragments of matter into the void. When the first attempt proved insufficient, I engaged the mechanism again, more urgently this time. Yet the stubborn mass remained anchored, mockingly immobile.\n\nThere I stood, standard-issue mop at the ready, corporate uniform complete with forest-green necktie, contemplating the unwelcome deposit some inconsiderate patron had left in the Rite Aid restroom. After several futile attempts at mechanical intervention, I resorted to manual measures, methodically wrapping my hand in protective layers of tissue. With the dignified resignation of someone performing an unpleasant but necessary duty, I approached the bowl like a surgeon preparing for a delicate procedure...",
            "Recent data reveals an alarming trend in vehicular fatalities among young drivers. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, indicates that neurological development plays a crucial role in driving capability. The combination of underdeveloped cognitive functions and limited driving experience creates a perfect storm of risk factors.\n\nStudies consistently demonstrate that novice drivers exhibit higher rates of dangerous driving behaviors, including excessive speed and loss of vehicle control. Moreover, peer influence significantly impacts driving outcomes. Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has established a direct link between passenger age demographics and collision frequency.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing programs to address these concerns, such measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem lies in the physiological and psychological readiness of young individuals to operate motor vehicles safely. Expert analysis, including research by behavioral scientist Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that risk-taking tendencies remain elevated until approximately age 20, as reported in USA Today.\n\nThe impending demographic surge of new drivers compounds this issue. As children of Baby Boomers reach driving age, the potential for increased accidents looms large. This demographic shift necessitates immediate policy intervention.\n\nA comprehensive solution would involve standardized national regulations establishing 18 as the minimum driving age. This framework could maintain current educational components while implementing stricter licensing requirements. The system would preserve supervised training requirements, such as those currently mandated in states like California, which requires 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven the consistency of accident statistics across state lines, federal oversight of driving age restrictions represents a logical approach to addressing this public safety concern. This proposed regulatory framework builds upon existing successful models while addressing current shortcomings in the system.",
            "An Investigation into Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) represents a fascinating intersection between neurology and auditory function. At its core, CAPD affects how individuals process auditory signals despite having normal hearing capabilities. The brain's interpretation mechanisms fail to properly decode incoming sound information, leading to various processing difficulties.\n\nThe condition's historical roots trace back to the 1950s, when scientists first identified what they termed \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking research emerged from Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who pioneered diagnostic methods. The field advanced significantly when Kimura developed dichotic testing protocols in 1961, establishing fundamental physiological models. By 1977, the disorder had garnered enough attention to warrant its first major scientific conference.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD experience diverse challenges. These may include difficulties with spatial sound orientation, sound pattern recognition, and the interpretation of vocal nuances. Some struggle to process sequential sounds or become overwhelmed when multiple acoustic events occur simultaneously. Unlike hearing impairment, CAPD specifically involves the brain's processing capabilities rather than the physical mechanisms of hearing.\n\nContemporary diagnostic approaches incorporate multiple assessment strategies. Healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists, employ various evaluation tools. These assessments might involve behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. While no singular diagnostic method currently exists, practitioners often utilize simultaneous auditory stimuli tests and measure acoustic signal responses to evaluate processing capabilities. The exact etiology remains unknown, necessitating ongoing research in this field.",
            "My aspiration to enter the field of social work stems from a deep-seated desire to make a meaningful impact through the Division of Family and Children Services, specifically focusing on protecting vulnerable children and supporting families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy interpersonal dynamics while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nMy journey toward this calling wasn't immediately clear. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with various challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping strategies. This observation led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. The pivotal moment came during a chance encounter that summer when I met a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse. The subsequent interaction with law enforcement and the teen's parents, who dismissed serious concerns as \"simple disputes,\" crystallized my purpose. Their dismissive attitude and apparent nervousness when confronted about their behavior reinforced my determination to advocate for vulnerable youth through social work.\n\nThe pursuit of social justice stands as another cornerstone of my professional aspirations. Contemporary society presents an interesting paradox - while we claim to value individuality, there's an underlying pressure to conform to predetermined norms. My personal response to this contradiction has been consistent advocacy for authentic self-expression and opposition to discriminatory practices. Throughout my academic career, I actively challenged societal constraints through various forms of self-expression and involvement in organizations like GSBA. My commitment to confronting discrimination and promoting equality remains unwavering, as I believe these elements are fundamental to creating meaningful social change.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through two distinct frameworks: the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives. While biological analysis centers on genetic inheritance and medical conditions, sociocultural examination delves into environmental factors, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic influences. This analysis explores these perspectives through various research studies, evaluating their relative merits and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders fall into several classifications. They may manifest as primary conditions, emerge alongside other mental health issues, or develop due to external factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass two main categories: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias include six distinct conditions, with Primary Insomnia - characterized by persistent sleep difficulties lasting at least one month - being the most common. In contrast, Parasomnias involve unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep, such as nightmares, night terrors, or sleepwalking.\n\nRecent neurological research has revealed fascinating insights into sleep regulation. Scientists have discovered that specific neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, play a crucial role in maintaining sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with rodents have identified GABAB receptors on these neurons as key regulators of sleep states. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, they observed increased sleep promotion. Furthermore, the administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, resulted in extended sleep duration. These findings suggest potential genetic predispositions to sleep disorders and highlight how inherited receptor variations might influence an individual's sleep patterns, potentially impacting their daily functioning, academic performance, and professional life.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating our expansive campus. The issue of transportation became particularly evident during my initial year when I resided in East Halls. The journey from my accommodation in Stuart Hall to centrally located facilities like Willard Building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nThe campus landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent years. According to alumni accounts, East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast undeveloped areas. Today, these spaces have been transformed into athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, and residential complexes. This continuous expansion has intensified the transportation challenges faced by students.\n\nIn addressing these mobility concerns, bicycles emerge as the optimal solution for campus transportation. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after an extended break. Their enthusiasm was evident: \"I can't believe I ever stopped cycling. Despite its fluctuating popularity, it's truly the most practical transportation method.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling represents remarkable efficiency in transportation. The energy from a simple breakfast can power a cyclist for dozens of miles.\n\nAs an off-campus resident situated at a distance comparable to some university housing, I've found my bicycle investment invaluable. My daily commute to Thomas Building, which would normally require 25 minutes by foot, takes merely 5 minutes by bicycle at a brisk pace. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my academic schedule demands greater efficiency. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 150 minutes weekly when considering various campus commitments - proves essential for maintaining a balanced academic schedule.",
            "In his seminal work Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a dystopian society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes individualism, and the pursuit of instant gratification becomes the primary driving force of human existence. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere pieces in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA close analysis through Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about societal development and economic systems. The text employs various concepts central to Marxist thought, such as class uniformity and objectification, suggesting that Huxley sought to critique the emerging economic paradigms of his era.\n\nThe novel's treatment of social conditioning mirrors the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - exemplify this through their programmed behavior, achieved through sleep-learning techniques that instill consumerist values. This systematic manipulation, orchestrated by the ruling class, demonstrates social dominance theory in action. The privileged classes, while potentially aware of this system, largely maintain their complicity, with few exceptions like Bernard questioning the established order.\n\nThe absence of meaningful interpersonal connections throughout the narrative serves as a powerful metaphor. Characters lack psychological complexity, suggesting that technological progress and consumer culture have stripped humanity of its essential nature. Emotional depth is replaced by superficial interactions, evidenced by the purely physical nature of relationships between men and women. Each social stratum's acceptance of their predetermined role reflects the economic impact of consumer capitalism, where individuals are pacified through false promises of fulfillment through consumption and conformity.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that delved into Islamic studies. A recurring theme throughout the semester centered on the perception of Islam in modern society. This discussion has only gained significance in contemporary times. The media's portrayal of Islam has undergone a remarkable transformation since the tragic events of September 2001, shifting from overt skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation. The political landscape has similarly evolved, as evidenced by the unprecedented acceptance of candidates with Islamic heritage.\n\nUpon examining the traditional biographical accounts of Muhammad, I encountered what appeared to be significant discrepancies between historical records and religious narratives. Historical documentation suggests a military leader who expanded his influence through conquest, yet religious texts paint a portrait of a humble spiritual guide whose followers came to him voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nThe biographical accounts contain numerous parallels to Christian scripture, particularly in the description of supernatural events. One notable example describes the multiplication of food, reminiscent of similar Biblical narratives. These parallels raise questions about the authenticity and potential motivations behind such accounts, particularly in their apparent attempt to establish religious legitimacy through familiar miraculous motifs.\n\nThe methodology of documentation in these biographical accounts relies heavily on chains of oral transmission, with stories passed through multiple intermediaries before being recorded. While this system was intended to establish credibility, it potentially introduces questions about the reliability of such accounts, as information may have been altered through multiple retellings.\n\nThe disparity between historical evidence and religious narrative regarding Muhammad's character and methods presents a challenging dichotomy. The peaceful, humble figure portrayed in religious texts seems at odds with historical accounts of military campaigns and territorial expansion, raising questions about historical accuracy versus religious interpretation.",
            "In examining the trajectory of Christian theology, one observes a significant divergence between the original teachings of Christ and subsequent doctrinal developments. This historical evolution demonstrates how religious institutions often drift from their foundational principles. Contemporary society exhibits an increasing intellectual curiosity and progressive mindset, though conservative elements persist in maintaining traditional interpretations. These traditionalists, while vocal, may lack the numerical strength to prevent inevitable change.\n\nThe coming decades will likely witness an unprecedented surge in historical consciousness among Christian adherents. This awakening will spark a widespread desire to differentiate between later theological additions and Christ's original message. Though this transformation may span generations, its culmination appears certain: Christianity will experience a fundamental realignment with its roots.\n\nThis theological reformation will systematically deconstruct accumulated doctrine, essentially reversing centuries of theological evolution. The end result may be a stripped-down faith, focused purely on Jesus's divine message, unencumbered by subsequent interpretations. As this movement gains momentum across Western nations, encouraging worship patterns reminiscent of first-century practices, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their relevance while guiding this transformation. Paradoxically, this retrograde movement will likely reduce the current denominational fragmentation, fostering greater uniformity in belief and practice.\n\nHistorical precedents for such dramatic reversals exist: consider Rome's transformation from persecutor to promoter of Christianity, or America's evolution from slavery to racial inclusion in leadership. This impending religious reformation will be facilitated by adopting metaphorical rather than literal interpretations of Jesus's teachings.\n\nExamining Christianity's origins reveals its emergence from Judaism, which by 63 BCE had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority under Roman occupation. The Jewish community of this period was notably diverse, encompassing various sects including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through a careful analysis of The Jungle, one can observe a compelling portrayal of humanity's inherent tendency toward self-interest and avarice. The narrative expertly illustrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of power, consistently prioritize personal gain over collective welfare. This dynamic manifests most prominently in the industrial leadership's behavior.\n\nThe factory proprietors and administrators demonstrate an unwavering focus on expansion and profit maximization, displaying minimal concern for collateral damage. As Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery effectively conveys the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization. The administration's indifference extends to both environmental degradation and sanitation issues, including the widespread contamination from livestock facilities throughout Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation of human capital represents another facet of this systemic dysfunction. As the text states, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The absence of labor protection legislation during this period enabled widespread worker exploitation, including arbitrary terminations and hazardous working conditions.\n\nThe residents of Packingtown endured these deplorable circumstances without recourse to protective agencies or advocacy organizations. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than protected their members. The text draws a powerful parallel between these workers and chattel slavery: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Literary scholars have long debated the influences behind Edgar Allan Poe's haunting poem \"Dream-Land.\" The work, which incorporates the mysterious term \"Thulé,\" demonstrates fascinating connections to both classical and contemporary sources. While some academics point to Virgil's use of the term - referring to a mythical northern island beyond Britain - a compelling argument exists for more recent inspirations.\n\nThe German literary tradition, particularly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's masterwork \"Faust,\" offers intriguing parallels. Within \"Faust Part Two\" (1832), we find \"The King of Thulé,\" a melancholic ballad about a grieving monarch who, after his queen's death, receives a golden goblet as her final gift. The narrative concludes with the king's dramatic suicide after disposing of this precious memento in the ocean's depths.\n\nThe thematic resonance between Goethe's ballad and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is striking. Both works explore realms of profound loss, isolation, and psychological torment. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" traverses a colorless landscape populated by spectral memories, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's bereaved king. Poe's repeated use of \"Thulé\" - appearing at both the beginning and end of the poem - creates a symbolic framework that echoes the German master's exploration of mortality and despair.\n\nGoethe's influence on nineteenth-century literature was considerable, and Poe's awareness of his work seems certain. Not only was Goethe highly regarded by Alfred Tennyson, whom Poe deeply respected, but numerous English adaptations of his works circulated in American literary circles. H.P. Grattan's 1842 dramatic adaptation of \"Faust\" preceded Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by mere months, suggesting a direct line of influence.",
            "Examining Punitive Damages in California Premises Liability: Analysis of Customer Injury Due to Management Negligence\n\nThis analysis explores whether punitive damages could be justified in a slip-and-fall incident where store management demonstrated potential negligence. The case involves D&D Markets, where customer Jennifer Palmer sustained serious injuries after falling on an unremediated applesauce spill.\n\nThe incident timeline reveals concerning management behavior. At approximately 5:00 PM, employee Rich Wayne reported the hazard to manager Paul Martin. Fifteen minutes later, staff member Mary J. Haddigan reiterated this safety concern. In both instances, Martin dismissed the warnings, citing his dinner break as precedence. The plaintiff's injury occurred at 5:30 PM, marking a 30-minute window of inaction. Notably, D&D Markets had documented five similar incidents within the same calendar year.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 3294(a) establishes that punitive damages may be awarded upon demonstration of \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute further clarifies that malicious conduct encompasses actions showing \"willful and conscious disregard\" for others' safety. Precedent established in Taylor v. Superior Court emphasizes that awareness of probable dangers, coupled with deliberate failure to address them, constitutes malicious conduct.\n\nGiven these parameters, the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages warrants consideration. The manager's repeated dismissal of safety warnings, particularly in light of the establishment's history of similar incidents, suggests conscious disregard for customer safety. While proving \"despicable\" conduct presents a higher hurdle, the pattern of negligence and prioritization of personal convenience over customer safety provides substantial grounds for the claim to proceed.\n\nBased on these factors, summary dismissal of the punitive damages claim would be inappropriate, as sufficient evidence exists to support the plaintiff's position.",
            "The emptiness first manifested during her early adolescence. At fourteen, an inexplicable void took residence in her heart, persisting well into her seventeenth year. Time revealed that this yearning wasn't for an object but for companionship, though not in any conventional sense. Despite numerous admirers and awkward courtships, no male suitor sparked her interest. This peculiarity prompted considerable self-reflection, yet years of introspection yielded no satisfactory explanation for her apparent immunity to teenage romance.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere in which she grew up was remarkably serene. Her parents exemplified harmony, rarely engaging in disputes. The only source of tension arose from their daughter's fierce independence, which contrasted sharply with their placid nature. Her vibrant personality and genuine kindness made her universally appealing, creating an interesting dynamic within their peaceful household.\n\nThe tranquility shattered one afternoon when an agonized cry echoed from the kitchen. Racing toward the sound, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, clearly in distress. Between labored breaths, her mother managed to request immediate medical attention. Drawing upon her strength training, she carefully lifted her injured parent and transported her to their vehicle, laying her across the back seat before heading to the emergency room.\n\nThe hospital's sterile environment barely registered as she rushed through the entrance, calling urgently for medical assistance. Healthcare professionals quickly surrounded them, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination. Left alone in the waiting area, anxiety consumed her thoughts as she recalled the simple accident that precipitated this crisis - her mother's unfortunate fall from a stepstool while reaching for a decorative vase in their highest cabinet.",
            "Recent research investigated the correlation between cardiovascular health outcomes and compliance with Mediterranean-style eating patterns, as quantified by the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) scoring system. The traditional Mediterranean dietary approach emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes while incorporating healthy fats from sources like fish and nuts. This eating pattern limits animal products and saturated fats but permits reasonable alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated promising connections between Mediterranean eating patterns and improved cardiovascular outcomes, including reduced mortality rates. Additionally, clinical trials have shown advantages over conventional low-fat diets regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles among overweight participants. However, the specific impact on stroke risk remained relatively unexplored.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals aged 38-63 years, all participants in the broader Nurses' Health Study encompassing 121,700 women across 11 states. None had pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or diabetes. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers evaluated dietary habits through periodic food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), maintaining an impressive 95% participant retention rate. The study team verified reported cardiovascular events through medical documentation, though approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks were classified as \"probable\" cases due to limited record availability.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of aMed scores across multiple questionnaires. The analysis incorporated various health and lifestyle factors, including exercise habits, smoking status, and hormone therapy use. Statistical evaluation employed Cox proportional-hazard models to examine relationships between dietary patterns and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective effects associated with stronger Mediterranean diet adherence. Over two decades of observation, researchers documented 2,391 coronary events, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths. Participants with the highest aMed scores demonstrated a 29% lower risk of both coronary events and strokes compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A lone figure emerges on an urban corner - actress Ellen Page (known for her role in Juno) holding aloft a makeshift cardboard sign. Its message is jarring: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has languished under military dictatorship since a 1962 governmental overthrow. The nation witnessed unprecedented civil unrest in 2007 when Buddhist monastics initiated what became known as the \"Saffron Revolution\" - named for their distinctive orange-hued garments. As public participation swelled, initial government tolerance gave way to systematic violence against religious institutions nationwide. International media faced severe restrictions; notably, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai lost his life documenting these events on September 27th. While official statistics cite merely 13 casualties, military defector Colonel Hla Win revealed a far grimmer reality: \"The actual death count reaches thousands.\"\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine mandate for absolute power. Japanese imperial mythology elevated rulers to divine status. Even modern governance shows concerning parallels, as evidenced by certain political-religious alliances in contemporary America.\n\nHistorical precedents abound: China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 saw casualties ranging from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000. The 1994 Rwandan crisis witnessed government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany's regime represents perhaps the most infamous example of systematic state-sponsored persecution.",
            "The remarkable impact of Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his extended career and exceptional talent for orchestral innovation. While his piano work often maintains a reserved presence in many compositions, his true genius manifested in creating intricate musical arrangements that capitalized on his musicians' unique strengths. The framework he developed allowed for both spontaneous improvisation and meticulously arranged sections, carefully designed to showcase the distinctive styles of individual performers.\n\nThe orchestral landscape he painted demonstrated an extraordinary understanding of collective sound dynamics. His ability to weave together individual talents into a cohesive ensemble resulted in groundbreaking jazz compositions that continue to influence musicians today.\n\nAccording to Grove Music's scholarly analysis, compositions like \"Creole Love Call\" exemplify his revolutionary approach to incorporating vocals as an instrumental element. This piece, structured as a twelve-bar blues with six distinct choruses, demonstrates his masterful arrangement techniques:\n\nThe initial chorus presents an interplay between vocals and reed instruments, transitioning from smooth to textured tones.\nFollowing this, a muted trumpet emerges with elaborate blue note expressions.\nThe third section features an ethereal clarinet solo, accompanied by delicate piano rhythms.\nA full orchestral interpretation of the opening theme appears in the fourth chorus.\nThe piece reaches its apex in the fifth chorus with high-register reed sections leading the call-and-response.\nThe final chorus mirrors the opening structure but incorporates instrumental-style vocal techniques.\nThe composition concludes with a brief coda featuring vocal flourishes and unconventional trombone elements.\n\nThis innovative approach to vocal integration appears consistently throughout his repertoire. In \"Hot and Bothered\" (1928), Ellington masterfully combines Miley's trumpet work with Cox's vocal scatting, creating an unprecedented tonal fusion. This experimental approach continued in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Nanton's trombone work introduces the memorable melody with distinctive muted effects.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary trajectories in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the mechanisms that guide evolutionary modifications. Despite significant advances since D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 observation regarding the lack of mathematical descriptions for biological forms, contemporary researchers still grapple with similar challenges. Recent developments have incorporated mathematical frameworks to analyze mollusk shell development across both individual growth and evolutionary timescales, as demonstrated by researchers like Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur research investigates Prunum species, integrating mathematical modeling with empirical studies to understand developmental and evolutionary patterns. Through X-ray imaging, we identified measurable characteristics that enabled us to model both theoretical and actual shell configurations using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By generating theoretical morphologies, we established potential morphological boundaries within Prunum. These computational results, combined with laboratory observations, enhance our comprehension of major evolutionary transitions in this group.\n\nGastropod shells exhibit a fascinating architectural pattern: a tubular structure that coils through space in 360-degree rotations. These rotational segments, termed whorls, encircle a central columella. The growth rate between whorls varies, with visible suture lines marking whorl boundaries. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically represents the largest section, while preceding whorls constitute the spire. The shell structure extends from the apex (uppermost point) to the base, featuring an aperture through which the organism emerges.\n\nShell morphology can be examined from multiple perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard scientific illustration presents shells in apertural view, displaying the opening while oriented apex-upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a standardized protocol. Beginning with an apical perspective, researchers identify the initial suture point and establish a reference line. Whorl counts proceed from this marker, measured to quarter-whorl precision.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a temporal sequence of apertures, tracking the organism's shell secretion process. This growth pattern can be mapped using aperture center coordinates and dimensional measurements, enabling both visual and mathematical representation. Such mathematical frameworks facilitate the exploration of various developmental scenarios through parameter modification.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's statistics regarding newborn and infant deaths have shown minimal change. Despite making progress on various Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation sectors, improvements in both child and maternal wellness fall significantly behind the benchmarks established for 2015. Several factors contribute to these deficiencies, suggesting that a comprehensive healthcare reform might prove more beneficial than isolated program-based solutions.\n\nAlthough Indonesia now reports that 72% of childbirths involve qualified healthcare personnel, this figure warrants closer examination. The classification encompasses traditional birthing assistants, including local midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications such as severe bleeding during delivery. Thus, while the statistics appear promising, they mask underlying inadequacies in the system. Furthermore, recent trends show fewer children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrheal conditions, and available information suggests inadequate post-birth care nationwide.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% overall. More troubling is the stark urban-rural divide, with cities reporting 7% cesarean deliveries compared to just 2% in rural regions. This disparity highlights a broader issue of healthcare accessibility, which heavily favors urban populations. Economic inequality further compounds this problem, with a 27-percentage-point difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely due to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant care metrics, policymakers face a crucial decision between targeted interventions and broad healthcare system improvements. While specialized programs offer clear objectives and quick wins, they come with significant drawbacks. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health services and attract healthcare workers away from general practice. Moreover, multiple parallel initiatives frequently result in redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, as evidenced by the impact of HIV/AIDS funding on family planning resources.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing numerous genres that defy simple categorization. Each primary genre - whether it's rap, rock, country, jazz, or folk - has branched into countless subgenres, creating an intricate musical tapestry. Among these, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly fascinating, having evolved into one of popular music's most complex and emotionally charged genres since its emergence four decades ago.\n\nHeavy Metal's emotional palette, while predominantly exploring darker themes, demonstrates remarkable range and depth. The genre's adaptability became evident shortly after its inception, as musicians began experimenting with its foundations, spawning successive waves of subgenres. This continuous evolution persists to this day, creating an ever-expanding musical universe.\n\nContemporary Heavy Metal presents such diversity that defining its core characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has absorbed influences from various musical traditions, understanding its origins remains crucial. To truly grasp modern metal's significance, one must examine it not merely as a genre but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAt its essence, Heavy Metal embodies intensity and excess - in volume, instrumental proficiency, theatrical presentation, and emotional expression. Unlike some genres, metal demands technical mastery; its practitioners consistently demonstrate exceptional musicianship. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic revolution of the 1970s, when drug experimentation led to groundbreaking sonic innovations. Metal distinguished itself by embracing darker themes at a time when mainstream music generally avoided such territory. Modern metal continues to draw inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic Era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles - often cited as an early metal prototype. Created as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcased the band's ability to venture into darker territory, featuring themes of destabilization commonly associated with drug experiences. Its inclusion on The White Album marked a significant moment in metal's prehistory.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, preceding the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously creating visual narratives that transcended conventional artistic boundaries. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, exemplifies both the literal representation of a woman experiencing an enchanted vision and symbolizes Rousseau's personal aspirations within the artistic community. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau grappled with a fundamental challenge: whether to embrace established artistic conventions to gain acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nUnderstanding this artistic tension requires examination of Rousseau's background. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, he emerged from a middle-class environment, with his father operating a successful hardware business. Notably, Rousseau's artistic journey deviated from traditional paths, as he lacked formal training and spent his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly, with the loss of eight children in infancy and his first wife, Clémence, leaving him to raise his surviving daughter Julia alone. Art became his sanctuary and means of emotional restoration.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries who idealized rural life in their works, Rousseau maintained an authentic folk-art perspective, reflecting the genuine aspirations and experiences of his social class. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of prominent modern artists like Matisse. According to art historian Jan Gordon's \"Modern French Painters,\" while Matisse actively sought to challenge artistic conventions, Rousseau paradoxically strived for acceptance through conformity to established artistic standards, hoping to gain membership in the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers and scholars have observed striking parallels between moral principles and artistic expression, suggesting these domains share fundamental connections. This relationship becomes apparent when examining how humans process both ethical decisions and aesthetic experiences. While traditional learning occurs through structured education or direct experience, our understanding of morality and beauty seems to emerge from a deeper, more intuitive source.\n\nWhen analyzing either ethical principles or artistic merit, we typically focus on describing existing phenomena rather than establishing rigid guidelines. Critics and philosophers attempt to explain why certain actions feel morally correct or why particular artworks resonate with viewers, instead of creating strict rulebooks for moral behavior or artistic creation.\n\nInterestingly, neither artistic criticism nor ethical analysis can fully capture the essence of their subjects. Consider discussions about masterpieces like the Mona Lisa – while experts may analyze technical elements such as composition and historical significance, these aspects alone cannot explain its enduring impact. Similarly, when people discuss their favorite artistic works, they often preface detailed analysis with intuitive responses, suggesting an ineffable quality beyond technical description.\n\nThis transcendent aspect appears in both artistic appreciation and moral understanding. Literary works, in particular, demonstrate this connection most clearly. Unlike other art forms, literature inherently incorporates moral dimensions, as it reflects human experiences and value systems. The written word serves as a unique bridge between aesthetic beauty and ethical contemplation, allowing us to explore complex moral territories through artistic expression.\n\nThe profound connection between ethics and aesthetics stems from their shared appeal to our intuitive understanding. Both domains affect us at a level beyond rational explanation, operating in what philosophers might call the realm of pure experience. This special characteristic, this indefinable quality, creates a natural bond between moral truth and artistic beauty, particularly evident in literary works where human values and artistic expression seamlessly intertwine.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a unified nation, its distinctive cultural fabric woven seamlessly from Munich's alpine foothills to the northern ports of Kiel on the Baltic coast. This cultural tapestry extends from Cologne's Rhine-side boulevards through the heartland to Dresden's baroque splendor along the Elbe. The rich mosaic of contemporary German identity reflects its diverse origins, emerging from numerous historical tribes and principalities.\n\nThe ancestral homeland, historically termed Germania, carries a name whose origins spark scholarly debate. Historical records indicate various potential etymologies. According to Roman accounts, particularly those of Tacitus, the term derived from a tribe called the Tungri, who had previously been known as \"Germans\" before their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\" introduced \"Germanus\" into Roman literature, adopting Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples beyond the Rhine. Linguistic scholars propose alternative origins, suggesting connections to ancient weaponry terminology (the \"ger\" spear) or Celtic linguistic roots meaning \"neighbor\" or \"shouter.\"\n\nTacitus's ethnographic work \"Germania\" (98 CE) presents a fascinating perspective on these peoples, describing them as indigenous to their territories and relatively unmixed with other populations. He emphasizes the region's forbidding nature, questioning why anyone would choose such harsh terrain over Mediterranean comforts unless it were their native land.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania developed primarily through commerce and military recruitment rather than settlement. While Roman expeditions ventured into Germanic territories for resources and campaigns, permanent Roman settlement remained limited. Germanic tribes, establishing themselves during the first century CE, maintained a complex relationship with the Empire, engaging in trade and military service while preserving their independence along Roman frontiers.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores the complex relationship between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The resolution of such pretense often forces an uncomfortable choice: maintaining personal integrity versus preserving social bonds. When deceptions unravel, reactions vary dramatically – some shrug it off, while others experience deep betrayal.\n\nThe gender-bending elements of the narrative raise particularly intriguing questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine attire emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy inadvertently severs potential female friendships and creates romantic complications.\n\nThese complications manifest most notably in Olivia's misplaced affections – \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138) – and in Orsino's conflicted emotions: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261). Contemporary audiences might interpret these entanglements as Shakespeare's commentary on fluid sexuality and hidden desires. However, Olivia's swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a different reading: rather than exploring latent same-sex attraction, Shakespeare appears to satirize superficial attraction based purely on appearance.\n\nThis interpretation gains credence through Olivia's eventual acceptance of Viola as family rather than lover: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). The resolution demonstrates how deception, while temporarily useful for unveiling suppressed emotions, must ultimately yield to authentic relationships based on truth.",
            "Historical accounts frequently highlight the harsh nature of German colonial administration, particularly regarding the tragic events involving the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, painting an entire colonial empire with a single brush would be an oversimplification. The reality reveals a tapestry of administrative approaches across different territories, including varying educational strategies.\n\nWhen examining educational outcomes, fascinating contrasts emerge. Following their 1919 acquisition of German East Africa (Tanganyika), British administrators encountered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun by writers of the period. However, the educational landscape in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) tells a markedly different story.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational initiatives seen in East Africa, South West African indigenous education relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal governmental assistance. Interestingly, the administration allocated substantial resources toward European education in the territory, establishing government schools and providing enhanced support for missionary institutions serving white settlers. These educational disparities created lasting implications. While other former German territories produced numerous educated indigenous individuals, South West Africa's native population remained largely unexposed to formal education. Multiple factors contributed to this unique situation, warranting further investigation into settler attitudes and administrative policies.\n\nScholarly literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, predominantly consisting of German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused primarily on describing educational frameworks, while subsequent English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. Cohen's research comparing South West African and East African education systems stands out, suggesting that South West Africa's substantial settler population significantly influenced its educational development.\n\nThe territory's relatively moderate climate, despite its predominantly desert landscape, attracted a significant European presence. By 1913, South West Africa hosted nearly 15,000 European settlers, almost triple the white population of East Africa, the next most populated German colony.",
            "During the mid-19th century, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that lasted nearly six decades, from 1836 until 1893. This period of strained relations reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in America's acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Conflicts persisted between these neighboring nations until shortly before World War I, stemming from fundamental differences in faith, societal values, and economic interests.\n\nBorder conflicts frequently characterize relationships between adjacent countries, and the Mexican-American dynamic proves no exception. Historical records indicate that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba maintained prolonged diplomatic tensions with the United States, largely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in this historical antagonism. Just as 20th-century Americans opposed totalitarian ideologies, their 18th and 19th-century predecessors harbored strong anti-Catholic sentiments. This religious divide mirrors other historical conflicts, such as the ideological component of U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War. The seeds of this religious antipathy trace back to Anglo-Spanish rivalries, which both nations inherited from their respective colonial powers.\n\nHistorical documentation reveals 17 distinct confrontations between these nations during their 57-year period of rivalry. Most incidents involved cross-border violence and frontier-related disputes. Both countries eventually deployed military forces along their shared border to address persistent bandit activity targeting frontier settlements.\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic ties with the United States. By the century's end, American interests had shifted from territorial expansion to commercial investment in Mexico, fundamentally altering the relationship between these neighboring nations.",
            "In 2008, my life transformed dramatically when a rare medical condition struck without warning. At the time, I was working in healthcare, having chosen the field primarily for its promise of job security - a decision driven by my unstable childhood. Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I followed the conventional wisdom that medical professions would always be in demand.\n\nThe irony wasn't lost on me when, at age 46, I found myself unable to work, single, and financially vulnerable. Now, after more than a decade receiving disability benefits, I've watched my personal assets dwindle to practically nothing. Each day presents new challenges to my dignity and sense of security. However, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. When crisis strikes, even the strongest among us need helping hands.\n\nLife's uncertainties - whether minor inconveniences or major catastrophes - will always exist. No amount of preparation can fully insulate us from needing assistance when truly significant challenges arise.\n\nWhile I support reducing dependence on government institutions (which have certainly shown their limitations), I believe the solution lies in strengthening community bonds rather than retreating into individual fortresses. The narrative of America being built on \"rugged individualism\" overlooks a crucial historical fact: our ancestors survived through cooperation and resource-sharing. Consider the westward expansion - those wagon trains succeeded through collective effort, not isolation.\n\nI'm certainly an advocate for emergency preparedness. My own home contains disaster supplies: medical kits, water treatment supplies, protective materials, emergency lighting, and shelf-stable food. For those with the means, maintaining a small farm or installing alternative heating sources makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever, the most valuable preparation might be simply reaching out to those living nearby. Community resilience often proves more sustainable than individual readiness.",
            "The origins of Buddhism can be traced to approximately 500 BCE, when an individual later known as the Buddha emerged from princely origins. His journey toward enlightenment and subsequent teachings established what would evolve into various Buddhist traditions, with Theravada emerging as the most traditional branch. As with any ancient faith spanning millennia, modern Buddhist practice has undergone significant transformations. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual performed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony absent from original Buddhist teachings, yet embraced by both religious officials and ordinary practitioners alike. Such evolutionary changes extend beyond mere customs to influence fundamental religious principles. The Buddhist faith community has adapted its core teachings in response to various influences, both from within and without, some supportive and others challenging.\n\nTo properly analyze these changes, we must establish clear definitions. When examining influences, we distinguish between those originating from within the Buddhist community (internal) and those from non-Buddhist sources (external). Additionally, we categorize these forces as either antagonistic - seeking to undermine Buddhist practice - or neutral, which may inadvertently impact the faith despite having no explicit agenda regarding Buddhism.\n\nUnderstanding contemporary Theravada Buddhism requires familiarity with its foundational elements. Central to the faith is devotion to three primary aspects: the enlightened teacher, his message, and the monastic community. Buddhist scripture is organized into three collections: discourses, monastic regulations, and philosophical teachings. Key philosophical concepts include the absence of a permanent self, life's inherent challenges, and universal impermanence. Recognition of these principles is considered essential for breaking free from the continuous cycle of existence, thereby eliminating negative qualities such as craving, animosity, and misconception. The religious code prescribes different levels of commitment - lay practitioners follow five basic moral guidelines, while monastics adhere to more extensive regulations. The framework of Buddhism rests upon four fundamental realities: life contains suffering, attachment breeds suffering, liberation from suffering is possible, and there exists a path toward such liberation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new.

Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation process, cultural dynamics emerge as a crucial factor. The concept of culture defies simple categorization; it's a complex tapestry that cannot be reduced to stereotypes or broad generalizations. Rather than making sweeping assumptions like \"Europeans are direct\" or \"Asians are indirect,\" successful negotiators recognize the nuanced impact of cultural influences on business discussions. When individuals encounter different cultural frameworks, they inevitably filter these experiences through their own cultural lens, creating a natural comparative analysis.\n\nSuccessfully navigating cultural differences requires deep engagement, from exploring historical contexts to understanding inherent biases. Instead of critiquing or attempting to modify cultural norms, effective negotiators adapt their approach to work within established cultural parameters. This becomes particularly critical when operating from a position of lesser leverage or when conducting negotiations in unfamiliar territory. Demonstrating cultural sensitivity and respecting local customs often serves as a bridge across cultural divides.\n\nCultural distinctions extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each business entity typically develops its distinctive organizational ethos. This manifests in various ways: work-life balance expectations, communication protocols, attire requirements, and charitable engagement policies. Even within a single nation, corporate cultures can vary dramatically between organizations, and sometimes between different locations of the same company. While some societies might present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals subtle but significant internal variations.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides insight into cultural motivations. In societies where maintaining harmony or preserving dignity is paramount, negotiators typically avoid actions that could cause public embarrassment. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures might focus more on securing optimal terms than swift resolution. While these cultural patterns provide valuable context, successful negotiators also invest time in understanding their counterparts' individual perspectives and motivations.",
            "In both Psalm 14 and the philosophical works of Anselm and Aquinas, we encounter the dismissal of atheistic thought. When comparing these two medieval theologians' perspectives on proving God's existence, we must operate within their shared theological framework - specifically, the Christian conception of deity. Any broader interpretation would muddy our analysis of their distinct approaches to divine proof. However, despite their earnest attempts, I contend that neither philosopher presents an entirely convincing case for God's existence.\n\nAnselm's methodology centers on introspective reasoning. His argument suggests that our ability to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence. By positing that we cannot truly imagine God's non-existence while holding the concept of God in our minds, Anselm develops what modern philosophers term an ontological argument. While his logic follows an intriguing path, it essentially boils down to finding divine truth through internal contemplation rather than external evidence. This approach aligns closely with the Christian notion of faith-based understanding.\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions empirical observation and logical deduction. His famous \"Five Ways\" present systematic arguments based on observable phenomena: motion, causation, necessity, gradation, and design. Each pathway constructs a logical framework necessitating God's existence, much like deducing the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece by examining the surrounding completed sections. This empirical approach particularly serves Christianity's evangelical mission, as it offers concrete reasoning rather than requiring a preliminary leap of faith. By grounding divine proof in observable reality, Aquinas provides tools for converting skeptics through rational discourse rather than spiritual conviction alone.",
            "Literary authors employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In analyzing \"The Great Gatsby,\" one discovers how its creator masterfully implements several such approaches. The text occasionally features unconventional pairings of descriptors with objects, creating unexpected imagery. Additionally, symbolic elements are carefully woven throughout the narrative to reinforce specific themes.\n\nAmong the most striking symbolic elements is the deliberate use of chromatic imagery. The narrative incorporates numerous hues - from aureate tones to emerald shades, from monochromatic whites and grays to various pink and crimson tints. This careful color orchestration serves to underscore deeper meanings throughout the work.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the application of the grayscale spectrum, ranging from pristine white to muted gray tones, which suggests conformity and social stratification. The brighter whites often denote affluence and sophistication, while grays typically represent aging or fading glory. This motif appears consistently throughout the narrative's opening sequences.\n\nCharacters frequently appear in ivory-colored attire - from the protagonist's acquaintances to party attendees. The only deviation occurs during the vivid party sequence, where primary colors dominate the scene. The author reinforces this color symbolism by applying it to mundane elements: metropolitan thoroughfares, guest registers, residential complexes - all described in various shades of white and gray.\n\nThis chromatic pattern extends to characterization, particularly regarding the female lead. Her appearances consistently feature these tones, from her clothing to her vehicle, gradually transforming her from a dynamic character into a symbol of societal conformity - merely another object of the protagonist's aspirations. This effect is reinforced through repeated references to pale and grayish tones in her descriptions, especially during pivotal scenes.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local producers cultivate an impressive array of crops, ranging from succulent tomatoes and vibrant citrus to fresh leafy vegetables, various squash varieties, and aromatic herbs. The region's fertile soil also supports fruit orchards, berry patches, apiaries, and pepper fields. Local residents demonstrate tremendous enthusiasm for community-supported organic agriculture, evidenced by extensive waitlists for farm memberships. The demand extends to organic dairy and poultry products, reflecting growing consumer consciousness.\n\nThese agricultural enterprises frequently combine food production with agritourism, welcoming visitors for educational tours and outdoor activities like hiking and wildlife observation. Such diversification allows proprietors to leverage governmental support while enhancing natural habitats and generating supplementary revenue streams through educational initiatives and recreational offerings.\n\nOrganic farming practices contribute significantly to environmental preservation by fostering diverse ecosystems. Nevertheless, this approach presents certain economic challenges. The absence of chemical interventions necessitates increased manual labor for pest control, weed management, and soil enrichment. Smaller organic operations often experience higher crop losses and reduced economies of scale compared to conventional farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, exotic species control, and habitat manipulation, further increase operational costs. These factors underscore the importance of accessing financial assistance and expert guidance to optimize both economic viability and ecological benefits.\n\nThe subject property encompasses 160 acres near Potrero, California, bordering Cleveland National Forest. This undeveloped parcel features chaparral vegetation, non-indigenous Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodlands. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecosystem, as defined by San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This initiative addresses numerous threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher, alongside potentially endangered species like burrowing owls.\n\nHistorical records indicate indigenous occupation spanning millennia, followed by nineteenth-century settlement by ranchers and wood merchants. The land's homestead patent origin suggests historical usage for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis examined current real estate listings and available government programs to evaluate viable options for small-scale agricultural operations emphasizing wildlife conservation, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "The relationship between siblings, particularly brothers, encompasses a complex web of emotions that creates an eternal connection. Such familial ties generate feelings ranging from affection and admiration to envy and hostility. No one comprehends a brother quite like another brother, as they serve as mirrors to each other's souls. Critical moments reveal the true essence of this connection, whether benevolent or malicious. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price. The fraternal bond demands not only understanding but also accepting the ramifications of actions driven by these powerful emotions. When siblings gaze upon one another, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than the facade presented to the world.\n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully illustrates this dynamic through its portrayal of two siblings navigating their relationship. Set against a richly detailed Southern backdrop, their story unfolds as an exercise in futility. The narrative culminates in a tragic scene where pride and disappointment collide, resulting in a devastating loss. The author conveys these themes through careful development of Doodle's character, the siblings' interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reveals his complicated emotional landscape and worldview.\n\nThe narrator's motivations stem primarily from an overwhelming sense of pride. His relationship with Doodle is tainted by disappointment from their earliest interactions. He had envisioned teaching a brother various physical activities, such as breath-holding contests, sprinting, and vine-climbing in Old Woman Swamp. His dreams included having a companion for races to Horsehead Landing and a partner for tree-climbing adventures in the towering pine behind their barn. These aspirations proved impossible due to Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival. The narrator's response to this reality manifested in disturbing ways, including contemplating infanticide by suffocation. Yet, Doodle's innocent smile penetrated this darkness, suggesting that beneath the narrator's resentment lay an innate, though complicated, brotherly affection.",
            "Our neural architecture represents an intricate system capable of processing vast amounts of data while demonstrating remarkable creativity. Throughout history, society's understanding of cognitive function has evolved alongside technological progress. Various analogies emerged - from ancient comparisons to wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, to more contemporary parallels with books and digital computers. Yet one must exercise caution, as these comparisons, while instructive, possess inherent limitations.\n\nThe cognitive process initiates when our sensory receptors convert physical phenomena - tactile sensations, thermal energy, acoustic waves, or light particles - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through dual-processing pathways. Consider observing a white canvas containing a dark square: elementary processing assembles basic elements like hue, directional alignment, and edge detection to construct the image. Simultaneously, higher-order processing expedites recognition by utilizing preliminary analytical results, helping distinguish between a solid object and negative space.\n\nCognitive filtration mechanisms evaluate incoming data streams, determining their significance and appropriate distribution across mental faculties. While your visual cortex processes countless grass blades within your field of view, selective attention typically suppresses individual blade recognition. Conversely, hearing your name across a crowded venue often triggers immediate recognition. This filtering process occurs continuously across multiple cognitive stages.\n\nData storage underlies all mental operations, manifesting in various forms including temporary sensory retention, active processing memory, and permanent storage. Initial data capture involves modality-specific encoding processes. For instance, verbal information storage encompasses physical appearance (structural), acoustic properties (phonemic), and conceptual significance (semantic). Research with various species indicates that short-term memory - lasting approximately twenty seconds - potentially relies on recurring electrical patterns within specific neural circuits. Long-term retention likely depends on protein structure modifications.\n\nMultiple theoretical frameworks attempt to explain knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent theory - the semantic network hypothesis - proposes interconnected concept nodes linked by relevance. Within this framework, conceptual relationships form naturally: \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" which links to \"wooden,\" creating an expansive associative network.",
            "The global financial landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2007 when a devastating economic crisis engulfed the United States. As businesses shuttered, homeowners faced foreclosure, and major institutions teetered on collapse, a complex web of factors emerged as the catalyst for this catastrophe. This economic turbulence continues to reverberate through our society, compelling us to examine its origins and preventive measures for the future. At its core, the crisis emerged from a perfect storm of misguided regulatory decisions, aggressive lending practices, and an inadequate financial framework that encouraged the proliferation of high-risk mortgages.\n\nThe seeds of economic instability were planted during the late 1990s, coinciding with presidential politics. In an effort to boost popularity, policymakers implemented more lenient lending guidelines, inadvertently setting the stage for future turmoil. Contemporary reporting by the New York Times' Steven Holmes highlighted mounting pressure on Fannie Mae to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes presciently warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nThe financial sector's increasing complexity contributed significantly to market instability. Novel financial instruments, including variable-rate mortgages and structured debt products, created intricate connections throughout the economy. This interconnectedness led to excessive exposure to real estate markets across multiple economic sectors, creating vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\nThe eventual collapse of the housing market triggered a devastating chain reaction throughout the financial system. Major investment banks reported staggering mortgage-related losses totaling $4.1 trillion in 2007, representing nearly one-third of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of Wall Street's most prestigious institutions. Government intervention became necessary for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which held $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, marking a pivotal moment in American financial history.",
            "Let's discuss the thorny issue of exposition in storytelling. While many writers view it as their chance to showcase literary prowess, it often becomes the point where reader engagement plummets. Even experienced authors like myself have caught themselves groaning at screens when confronted with information overload.\n\nExposition should never be your primary storytelling tool.\n\nWhile most writers understand the fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell,\" we frequently fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs or too much information is dumped at once. Think of exposition as that tempting voice suggesting you should front-load all the background information before getting to the interesting parts (though it's equally dangerous to succumb to the urge to detail every character's complete life story).\n\nIn essence, exposition delivers information directly to the reader. In movies, it manifests as those scenes where characters inexplicably narrate past events to each other. In written works, it's when authors directly feed information to readers.\n\nConsider this scenario: A narrative quickly summarizes how two characters met, married, and how one spouse died tragically - all within two pages and minimal dialogue. This approach does readers a disservice. Instead, the story should explore the husband's personality through his actions and words, demonstrating his devotion. It should illustrate how the relationship transformed both characters' lives. This deeper development allows readers to form emotional connections and better understand the surviving character's subsequent journey.\n\nThe difference lies between a bare-bones outline (\"They met, married, and parted\") and a fully realized narrative.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly list character traits like items on a grocery list. When introducing someone new - say, a former Air Force member now managing a gas station, twice divorced, weekend angler, aspiring business owner who enjoyed Eggs Benedict that morning - remember that character development requires more finesse than mere fact-dumping.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news broadcasts, specifically NBC 4's morning segment on August 13, 2011, several notable stories emerged. The broadcast opened with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended a suspect in connection with a multiple-stabbing case. The coverage was concise yet informative.\n\nSubsequently, they reported on an incident involving an 18-year-old victim of a shooting in the Sharon Woods district. The case, still under investigation by SWAT personnel, had no identified suspects at the time of reporting. The brevity of this coverage raised questions about potential media bias in crime reporting across different demographics.\n\nA particularly concerning story involved damage to emergency medical services equipment, specifically a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators determined the damage was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Local authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to an arrest.\n\nThe meteorological segment predicted precipitation and electrical storms for the upcoming Saturday, with temperature forecasts remaining moderate. This segment appeared deliberately abbreviated to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, where the suspect description received notably detailed attention. Additionally, they reported on a narcotics trafficking case involving an interstate operation between Texas and Ohio. The sentencing was unusually presented in months rather than years, potentially for dramatic effect.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, I observed particular patterns in how different stories received varying degrees of attention and detail, possibly reflecting underlying editorial biases.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent innovative financial instruments that mirror specific market segments, whether indices, commodities, or asset groups. These versatile securities combine the broad market exposure of traditional index funds with stock-like trading capabilities on major exchanges. Investors particularly value their ability to engage in margin trading, short selling, and fractional share purchases, while maintaining significantly reduced expense ratios compared to conventional mutual funds.\n\nDespite their numerous advantages, ETFs do present certain considerations, particularly the requirement to pay brokerage commissions on trades, similar to standard equity transactions. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully scrutinize claimed benefits, such as diversification effects, rather than accepting them at face value.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the healthcare-sector ETF IHF, comparing its characteristics against its principal components. We'll investigate whether holding the ETF provides comparable advantages to maintaining positions in its constituent stocks, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns or absolute performance.\n\nOur methodology concentrates on the fund's top ten positions, which collectively represent approximately 63.58% of total assets, as analyzing the complete holdings universe would prove impractical. These primary holdings and their respective allocations provide a representative sample for our investigation.\n\nTo assess how effectively these major components reflect IHF's overall profile, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the theoretical portfolio's beta coefficient and expected return. This approach enables direct comparison with the ETF's actual metrics.\n\nInitial findings reveal that a portfolio constructed solely from these primary holdings would have generated returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points (a 16% improvement) while maintaining a beta 0.12 lower than the fund itself. While these preliminary results suggest superior risk-adjusted performance from direct stock ownership, further statistical analysis becomes necessary to determine whether these differences are meaningful.\n\nTo establish statistical significance, we calculated normalized standard deviations for each component stock, enabling direct comparison with IHF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter participation during the project's third month. Several factors likely contributed to this unexpected downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our northeastern institution naturally discourages walking and cycling. Additionally, the academic calendar presents unique challenges, with December bringing final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties that compete for attention. The subsequent holiday break disperses our campus community, while the late January return to classes potentially explains that month's diminished participation rates. The February statistics, however, remain particularly puzzling.\n\nOne might reasonably attribute some decline to the natural enthusiasm curve of such initiatives, where initial excitement gradually wanes. Our team implemented a strategic response through the March Carpool Challenge Week, successfully boosting participation rates. This experience highlighted the necessity of maintaining momentum, particularly within the academic calendar's unique rhythm of intense activity and extended breaks.\n\nThe project faced an additional hurdle in America's deeply rooted car culture, which values personal autonomy and convenience. To counter this cultural preference, we implemented an incentive structure offering various rewards, including gift cards to regional establishments such as dining venues, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, the potential impact of more substantial prizes warrants consideration. The introduction of premium rewards - perhaps high-end bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - might have sustained engagement more effectively. A graduated prize structure, featuring increasingly valuable incentives throughout the project timeline, could have potentially reversed the observed participation decline. For instance, announcing the addition of bicycle prizes in December, followed by a hybrid vehicle reward in January, might have maintained or even enhanced participation levels rather than witnessing the documented decrease.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, specifically focusing on fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces employed clever editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unique variations across these productions, particularly noting how later examples began pushing traditional boundaries.\n\nThe majority of these early trick films followed specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a theater-like staging, maintained static camera positions, employed broader viewing angles, and typically contained just one continuous scene. Yet as the new century dawned, some bold filmmakers began experimenting with multiple scene transitions and other innovative techniques.\n\nA striking characteristic shared among these productions was their theatrical presentation style. Similar to stage performances of the era, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts, the camera remained fixed in a front-facing position, never following the performers' movements. This theatrical influence manifested clearly in the performers' movements, which typically occurred in lateral patterns rather than toward or away from the viewer. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame, never breaking the invisible fourth wall.\n\nThe staging approach naturally influenced shot composition, favoring wide and occasional medium-distance views while completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience, where audience members observed entire performances from a fixed vantage point. The actors maintained their position in the middle ground, preserving the stage-like atmosphere throughout the performance.\n\nMost productions adhered to a single-scene format, resulting in brief running times of approximately one minute. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, leading to an emphasis on short, entertaining tricks rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as one continuous shot often involved multiple takes cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) demonstrates this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate shots were combined to create the illusion of decapitation.",
            "Literary scholars often note that the Gothic Novel represents a fascinating paradox: a marriage between antiquity and modernity. This literary form, which emerged in the 18th century, has generated considerable debate regarding its merit and significance. Some dismiss it as superficial, while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nHorace Walpole's pioneering work, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" established the foundation for this genre by synthesizing elements from classical and contemporary storytelling traditions. His innovative approach incorporated theatrical devices from earlier periods while embracing the naturalistic tendencies of contemporary fiction. The term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations, referring variously to peoples, architectural styles, and historical epochs. During Walpole's time, many considered the gothic aesthetic outdated compared to the refined sensibilities of the Enlightenment era. However, the genre's unique combination of theatrical elements with novel-format psychological exploration has enabled its continued relevance across centuries.\n\nChivalric ideals feature prominently in Gothic literature, particularly in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" These medieval principles of knightly conduct undergo both preservation and transformation within the narrative. The emphasis on chivalry reflects a broader cultural nostalgia among Gothic authors, who often viewed their contemporary society as lacking the noble virtues of earlier ages. This perspective especially resonated with Walpole, who wrote during a period of political upheaval. His experiences in politics, marked by controversy and accusations, potentially influenced his portrayal of moral decay in contemporary society compared to an idealized medieval past.\n\nThis thematic concern manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. His characterization as a noble prince who endures hardship and faces presumed death at the hands of infidels exemplifies the genre's tendency toward dramatic amplification, establishing what would become a characteristic feature of Gothic literature.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and ultimate delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first articulated by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, represents a comprehensive approach to organizing, executing, and monitoring supply chain activities to maximize customer satisfaction through speed and efficiency. The framework consists of six fundamental components: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock management, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components strategically to deliver superior customer experiences.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes the framework for all subsequent activities, determining crucial aspects of production timing, rationale, location, and methodology. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the most reliable indicator of consumer demands. Upon completing market research and gaining clarity on customer needs, decision-makers can determine product specifications and quantities. Subsequently, they select optimal manufacturing facilities based on capacity and quality capabilities, while maintaining focus on meeting consumer expectations. The final manufacturing considerations involve work scheduling and equipment upkeep. The precision of manufacturing planning carries significant weight, as oversights can result in substantial financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail environments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nResource procurement, the second cornerstone, involves making strategic choices about core facility capabilities and external partnerships. Organizations often maintain multiple production divisions for single products, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division assignments for various production phases. Additionally, they may opt for external partnerships to enhance velocity - the capacity to deliver quality and adaptability while maintaining or reducing operational costs.",
            "The literary landscape of the Victorian era is widely recognized for its meticulous descriptive passages and its preoccupation with upper-class society. However, two notable exceptions to this pattern emerge in the form of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works distinguish themselves through their incorporation of mysterious elements and unconventional narratives, which serve to enhance character development and provide deeper understanding of their psychological states.\n\nConsider this passage from Oliver Twist: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth narratives employ dream sequences as a literary device, though each serves a distinct purpose. In Oliver Twist, these ethereal moments illuminate the protagonist's internal struggles and his growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's shooting scene, depicted through Oliver's semi-conscious state, exemplifies this technique. The dreamlike sequence emphasizes his powerlessness while highlighting his deteriorating physical condition, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting scene's sensory overload, coupled with Oliver's passive response to an \"unseen hand\" guiding him, underscores his lack of agency. This passivity raises questions about the forces shaping his destiny and suggests Fagin's growing influence over Oliver's spirit, manifesting in his inability to fight for self-preservation.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my experience as a tutor in an elementary after-school program, I encountered a fascinating case that highlighted an important educational challenge. While assisting students across various subjects, with particular expertise in literacy and language arts, I was assigned to work with a third-grade student named Adrian who exhibited unusual reading patterns.\n\nInitially, his reading difficulties seemed perplexing. Despite being a native English speaker of Hispanic heritage, Adrian demonstrated inconsistent letter recognition and pronunciation skills. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother during a day when most students were away on a field trip. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's primary exposure to written language had been through Spanish alphabet conventions.\n\nThis experience illuminates the complexities of language barriers in California's educational system, particularly how they manifest in unexpected ways. Even students who demonstrate verbal fluency in English may struggle with fundamental literacy skills due to their home language environment. While Adrian's case required focused instruction in English phonics and letter recognition, addressing broader language barriers in education demands a more comprehensive approach.\n\nResearch demonstrates that implementing dual-language programs benefits all students, not just English language learners. Studies indicate superior academic performance among children in two-way bilingual education compared to traditional monolingual instruction. While transitioning to such programs presents logistical challenges, particularly regarding staffing, practical solutions exist. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual, schools could employ specialized bilingual teaching assistants and support staff to facilitate this educational model.",
            "Throughout human history, cultures worldwide have grappled with the concept of higher powers and divine forces. Educational institutions, places of worship, and personal contemplation serve as vehicles for understanding these metaphysical questions. While many individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions without question, others staunchly reject supernatural beliefs, embracing a strictly materialistic worldview. The quest for spiritual understanding remains deeply personal, with individuals often exploring multiple belief systems throughout their lives. This universal journey reflects humanity's persistent search for meaning and enlightenment.\n\nDuring a peaceful afternoon on our veranda, I engaged in conversation with my father. The steady percussion of rainfall against the metal roofing provided a melancholic backdrop as we shared a moment of quiet companionship. Rivulets cascaded from the eaves, drenching the botanical arrangements below. When questioned about his preferred avian species, he mentioned the scarlet-plumed cardinal, his gaze distant and contemplative. His physical deterioration had become increasingly apparent - his attire hanging loosely, his once-full hair noticeably diminished. Words remained unspoken between us, both aware of impending loss but unable to articulate our emotions. Physical proximity offered comfort where language failed.\n\nHis departure occurred during the winter solstice, shortly after I celebrated my twenty-second year. Medical interventions prolonged his existence beyond initial prognoses, though their merit remained questionable given his extended suffering. This experience challenged my theological convictions; nocturnal solitude replaced evening prayers. Faith wavered in the face of seemingly senseless suffering.\n\nPersonal choice led me to absence during his final moments. The preservation of vibrant memories outweighed witnessing his departure. Understanding his character intimately, I recognized his preference to spare his offspring from such observations. Isolation became my refuge as I awaited inevitable news.\n\nCommunication networks failed during this critical juncture, leaving me in an information void.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideology, the agriculturalist and political figure John Taylor of Caroline stands prominent. His agricultural background, combined with his brief political endeavors, shaped him into a passionate advocate for individual liberties and governmental reform. Agricultural principles served as the foundation for his political philosophy, influencing his perspectives on everything from constitutional matters to judicial reform and state sovereignty.\n\nThe absence of entrenched traditions in America presented, according to Taylor, an unprecedented opportunity to establish genuine self-governance. He advocated for the interconnected nature of human rights, arguing that these fundamental liberties formed an inseparable network - compromise one, and the entire framework would deteriorate. Such rights, he maintained, must remain sacrosanct from governmental interference. While some spoke of humanity's natural state as favoring the physically strong and cunningly intelligent, Taylor envisioned civilization as requiring a different paradigm.\n\nTaylor's blueprint for an ideal society acknowledged humanity's moral complexity. His philosophical framework recognized both virtue and vice as inherent human qualities that must be considered in governmental design. He categorized beneficial principles as those supporting private ownership, agricultural advancement, and resistance to unchecked capitalism. Taylor theorized that proper governmental foundation could ensure equitable function despite leadership's inevitable self-interest. While he recognized self-interest as a universal motivator, he distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nAs a Constitutional literalist, Taylor advocated for severely restricted federal authority, limiting it strictly to explicitly granted powers. His concerns about federal overreach stemmed from fears of both financial burden and potential tyranny. Yet he cautioned against oversimplified Constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the founders' intent. Notably, he elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more explicit affirmation of state sovereignty over national unity.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, absorbing the scene before me with clinical detachment. Like a camera lens capturing raw data, my mind processed the visual input without attaching meaning or emotion. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness like leaves in a breeze, never settling long enough to take root.\n\nYears ago, I'd invested in an instructional text - \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" - following a colleague's recommendation. Since childhood, I'd harbored artistic aspirations, and this guide promised to unlock everything from basic techniques to cognitive processing. One particularly valuable lesson involved using a viewfinder to isolate subjects, transforming complex scenes into manageable compositions.\n\nBut in this moment, no artistic framework could contain what I witnessed. The sight commanded my complete attention, leaving me transfixed. Artists throughout history have been defined by their signature palettes - Picasso's blues, Monet's verdant landscapes, the vibrant spectrum of Renaissance masters. If I were to leave my mark on the artistic world, this scene before me would herald my defining period: studies in brown.\n\nWith surgical precision, I gripped my tool, executing the motion with deliberate control. The crystalline water spiraled elegantly, carrying away fragments of matter into the void. When the first attempt proved insufficient, I engaged the mechanism again, more urgently this time. Yet the stubborn mass remained anchored, mockingly immobile.\n\nThere I stood, standard-issue mop at the ready, corporate uniform complete with forest-green necktie, contemplating the unwelcome deposit some inconsiderate patron had left in the Rite Aid restroom. After several futile attempts at mechanical intervention, I resorted to manual measures, methodically wrapping my hand in protective layers of tissue. With the dignified resignation of someone performing an unpleasant but necessary duty, I approached the bowl like a surgeon preparing for a delicate procedure...",
            "Recent data reveals an alarming trend in vehicular fatalities among young drivers. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, indicates that neurological development plays a crucial role in driving capability. The combination of underdeveloped cognitive functions and limited driving experience creates a perfect storm of risk factors.\n\nStudies consistently demonstrate that novice drivers exhibit higher rates of dangerous driving behaviors, including excessive speed and loss of vehicle control. Moreover, peer influence significantly impacts driving outcomes. Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has established a direct link between passenger age demographics and collision frequency.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing programs to address these concerns, such measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem lies in the physiological and psychological readiness of young individuals to operate motor vehicles safely. Expert analysis, including research by behavioral scientist Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that risk-taking tendencies remain elevated until approximately age 20, as reported in USA Today.\n\nThe impending demographic surge of new drivers compounds this issue. As children of Baby Boomers reach driving age, the potential for increased accidents looms large. This demographic shift necessitates immediate policy intervention.\n\nA comprehensive solution would involve standardized national regulations establishing 18 as the minimum driving age. This framework could maintain current educational components while implementing stricter licensing requirements. The system would preserve supervised training requirements, such as those currently mandated in states like California, which requires 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven the consistency of accident statistics across state lines, federal oversight of driving age restrictions represents a logical approach to addressing this public safety concern. This proposed regulatory framework builds upon existing successful models while addressing current shortcomings in the system.",
            "An Investigation into Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) represents a fascinating intersection between neurology and auditory function. At its core, CAPD affects how individuals process auditory signals despite having normal hearing capabilities. The brain's interpretation mechanisms fail to properly decode incoming sound information, leading to various processing difficulties.\n\nThe condition's historical roots trace back to the 1950s, when scientists first identified what they termed \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking research emerged from Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who pioneered diagnostic methods. The field advanced significantly when Kimura developed dichotic testing protocols in 1961, establishing fundamental physiological models. By 1977, the disorder had garnered enough attention to warrant its first major scientific conference.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD experience diverse challenges. These may include difficulties with spatial sound orientation, sound pattern recognition, and the interpretation of vocal nuances. Some struggle to process sequential sounds or become overwhelmed when multiple acoustic events occur simultaneously. Unlike hearing impairment, CAPD specifically involves the brain's processing capabilities rather than the physical mechanisms of hearing.\n\nContemporary diagnostic approaches incorporate multiple assessment strategies. Healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists, employ various evaluation tools. These assessments might involve behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. While no singular diagnostic method currently exists, practitioners often utilize simultaneous auditory stimuli tests and measure acoustic signal responses to evaluate processing capabilities. The exact etiology remains unknown, necessitating ongoing research in this field.",
            "My aspiration to enter the field of social work stems from a deep-seated desire to make a meaningful impact through the Division of Family and Children Services, specifically focusing on protecting vulnerable children and supporting families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy interpersonal dynamics while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nMy journey toward this calling wasn't immediately clear. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with various challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping strategies. This observation led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. The pivotal moment came during a chance encounter that summer when I met a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse. The subsequent interaction with law enforcement and the teen's parents, who dismissed serious concerns as \"simple disputes,\" crystallized my purpose. Their dismissive attitude and apparent nervousness when confronted about their behavior reinforced my determination to advocate for vulnerable youth through social work.\n\nThe pursuit of social justice stands as another cornerstone of my professional aspirations. Contemporary society presents an interesting paradox - while we claim to value individuality, there's an underlying pressure to conform to predetermined norms. My personal response to this contradiction has been consistent advocacy for authentic self-expression and opposition to discriminatory practices. Throughout my academic career, I actively challenged societal constraints through various forms of self-expression and involvement in organizations like GSBA. My commitment to confronting discrimination and promoting equality remains unwavering, as I believe these elements are fundamental to creating meaningful social change.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through two distinct frameworks: the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives. While biological analysis centers on genetic inheritance and medical conditions, sociocultural examination delves into environmental factors, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic influences. This analysis explores these perspectives through various research studies, evaluating their relative merits and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders fall into several classifications. They may manifest as primary conditions, emerge alongside other mental health issues, or develop due to external factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass two main categories: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias include six distinct conditions, with Primary Insomnia - characterized by persistent sleep difficulties lasting at least one month - being the most common. In contrast, Parasomnias involve unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep, such as nightmares, night terrors, or sleepwalking.\n\nRecent neurological research has revealed fascinating insights into sleep regulation. Scientists have discovered that specific neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, play a crucial role in maintaining sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with rodents have identified GABAB receptors on these neurons as key regulators of sleep states. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, they observed increased sleep promotion. Furthermore, the administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, resulted in extended sleep duration. These findings suggest potential genetic predispositions to sleep disorders and highlight how inherited receptor variations might influence an individual's sleep patterns, potentially impacting their daily functioning, academic performance, and professional life.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating our expansive campus. The issue of transportation became particularly evident during my initial year when I resided in East Halls. The journey from my accommodation in Stuart Hall to centrally located facilities like Willard Building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nThe campus landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent years. According to alumni accounts, East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast undeveloped areas. Today, these spaces have been transformed into athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, and residential complexes. This continuous expansion has intensified the transportation challenges faced by students.\n\nIn addressing these mobility concerns, bicycles emerge as the optimal solution for campus transportation. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after an extended break. Their enthusiasm was evident: \"I can't believe I ever stopped cycling. Despite its fluctuating popularity, it's truly the most practical transportation method.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling represents remarkable efficiency in transportation. The energy from a simple breakfast can power a cyclist for dozens of miles.\n\nAs an off-campus resident situated at a distance comparable to some university housing, I've found my bicycle investment invaluable. My daily commute to Thomas Building, which would normally require 25 minutes by foot, takes merely 5 minutes by bicycle at a brisk pace. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my academic schedule demands greater efficiency. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 150 minutes weekly when considering various campus commitments - proves essential for maintaining a balanced academic schedule.",
            "In his seminal work Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a dystopian society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes individualism, and the pursuit of instant gratification becomes the primary driving force of human existence. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere pieces in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA close analysis through Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about societal development and economic systems. The text employs various concepts central to Marxist thought, such as class uniformity and objectification, suggesting that Huxley sought to critique the emerging economic paradigms of his era.\n\nThe novel's treatment of social conditioning mirrors the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - exemplify this through their programmed behavior, achieved through sleep-learning techniques that instill consumerist values. This systematic manipulation, orchestrated by the ruling class, demonstrates social dominance theory in action. The privileged classes, while potentially aware of this system, largely maintain their complicity, with few exceptions like Bernard questioning the established order.\n\nThe absence of meaningful interpersonal connections throughout the narrative serves as a powerful metaphor. Characters lack psychological complexity, suggesting that technological progress and consumer culture have stripped humanity of its essential nature. Emotional depth is replaced by superficial interactions, evidenced by the purely physical nature of relationships between men and women. Each social stratum's acceptance of their predetermined role reflects the economic impact of consumer capitalism, where individuals are pacified through false promises of fulfillment through consumption and conformity.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that delved into Islamic studies. A recurring theme throughout the semester centered on the perception of Islam in modern society. This discussion has only gained significance in contemporary times. The media's portrayal of Islam has undergone a remarkable transformation since the tragic events of September 2001, shifting from overt skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation. The political landscape has similarly evolved, as evidenced by the unprecedented acceptance of candidates with Islamic heritage.\n\nUpon examining the traditional biographical accounts of Muhammad, I encountered what appeared to be significant discrepancies between historical records and religious narratives. Historical documentation suggests a military leader who expanded his influence through conquest, yet religious texts paint a portrait of a humble spiritual guide whose followers came to him voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nThe biographical accounts contain numerous parallels to Christian scripture, particularly in the description of supernatural events. One notable example describes the multiplication of food, reminiscent of similar Biblical narratives. These parallels raise questions about the authenticity and potential motivations behind such accounts, particularly in their apparent attempt to establish religious legitimacy through familiar miraculous motifs.\n\nThe methodology of documentation in these biographical accounts relies heavily on chains of oral transmission, with stories passed through multiple intermediaries before being recorded. While this system was intended to establish credibility, it potentially introduces questions about the reliability of such accounts, as information may have been altered through multiple retellings.\n\nThe disparity between historical evidence and religious narrative regarding Muhammad's character and methods presents a challenging dichotomy. The peaceful, humble figure portrayed in religious texts seems at odds with historical accounts of military campaigns and territorial expansion, raising questions about historical accuracy versus religious interpretation.",
            "In examining the trajectory of Christian theology, one observes a significant divergence between the original teachings of Christ and subsequent doctrinal developments. This historical evolution demonstrates how religious institutions often drift from their foundational principles. Contemporary society exhibits an increasing intellectual curiosity and progressive mindset, though conservative elements persist in maintaining traditional interpretations. These traditionalists, while vocal, may lack the numerical strength to prevent inevitable change.\n\nThe coming decades will likely witness an unprecedented surge in historical consciousness among Christian adherents. This awakening will spark a widespread desire to differentiate between later theological additions and Christ's original message. Though this transformation may span generations, its culmination appears certain: Christianity will experience a fundamental realignment with its roots.\n\nThis theological reformation will systematically deconstruct accumulated doctrine, essentially reversing centuries of theological evolution. The end result may be a stripped-down faith, focused purely on Jesus's divine message, unencumbered by subsequent interpretations. As this movement gains momentum across Western nations, encouraging worship patterns reminiscent of first-century practices, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their relevance while guiding this transformation. Paradoxically, this retrograde movement will likely reduce the current denominational fragmentation, fostering greater uniformity in belief and practice.\n\nHistorical precedents for such dramatic reversals exist: consider Rome's transformation from persecutor to promoter of Christianity, or America's evolution from slavery to racial inclusion in leadership. This impending religious reformation will be facilitated by adopting metaphorical rather than literal interpretations of Jesus's teachings.\n\nExamining Christianity's origins reveals its emergence from Judaism, which by 63 BCE had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority under Roman occupation. The Jewish community of this period was notably diverse, encompassing various sects including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through a careful analysis of The Jungle, one can observe a compelling portrayal of humanity's inherent tendency toward self-interest and avarice. The narrative expertly illustrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of power, consistently prioritize personal gain over collective welfare. This dynamic manifests most prominently in the industrial leadership's behavior.\n\nThe factory proprietors and administrators demonstrate an unwavering focus on expansion and profit maximization, displaying minimal concern for collateral damage. As Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery effectively conveys the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization. The administration's indifference extends to both environmental degradation and sanitation issues, including the widespread contamination from livestock facilities throughout Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation of human capital represents another facet of this systemic dysfunction. As the text states, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The absence of labor protection legislation during this period enabled widespread worker exploitation, including arbitrary terminations and hazardous working conditions.\n\nThe residents of Packingtown endured these deplorable circumstances without recourse to protective agencies or advocacy organizations. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than protected their members. The text draws a powerful parallel between these workers and chattel slavery: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Literary scholars have long debated the influences behind Edgar Allan Poe's haunting poem \"Dream-Land.\" The work, which incorporates the mysterious term \"Thulé,\" demonstrates fascinating connections to both classical and contemporary sources. While some academics point to Virgil's use of the term - referring to a mythical northern island beyond Britain - a compelling argument exists for more recent inspirations.\n\nThe German literary tradition, particularly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's masterwork \"Faust,\" offers intriguing parallels. Within \"Faust Part Two\" (1832), we find \"The King of Thulé,\" a melancholic ballad about a grieving monarch who, after his queen's death, receives a golden goblet as her final gift. The narrative concludes with the king's dramatic suicide after disposing of this precious memento in the ocean's depths.\n\nThe thematic resonance between Goethe's ballad and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is striking. Both works explore realms of profound loss, isolation, and psychological torment. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" traverses a colorless landscape populated by spectral memories, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's bereaved king. Poe's repeated use of \"Thulé\" - appearing at both the beginning and end of the poem - creates a symbolic framework that echoes the German master's exploration of mortality and despair.\n\nGoethe's influence on nineteenth-century literature was considerable, and Poe's awareness of his work seems certain. Not only was Goethe highly regarded by Alfred Tennyson, whom Poe deeply respected, but numerous English adaptations of his works circulated in American literary circles. H.P. Grattan's 1842 dramatic adaptation of \"Faust\" preceded Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by mere months, suggesting a direct line of influence.",
            "Examining Punitive Damages in California Premises Liability: Analysis of Customer Injury Due to Management Negligence\n\nThis analysis explores whether punitive damages could be justified in a slip-and-fall incident where store management demonstrated potential negligence. The case involves D&D Markets, where customer Jennifer Palmer sustained serious injuries after falling on an unremediated applesauce spill.\n\nThe incident timeline reveals concerning management behavior. At approximately 5:00 PM, employee Rich Wayne reported the hazard to manager Paul Martin. Fifteen minutes later, staff member Mary J. Haddigan reiterated this safety concern. In both instances, Martin dismissed the warnings, citing his dinner break as precedence. The plaintiff's injury occurred at 5:30 PM, marking a 30-minute window of inaction. Notably, D&D Markets had documented five similar incidents within the same calendar year.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 3294(a) establishes that punitive damages may be awarded upon demonstration of \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute further clarifies that malicious conduct encompasses actions showing \"willful and conscious disregard\" for others' safety. Precedent established in Taylor v. Superior Court emphasizes that awareness of probable dangers, coupled with deliberate failure to address them, constitutes malicious conduct.\n\nGiven these parameters, the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages warrants consideration. The manager's repeated dismissal of safety warnings, particularly in light of the establishment's history of similar incidents, suggests conscious disregard for customer safety. While proving \"despicable\" conduct presents a higher hurdle, the pattern of negligence and prioritization of personal convenience over customer safety provides substantial grounds for the claim to proceed.\n\nBased on these factors, summary dismissal of the punitive damages claim would be inappropriate, as sufficient evidence exists to support the plaintiff's position.",
            "The emptiness first manifested during her early adolescence. At fourteen, an inexplicable void took residence in her heart, persisting well into her seventeenth year. Time revealed that this yearning wasn't for an object but for companionship, though not in any conventional sense. Despite numerous admirers and awkward courtships, no male suitor sparked her interest. This peculiarity prompted considerable self-reflection, yet years of introspection yielded no satisfactory explanation for her apparent immunity to teenage romance.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere in which she grew up was remarkably serene. Her parents exemplified harmony, rarely engaging in disputes. The only source of tension arose from their daughter's fierce independence, which contrasted sharply with their placid nature. Her vibrant personality and genuine kindness made her universally appealing, creating an interesting dynamic within their peaceful household.\n\nThe tranquility shattered one afternoon when an agonized cry echoed from the kitchen. Racing toward the sound, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, clearly in distress. Between labored breaths, her mother managed to request immediate medical attention. Drawing upon her strength training, she carefully lifted her injured parent and transported her to their vehicle, laying her across the back seat before heading to the emergency room.\n\nThe hospital's sterile environment barely registered as she rushed through the entrance, calling urgently for medical assistance. Healthcare professionals quickly surrounded them, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination. Left alone in the waiting area, anxiety consumed her thoughts as she recalled the simple accident that precipitated this crisis - her mother's unfortunate fall from a stepstool while reaching for a decorative vase in their highest cabinet.",
            "Recent research investigated the correlation between cardiovascular health outcomes and compliance with Mediterranean-style eating patterns, as quantified by the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) scoring system. The traditional Mediterranean dietary approach emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes while incorporating healthy fats from sources like fish and nuts. This eating pattern limits animal products and saturated fats but permits reasonable alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated promising connections between Mediterranean eating patterns and improved cardiovascular outcomes, including reduced mortality rates. Additionally, clinical trials have shown advantages over conventional low-fat diets regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles among overweight participants. However, the specific impact on stroke risk remained relatively unexplored.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals aged 38-63 years, all participants in the broader Nurses' Health Study encompassing 121,700 women across 11 states. None had pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or diabetes. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers evaluated dietary habits through periodic food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), maintaining an impressive 95% participant retention rate. The study team verified reported cardiovascular events through medical documentation, though approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks were classified as \"probable\" cases due to limited record availability.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of aMed scores across multiple questionnaires. The analysis incorporated various health and lifestyle factors, including exercise habits, smoking status, and hormone therapy use. Statistical evaluation employed Cox proportional-hazard models to examine relationships between dietary patterns and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective effects associated with stronger Mediterranean diet adherence. Over two decades of observation, researchers documented 2,391 coronary events, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths. Participants with the highest aMed scores demonstrated a 29% lower risk of both coronary events and strokes compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A lone figure emerges on an urban corner - actress Ellen Page (known for her role in Juno) holding aloft a makeshift cardboard sign. Its message is jarring: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has languished under military dictatorship since a 1962 governmental overthrow. The nation witnessed unprecedented civil unrest in 2007 when Buddhist monastics initiated what became known as the \"Saffron Revolution\" - named for their distinctive orange-hued garments. As public participation swelled, initial government tolerance gave way to systematic violence against religious institutions nationwide. International media faced severe restrictions; notably, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai lost his life documenting these events on September 27th. While official statistics cite merely 13 casualties, military defector Colonel Hla Win revealed a far grimmer reality: \"The actual death count reaches thousands.\"\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine mandate for absolute power. Japanese imperial mythology elevated rulers to divine status. Even modern governance shows concerning parallels, as evidenced by certain political-religious alliances in contemporary America.\n\nHistorical precedents abound: China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 saw casualties ranging from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000. The 1994 Rwandan crisis witnessed government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany's regime represents perhaps the most infamous example of systematic state-sponsored persecution.",
            "The remarkable impact of Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his extended career and exceptional talent for orchestral innovation. While his piano work often maintains a reserved presence in many compositions, his true genius manifested in creating intricate musical arrangements that capitalized on his musicians' unique strengths. The framework he developed allowed for both spontaneous improvisation and meticulously arranged sections, carefully designed to showcase the distinctive styles of individual performers.\n\nThe orchestral landscape he painted demonstrated an extraordinary understanding of collective sound dynamics. His ability to weave together individual talents into a cohesive ensemble resulted in groundbreaking jazz compositions that continue to influence musicians today.\n\nAccording to Grove Music's scholarly analysis, compositions like \"Creole Love Call\" exemplify his revolutionary approach to incorporating vocals as an instrumental element. This piece, structured as a twelve-bar blues with six distinct choruses, demonstrates his masterful arrangement techniques:\n\nThe initial chorus presents an interplay between vocals and reed instruments, transitioning from smooth to textured tones.\nFollowing this, a muted trumpet emerges with elaborate blue note expressions.\nThe third section features an ethereal clarinet solo, accompanied by delicate piano rhythms.\nA full orchestral interpretation of the opening theme appears in the fourth chorus.\nThe piece reaches its apex in the fifth chorus with high-register reed sections leading the call-and-response.\nThe final chorus mirrors the opening structure but incorporates instrumental-style vocal techniques.\nThe composition concludes with a brief coda featuring vocal flourishes and unconventional trombone elements.\n\nThis innovative approach to vocal integration appears consistently throughout his repertoire. In \"Hot and Bothered\" (1928), Ellington masterfully combines Miley's trumpet work with Cox's vocal scatting, creating an unprecedented tonal fusion. This experimental approach continued in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Nanton's trombone work introduces the memorable melody with distinctive muted effects.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary trajectories in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the mechanisms that guide evolutionary modifications. Despite significant advances since D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 observation regarding the lack of mathematical descriptions for biological forms, contemporary researchers still grapple with similar challenges. Recent developments have incorporated mathematical frameworks to analyze mollusk shell development across both individual growth and evolutionary timescales, as demonstrated by researchers like Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur research investigates Prunum species, integrating mathematical modeling with empirical studies to understand developmental and evolutionary patterns. Through X-ray imaging, we identified measurable characteristics that enabled us to model both theoretical and actual shell configurations using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By generating theoretical morphologies, we established potential morphological boundaries within Prunum. These computational results, combined with laboratory observations, enhance our comprehension of major evolutionary transitions in this group.\n\nGastropod shells exhibit a fascinating architectural pattern: a tubular structure that coils through space in 360-degree rotations. These rotational segments, termed whorls, encircle a central columella. The growth rate between whorls varies, with visible suture lines marking whorl boundaries. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically represents the largest section, while preceding whorls constitute the spire. The shell structure extends from the apex (uppermost point) to the base, featuring an aperture through which the organism emerges.\n\nShell morphology can be examined from multiple perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard scientific illustration presents shells in apertural view, displaying the opening while oriented apex-upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a standardized protocol. Beginning with an apical perspective, researchers identify the initial suture point and establish a reference line. Whorl counts proceed from this marker, measured to quarter-whorl precision.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a temporal sequence of apertures, tracking the organism's shell secretion process. This growth pattern can be mapped using aperture center coordinates and dimensional measurements, enabling both visual and mathematical representation. Such mathematical frameworks facilitate the exploration of various developmental scenarios through parameter modification.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's statistics regarding newborn and infant deaths have shown minimal change. Despite making progress on various Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation sectors, improvements in both child and maternal wellness fall significantly behind the benchmarks established for 2015. Several factors contribute to these deficiencies, suggesting that a comprehensive healthcare reform might prove more beneficial than isolated program-based solutions.\n\nAlthough Indonesia now reports that 72% of childbirths involve qualified healthcare personnel, this figure warrants closer examination. The classification encompasses traditional birthing assistants, including local midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications such as severe bleeding during delivery. Thus, while the statistics appear promising, they mask underlying inadequacies in the system. Furthermore, recent trends show fewer children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrheal conditions, and available information suggests inadequate post-birth care nationwide.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% overall. More troubling is the stark urban-rural divide, with cities reporting 7% cesarean deliveries compared to just 2% in rural regions. This disparity highlights a broader issue of healthcare accessibility, which heavily favors urban populations. Economic inequality further compounds this problem, with a 27-percentage-point difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely due to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant care metrics, policymakers face a crucial decision between targeted interventions and broad healthcare system improvements. While specialized programs offer clear objectives and quick wins, they come with significant drawbacks. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health services and attract healthcare workers away from general practice. Moreover, multiple parallel initiatives frequently result in redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, as evidenced by the impact of HIV/AIDS funding on family planning resources.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing numerous genres that defy simple categorization. Each primary genre - whether it's rap, rock, country, jazz, or folk - has branched into countless subgenres, creating an intricate musical tapestry. Among these, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly fascinating, having evolved into one of popular music's most complex and emotionally charged genres since its emergence four decades ago.\n\nHeavy Metal's emotional palette, while predominantly exploring darker themes, demonstrates remarkable range and depth. The genre's adaptability became evident shortly after its inception, as musicians began experimenting with its foundations, spawning successive waves of subgenres. This continuous evolution persists to this day, creating an ever-expanding musical universe.\n\nContemporary Heavy Metal presents such diversity that defining its core characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has absorbed influences from various musical traditions, understanding its origins remains crucial. To truly grasp modern metal's significance, one must examine it not merely as a genre but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAt its essence, Heavy Metal embodies intensity and excess - in volume, instrumental proficiency, theatrical presentation, and emotional expression. Unlike some genres, metal demands technical mastery; its practitioners consistently demonstrate exceptional musicianship. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic revolution of the 1970s, when drug experimentation led to groundbreaking sonic innovations. Metal distinguished itself by embracing darker themes at a time when mainstream music generally avoided such territory. Modern metal continues to draw inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic Era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles - often cited as an early metal prototype. Created as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcased the band's ability to venture into darker territory, featuring themes of destabilization commonly associated with drug experiences. Its inclusion on The White Album marked a significant moment in metal's prehistory.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, preceding the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously creating visual narratives that transcended conventional artistic boundaries. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, exemplifies both the literal representation of a woman experiencing an enchanted vision and symbolizes Rousseau's personal aspirations within the artistic community. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau grappled with a fundamental challenge: whether to embrace established artistic conventions to gain acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nUnderstanding this artistic tension requires examination of Rousseau's background. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, he emerged from a middle-class environment, with his father operating a successful hardware business. Notably, Rousseau's artistic journey deviated from traditional paths, as he lacked formal training and spent his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly, with the loss of eight children in infancy and his first wife, Clémence, leaving him to raise his surviving daughter Julia alone. Art became his sanctuary and means of emotional restoration.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries who idealized rural life in their works, Rousseau maintained an authentic folk-art perspective, reflecting the genuine aspirations and experiences of his social class. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of prominent modern artists like Matisse. According to art historian Jan Gordon's \"Modern French Painters,\" while Matisse actively sought to challenge artistic conventions, Rousseau paradoxically strived for acceptance through conformity to established artistic standards, hoping to gain membership in the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers and scholars have observed striking parallels between moral principles and artistic expression, suggesting these domains share fundamental connections. This relationship becomes apparent when examining how humans process both ethical decisions and aesthetic experiences. While traditional learning occurs through structured education or direct experience, our understanding of morality and beauty seems to emerge from a deeper, more intuitive source.\n\nWhen analyzing either ethical principles or artistic merit, we typically focus on describing existing phenomena rather than establishing rigid guidelines. Critics and philosophers attempt to explain why certain actions feel morally correct or why particular artworks resonate with viewers, instead of creating strict rulebooks for moral behavior or artistic creation.\n\nInterestingly, neither artistic criticism nor ethical analysis can fully capture the essence of their subjects. Consider discussions about masterpieces like the Mona Lisa – while experts may analyze technical elements such as composition and historical significance, these aspects alone cannot explain its enduring impact. Similarly, when people discuss their favorite artistic works, they often preface detailed analysis with intuitive responses, suggesting an ineffable quality beyond technical description.\n\nThis transcendent aspect appears in both artistic appreciation and moral understanding. Literary works, in particular, demonstrate this connection most clearly. Unlike other art forms, literature inherently incorporates moral dimensions, as it reflects human experiences and value systems. The written word serves as a unique bridge between aesthetic beauty and ethical contemplation, allowing us to explore complex moral territories through artistic expression.\n\nThe profound connection between ethics and aesthetics stems from their shared appeal to our intuitive understanding. Both domains affect us at a level beyond rational explanation, operating in what philosophers might call the realm of pure experience. This special characteristic, this indefinable quality, creates a natural bond between moral truth and artistic beauty, particularly evident in literary works where human values and artistic expression seamlessly intertwine.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a unified nation, its distinctive cultural fabric woven seamlessly from Munich's alpine foothills to the northern ports of Kiel on the Baltic coast. This cultural tapestry extends from Cologne's Rhine-side boulevards through the heartland to Dresden's baroque splendor along the Elbe. The rich mosaic of contemporary German identity reflects its diverse origins, emerging from numerous historical tribes and principalities.\n\nThe ancestral homeland, historically termed Germania, carries a name whose origins spark scholarly debate. Historical records indicate various potential etymologies. According to Roman accounts, particularly those of Tacitus, the term derived from a tribe called the Tungri, who had previously been known as \"Germans\" before their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\" introduced \"Germanus\" into Roman literature, adopting Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples beyond the Rhine. Linguistic scholars propose alternative origins, suggesting connections to ancient weaponry terminology (the \"ger\" spear) or Celtic linguistic roots meaning \"neighbor\" or \"shouter.\"\n\nTacitus's ethnographic work \"Germania\" (98 CE) presents a fascinating perspective on these peoples, describing them as indigenous to their territories and relatively unmixed with other populations. He emphasizes the region's forbidding nature, questioning why anyone would choose such harsh terrain over Mediterranean comforts unless it were their native land.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania developed primarily through commerce and military recruitment rather than settlement. While Roman expeditions ventured into Germanic territories for resources and campaigns, permanent Roman settlement remained limited. Germanic tribes, establishing themselves during the first century CE, maintained a complex relationship with the Empire, engaging in trade and military service while preserving their independence along Roman frontiers.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores the complex relationship between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The resolution of such pretense often forces an uncomfortable choice: maintaining personal integrity versus preserving social bonds. When deceptions unravel, reactions vary dramatically – some shrug it off, while others experience deep betrayal.\n\nThe gender-bending elements of the narrative raise particularly intriguing questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine attire emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy inadvertently severs potential female friendships and creates romantic complications.\n\nThese complications manifest most notably in Olivia's misplaced affections – \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138) – and in Orsino's conflicted emotions: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261). Contemporary audiences might interpret these entanglements as Shakespeare's commentary on fluid sexuality and hidden desires. However, Olivia's swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a different reading: rather than exploring latent same-sex attraction, Shakespeare appears to satirize superficial attraction based purely on appearance.\n\nThis interpretation gains credence through Olivia's eventual acceptance of Viola as family rather than lover: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). The resolution demonstrates how deception, while temporarily useful for unveiling suppressed emotions, must ultimately yield to authentic relationships based on truth.",
            "Historical accounts frequently highlight the harsh nature of German colonial administration, particularly regarding the tragic events involving the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, painting an entire colonial empire with a single brush would be an oversimplification. The reality reveals a tapestry of administrative approaches across different territories, including varying educational strategies.\n\nWhen examining educational outcomes, fascinating contrasts emerge. Following their 1919 acquisition of German East Africa (Tanganyika), British administrators encountered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun by writers of the period. However, the educational landscape in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) tells a markedly different story.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational initiatives seen in East Africa, South West African indigenous education relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal governmental assistance. Interestingly, the administration allocated substantial resources toward European education in the territory, establishing government schools and providing enhanced support for missionary institutions serving white settlers. These educational disparities created lasting implications. While other former German territories produced numerous educated indigenous individuals, South West Africa's native population remained largely unexposed to formal education. Multiple factors contributed to this unique situation, warranting further investigation into settler attitudes and administrative policies.\n\nScholarly literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, predominantly consisting of German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused primarily on describing educational frameworks, while subsequent English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. Cohen's research comparing South West African and East African education systems stands out, suggesting that South West Africa's substantial settler population significantly influenced its educational development.\n\nThe territory's relatively moderate climate, despite its predominantly desert landscape, attracted a significant European presence. By 1913, South West Africa hosted nearly 15,000 European settlers, almost triple the white population of East Africa, the next most populated German colony.",
            "During the mid-19th century, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that lasted nearly six decades, from 1836 until 1893. This period of strained relations reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in America's acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Conflicts persisted between these neighboring nations until shortly before World War I, stemming from fundamental differences in faith, societal values, and economic interests.\n\nBorder conflicts frequently characterize relationships between adjacent countries, and the Mexican-American dynamic proves no exception. Historical records indicate that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba maintained prolonged diplomatic tensions with the United States, largely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in this historical antagonism. Just as 20th-century Americans opposed totalitarian ideologies, their 18th and 19th-century predecessors harbored strong anti-Catholic sentiments. This religious divide mirrors other historical conflicts, such as the ideological component of U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War. The seeds of this religious antipathy trace back to Anglo-Spanish rivalries, which both nations inherited from their respective colonial powers.\n\nHistorical documentation reveals 17 distinct confrontations between these nations during their 57-year period of rivalry. Most incidents involved cross-border violence and frontier-related disputes. Both countries eventually deployed military forces along their shared border to address persistent bandit activity targeting frontier settlements.\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic ties with the United States. By the century's end, American interests had shifted from territorial expansion to commercial investment in Mexico, fundamentally altering the relationship between these neighboring nations.",
            "In 2008, my life transformed dramatically when a rare medical condition struck without warning. At the time, I was working in healthcare, having chosen the field primarily for its promise of job security - a decision driven by my unstable childhood. Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I followed the conventional wisdom that medical professions would always be in demand.\n\nThe irony wasn't lost on me when, at age 46, I found myself unable to work, single, and financially vulnerable. Now, after more than a decade receiving disability benefits, I've watched my personal assets dwindle to practically nothing. Each day presents new challenges to my dignity and sense of security. However, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. When crisis strikes, even the strongest among us need helping hands.\n\nLife's uncertainties - whether minor inconveniences or major catastrophes - will always exist. No amount of preparation can fully insulate us from needing assistance when truly significant challenges arise.\n\nWhile I support reducing dependence on government institutions (which have certainly shown their limitations), I believe the solution lies in strengthening community bonds rather than retreating into individual fortresses. The narrative of America being built on \"rugged individualism\" overlooks a crucial historical fact: our ancestors survived through cooperation and resource-sharing. Consider the westward expansion - those wagon trains succeeded through collective effort, not isolation.\n\nI'm certainly an advocate for emergency preparedness. My own home contains disaster supplies: medical kits, water treatment supplies, protective materials, emergency lighting, and shelf-stable food. For those with the means, maintaining a small farm or installing alternative heating sources makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever, the most valuable preparation might be simply reaching out to those living nearby. Community resilience often proves more sustainable than individual readiness.",
            "The origins of Buddhism can be traced to approximately 500 BCE, when an individual later known as the Buddha emerged from princely origins. His journey toward enlightenment and subsequent teachings established what would evolve into various Buddhist traditions, with Theravada emerging as the most traditional branch. As with any ancient faith spanning millennia, modern Buddhist practice has undergone significant transformations. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual performed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony absent from original Buddhist teachings, yet embraced by both religious officials and ordinary practitioners alike. Such evolutionary changes extend beyond mere customs to influence fundamental religious principles. The Buddhist faith community has adapted its core teachings in response to various influences, both from within and without, some supportive and others challenging.\n\nTo properly analyze these changes, we must establish clear definitions. When examining influences, we distinguish between those originating from within the Buddhist community (internal) and those from non-Buddhist sources (external). Additionally, we categorize these forces as either antagonistic - seeking to undermine Buddhist practice - or neutral, which may inadvertently impact the faith despite having no explicit agenda regarding Buddhism.\n\nUnderstanding contemporary Theravada Buddhism requires familiarity with its foundational elements. Central to the faith is devotion to three primary aspects: the enlightened teacher, his message, and the monastic community. Buddhist scripture is organized into three collections: discourses, monastic regulations, and philosophical teachings. Key philosophical concepts include the absence of a permanent self, life's inherent challenges, and universal impermanence. Recognition of these principles is considered essential for breaking free from the continuous cycle of existence, thereby eliminating negative qualities such as craving, animosity, and misconception. The religious code prescribes different levels of commitment - lay practitioners follow five basic moral guidelines, while monastics adhere to more extensive regulations. The framework of Buddhism rests upon four fundamental realities: life contains suffering, attachment breeds suffering, liberation from suffering is possible, and there exists a path toward such liberation."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about.

While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In any negotiation process, cultural dynamics emerge as a crucial factor. The concept of culture defies simple categorization; it's a complex tapestry that cannot be reduced to stereotypes or broad generalizations. Rather than making sweeping assumptions like \"Europeans are direct\" or \"Asians are indirect,\" successful negotiators recognize the nuanced impact of cultural influences on business discussions. When individuals encounter different cultural frameworks, they inevitably filter these experiences through their own cultural lens, creating a natural comparative analysis.\n\nSuccessfully navigating cultural differences requires deep engagement, from exploring historical contexts to understanding inherent biases. Instead of critiquing or attempting to modify cultural norms, effective negotiators adapt their approach to work within established cultural parameters. This becomes particularly critical when operating from a position of lesser leverage or when conducting negotiations in unfamiliar territory. Demonstrating cultural sensitivity and respecting local customs often serves as a bridge across cultural divides.\n\nCultural distinctions extend beyond national boundaries into organizational spheres. Each business entity typically develops its distinctive organizational ethos. This manifests in various ways: work-life balance expectations, communication protocols, attire requirements, and charitable engagement policies. Even within a single nation, corporate cultures can vary dramatically between organizations, and sometimes between different locations of the same company. While some societies might present a more unified exterior, careful observation often reveals subtle but significant internal variations.\n\nUnderstanding core values provides insight into cultural motivations. In societies where maintaining harmony or preserving dignity is paramount, negotiators typically avoid actions that could cause public embarrassment. Conversely, representatives from achievement-oriented cultures might focus more on securing optimal terms than swift resolution. While these cultural patterns provide valuable context, successful negotiators also invest time in understanding their counterparts' individual perspectives and motivations.",
            "In both Psalm 14 and the philosophical works of Anselm and Aquinas, we encounter the dismissal of atheistic thought. When comparing these two medieval theologians' perspectives on proving God's existence, we must operate within their shared theological framework - specifically, the Christian conception of deity. Any broader interpretation would muddy our analysis of their distinct approaches to divine proof. However, despite their earnest attempts, I contend that neither philosopher presents an entirely convincing case for God's existence.\n\nAnselm's methodology centers on introspective reasoning. His argument suggests that our ability to conceptualize God inherently proves divine existence. By positing that we cannot truly imagine God's non-existence while holding the concept of God in our minds, Anselm develops what modern philosophers term an ontological argument. While his logic follows an intriguing path, it essentially boils down to finding divine truth through internal contemplation rather than external evidence. This approach aligns closely with the Christian notion of faith-based understanding.\n\nConversely, Aquinas champions empirical observation and logical deduction. His famous \"Five Ways\" present systematic arguments based on observable phenomena: motion, causation, necessity, gradation, and design. Each pathway constructs a logical framework necessitating God's existence, much like deducing the characteristics of a missing puzzle piece by examining the surrounding completed sections. This empirical approach particularly serves Christianity's evangelical mission, as it offers concrete reasoning rather than requiring a preliminary leap of faith. By grounding divine proof in observable reality, Aquinas provides tools for converting skeptics through rational discourse rather than spiritual conviction alone.",
            "Literary authors employ various techniques to evoke specific emotional responses from their audience regarding crucial themes. The effectiveness of these methods varies considerably. In analyzing \"The Great Gatsby,\" one discovers how its creator masterfully implements several such approaches. The text occasionally features unconventional pairings of descriptors with objects, creating unexpected imagery. Additionally, symbolic elements are carefully woven throughout the narrative to reinforce specific themes.\n\nAmong the most striking symbolic elements is the deliberate use of chromatic imagery. The narrative incorporates numerous hues - from aureate tones to emerald shades, from monochromatic whites and grays to various pink and crimson tints. This careful color orchestration serves to underscore deeper meanings throughout the work.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the application of the grayscale spectrum, ranging from pristine white to muted gray tones, which suggests conformity and social stratification. The brighter whites often denote affluence and sophistication, while grays typically represent aging or fading glory. This motif appears consistently throughout the narrative's opening sequences.\n\nCharacters frequently appear in ivory-colored attire - from the protagonist's acquaintances to party attendees. The only deviation occurs during the vivid party sequence, where primary colors dominate the scene. The author reinforces this color symbolism by applying it to mundane elements: metropolitan thoroughfares, guest registers, residential complexes - all described in various shades of white and gray.\n\nThis chromatic pattern extends to characterization, particularly regarding the female lead. Her appearances consistently feature these tones, from her clothing to her vehicle, gradually transforming her from a dynamic character into a symbol of societal conformity - merely another object of the protagonist's aspirations. This effect is reinforced through repeated references to pale and grayish tones in her descriptions, especially during pivotal scenes.",
            "The agricultural landscape of San Diego County flourishes under perpetual sunshine and temperate weather conditions. Local producers cultivate an impressive array of crops, ranging from succulent tomatoes and vibrant citrus to fresh leafy vegetables, various squash varieties, and aromatic herbs. The region's fertile soil also supports fruit orchards, berry patches, apiaries, and pepper fields. Local residents demonstrate tremendous enthusiasm for community-supported organic agriculture, evidenced by extensive waitlists for farm memberships. The demand extends to organic dairy and poultry products, reflecting growing consumer consciousness.\n\nThese agricultural enterprises frequently combine food production with agritourism, welcoming visitors for educational tours and outdoor activities like hiking and wildlife observation. Such diversification allows proprietors to leverage governmental support while enhancing natural habitats and generating supplementary revenue streams through educational initiatives and recreational offerings.\n\nOrganic farming practices contribute significantly to environmental preservation by fostering diverse ecosystems. Nevertheless, this approach presents certain economic challenges. The absence of chemical interventions necessitates increased manual labor for pest control, weed management, and soil enrichment. Smaller organic operations often experience higher crop losses and reduced economies of scale compared to conventional farms. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, exotic species control, and habitat manipulation, further increase operational costs. These factors underscore the importance of accessing financial assistance and expert guidance to optimize both economic viability and ecological benefits.\n\nThe subject property encompasses 160 acres near Potrero, California, bordering Cleveland National Forest. This undeveloped parcel features chaparral vegetation, non-indigenous Mediterranean grasses, and oak woodlands. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecosystem, as defined by San Diego's Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This initiative addresses numerous threatened species, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterflies, and the California gnatcatcher, alongside potentially endangered species like burrowing owls.\n\nHistorical records indicate indigenous occupation spanning millennia, followed by nineteenth-century settlement by ranchers and wood merchants. The land's homestead patent origin suggests historical usage for livestock grazing and timber harvesting. This analysis examined current real estate listings and available government programs to evaluate viable options for small-scale agricultural operations emphasizing wildlife conservation, using an existing organic farm in the vicinity as a reference model.",
            "The relationship between siblings, particularly brothers, encompasses a complex web of emotions that creates an eternal connection. Such familial ties generate feelings ranging from affection and admiration to envy and hostility. No one comprehends a brother quite like another brother, as they serve as mirrors to each other's souls. Critical moments reveal the true essence of this connection, whether benevolent or malicious. These emotional revelations often come at a significant price. The fraternal bond demands not only understanding but also accepting the ramifications of actions driven by these powerful emotions. When siblings gaze upon one another, they glimpse their authentic selves rather than the facade presented to the world.\n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully illustrates this dynamic through its portrayal of two siblings navigating their relationship. Set against a richly detailed Southern backdrop, their story unfolds as an exercise in futility. The narrative culminates in a tragic scene where pride and disappointment collide, resulting in a devastating loss. The author conveys these themes through careful development of Doodle's character, the siblings' interactions, and the narrator's perspective, which reveals his complicated emotional landscape and worldview.\n\nThe narrator's motivations stem primarily from an overwhelming sense of pride. His relationship with Doodle is tainted by disappointment from their earliest interactions. He had envisioned teaching a brother various physical activities, such as breath-holding contests, sprinting, and vine-climbing in Old Woman Swamp. His dreams included having a companion for races to Horsehead Landing and a partner for tree-climbing adventures in the towering pine behind their barn. These aspirations proved impossible due to Doodle's severe cardiac condition, which initially threatened his very survival. The narrator's response to this reality manifested in disturbing ways, including contemplating infanticide by suffocation. Yet, Doodle's innocent smile penetrated this darkness, suggesting that beneath the narrator's resentment lay an innate, though complicated, brotherly affection.",
            "Our neural architecture represents an intricate system capable of processing vast amounts of data while demonstrating remarkable creativity. Throughout history, society's understanding of cognitive function has evolved alongside technological progress. Various analogies emerged - from ancient comparisons to wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, to more contemporary parallels with books and digital computers. Yet one must exercise caution, as these comparisons, while instructive, possess inherent limitations.\n\nThe cognitive process initiates when our sensory receptors convert physical phenomena - tactile sensations, thermal energy, acoustic waves, or light particles - into neural signals. These signals undergo multiple transformations through dual-processing pathways. Consider observing a white canvas containing a dark square: elementary processing assembles basic elements like hue, directional alignment, and edge detection to construct the image. Simultaneously, higher-order processing expedites recognition by utilizing preliminary analytical results, helping distinguish between a solid object and negative space.\n\nCognitive filtration mechanisms evaluate incoming data streams, determining their significance and appropriate distribution across mental faculties. While your visual cortex processes countless grass blades within your field of view, selective attention typically suppresses individual blade recognition. Conversely, hearing your name across a crowded venue often triggers immediate recognition. This filtering process occurs continuously across multiple cognitive stages.\n\nData storage underlies all mental operations, manifesting in various forms including temporary sensory retention, active processing memory, and permanent storage. Initial data capture involves modality-specific encoding processes. For instance, verbal information storage encompasses physical appearance (structural), acoustic properties (phonemic), and conceptual significance (semantic). Research with various species indicates that short-term memory - lasting approximately twenty seconds - potentially relies on recurring electrical patterns within specific neural circuits. Long-term retention likely depends on protein structure modifications.\n\nMultiple theoretical frameworks attempt to explain knowledge organization within neural networks. These models draw from cognitive psychology, computer science, and neurological research. One prominent theory - the semantic network hypothesis - proposes interconnected concept nodes linked by relevance. Within this framework, conceptual relationships form naturally: \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" which links to \"wooden,\" creating an expansive associative network.",
            "The global financial landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2007 when a devastating economic crisis engulfed the United States. As businesses shuttered, homeowners faced foreclosure, and major institutions teetered on collapse, a complex web of factors emerged as the catalyst for this catastrophe. This economic turbulence continues to reverberate through our society, compelling us to examine its origins and preventive measures for the future. At its core, the crisis emerged from a perfect storm of misguided regulatory decisions, aggressive lending practices, and an inadequate financial framework that encouraged the proliferation of high-risk mortgages.\n\nThe seeds of economic instability were planted during the late 1990s, coinciding with presidential politics. In an effort to boost popularity, policymakers implemented more lenient lending guidelines, inadvertently setting the stage for future turmoil. Contemporary reporting by the New York Times' Steven Holmes highlighted mounting pressure on Fannie Mae to increase mortgage accessibility while maintaining profit growth. Holmes presciently warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nThe financial sector's increasing complexity contributed significantly to market instability. Novel financial instruments, including variable-rate mortgages and structured debt products, created intricate connections throughout the economy. This interconnectedness led to excessive exposure to real estate markets across multiple economic sectors, creating vulnerability to market fluctuations.\n\nThe eventual collapse of the housing market triggered a devastating chain reaction throughout the financial system. Major investment banks reported staggering mortgage-related losses totaling $4.1 trillion in 2007, representing nearly one-third of the nation's GDP. The aftermath saw the dissolution or forced transformation of Wall Street's most prestigious institutions. Government intervention became necessary for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which held $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, marking a pivotal moment in American financial history.",
            "Let's discuss the thorny issue of exposition in storytelling. While many writers view it as their chance to showcase literary prowess, it often becomes the point where reader engagement plummets. Even experienced authors like myself have caught themselves groaning at screens when confronted with information overload.\n\nExposition should never be your primary storytelling tool.\n\nWhile most writers understand the fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell,\" we frequently fall into the trap of writing lengthy passages where either nothing significant occurs or too much information is dumped at once. Think of exposition as that tempting voice suggesting you should front-load all the background information before getting to the interesting parts (though it's equally dangerous to succumb to the urge to detail every character's complete life story).\n\nIn essence, exposition delivers information directly to the reader. In movies, it manifests as those scenes where characters inexplicably narrate past events to each other. In written works, it's when authors directly feed information to readers.\n\nConsider this scenario: A narrative quickly summarizes how two characters met, married, and how one spouse died tragically - all within two pages and minimal dialogue. This approach does readers a disservice. Instead, the story should explore the husband's personality through his actions and words, demonstrating his devotion. It should illustrate how the relationship transformed both characters' lives. This deeper development allows readers to form emotional connections and better understand the surviving character's subsequent journey.\n\nThe difference lies between a bare-bones outline (\"They met, married, and parted\") and a fully realized narrative.\n\nWriters must resist the urge to rapidly list character traits like items on a grocery list. When introducing someone new - say, a former Air Force member now managing a gas station, twice divorced, weekend angler, aspiring business owner who enjoyed Eggs Benedict that morning - remember that character development requires more finesse than mere fact-dumping.",
            "During my analysis of Columbus, Ohio news broadcasts, specifically NBC 4's morning segment on August 13, 2011, several notable stories emerged. The broadcast opened with coverage of a domestic violence incident in Ashley, where authorities had apprehended a suspect in connection with a multiple-stabbing case. The coverage was concise yet informative.\n\nSubsequently, they reported on an incident involving an 18-year-old victim of a shooting in the Sharon Woods district. The case, still under investigation by SWAT personnel, had no identified suspects at the time of reporting. The brevity of this coverage raised questions about potential media bias in crime reporting across different demographics.\n\nA particularly concerning story involved damage to emergency medical services equipment, specifically a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators determined the damage was caused by a .22 caliber rifle round. Local authorities announced a substantial monetary incentive for information leading to an arrest.\n\nThe meteorological segment predicted precipitation and electrical storms for the upcoming Saturday, with temperature forecasts remaining moderate. This segment appeared deliberately abbreviated to maintain viewer engagement.\n\nThe broadcast also covered a convenience store robbery on Clime Road, where the suspect description received notably detailed attention. Additionally, they reported on a narcotics trafficking case involving an interstate operation between Texas and Ohio. The sentencing was unusually presented in months rather than years, potentially for dramatic effect.\n\nThroughout the broadcast, I observed particular patterns in how different stories received varying degrees of attention and detail, possibly reflecting underlying editorial biases.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent innovative financial instruments that mirror specific market segments, whether indices, commodities, or asset groups. These versatile securities combine the broad market exposure of traditional index funds with stock-like trading capabilities on major exchanges. Investors particularly value their ability to engage in margin trading, short selling, and fractional share purchases, while maintaining significantly reduced expense ratios compared to conventional mutual funds.\n\nDespite their numerous advantages, ETFs do present certain considerations, particularly the requirement to pay brokerage commissions on trades, similar to standard equity transactions. The marketplace offers an extensive selection of ETF options, though prudent investors should carefully scrutinize claimed benefits, such as diversification effects, rather than accepting them at face value.\n\nThis analysis focuses on the healthcare-sector ETF IHF, comparing its characteristics against its principal components. We'll investigate whether holding the ETF provides comparable advantages to maintaining positions in its constituent stocks, while also exploring potential alternative weightings that might enhance risk-adjusted returns or absolute performance.\n\nOur methodology concentrates on the fund's top ten positions, which collectively represent approximately 63.58% of total assets, as analyzing the complete holdings universe would prove impractical. These primary holdings and their respective allocations provide a representative sample for our investigation.\n\nTo assess how effectively these major components reflect IHF's overall profile, we normalized their weightings to 100% and calculated the theoretical portfolio's beta coefficient and expected return. This approach enables direct comparison with the ETF's actual metrics.\n\nInitial findings reveal that a portfolio constructed solely from these primary holdings would have generated returns exceeding the ETF by 6.11 percentage points (a 16% improvement) while maintaining a beta 0.12 lower than the fund itself. While these preliminary results suggest superior risk-adjusted performance from direct stock ownership, further statistical analysis becomes necessary to determine whether these differences are meaningful.\n\nTo establish statistical significance, we calculated normalized standard deviations for each component stock, enabling direct comparison with IHF's overall volatility characteristics.",
            "Analysis of Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter participation during the project's third month. Several factors likely contributed to this unexpected downturn. The seasonal impact of winter weather at our northeastern institution naturally discourages walking and cycling. Additionally, the academic calendar presents unique challenges, with December bringing final examinations, grading periods, and administrative duties that compete for attention. The subsequent holiday break disperses our campus community, while the late January return to classes potentially explains that month's diminished participation rates. The February statistics, however, remain particularly puzzling.\n\nOne might reasonably attribute some decline to the natural enthusiasm curve of such initiatives, where initial excitement gradually wanes. Our team implemented a strategic response through the March Carpool Challenge Week, successfully boosting participation rates. This experience highlighted the necessity of maintaining momentum, particularly within the academic calendar's unique rhythm of intense activity and extended breaks.\n\nThe project faced an additional hurdle in America's deeply rooted car culture, which values personal autonomy and convenience. To counter this cultural preference, we implemented an incentive structure offering various rewards, including gift cards to regional establishments such as dining venues, wellness services, and retail outlets. In retrospect, the potential impact of more substantial prizes warrants consideration. The introduction of premium rewards - perhaps high-end bicycles or eco-friendly vehicles - might have sustained engagement more effectively. A graduated prize structure, featuring increasingly valuable incentives throughout the project timeline, could have potentially reversed the observed participation decline. For instance, announcing the addition of bicycle prizes in December, followed by a hybrid vehicle reward in January, might have maintained or even enhanced participation levels rather than witnessing the documented decrease.",
            "During my research at the Library of Congress, I examined their collection of early Edison trick films, specifically focusing on fifteen works produced between 1895 and 1901. These fascinating pieces employed clever editing techniques to create magical effects. My analysis revealed both common patterns and unique variations across these productions, particularly noting how later examples began pushing traditional boundaries.\n\nThe majority of these early trick films followed specific conventions: they were filmed indoors, utilized a theater-like staging, maintained static camera positions, employed broader viewing angles, and typically contained just one continuous scene. Yet as the new century dawned, some bold filmmakers began experimenting with multiple scene transitions and other innovative techniques.\n\nA striking characteristic shared among these productions was their theatrical presentation style. Similar to stage performances of the era, particularly magic shows and vaudeville acts, the camera remained fixed in a front-facing position, never following the performers' movements. This theatrical influence manifested clearly in the performers' movements, which typically occurred in lateral patterns rather than toward or away from the viewer. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame, never breaking the invisible fourth wall.\n\nThe staging approach naturally influenced shot composition, favoring wide and occasional medium-distance views while completely avoiding close-ups. This mirrored the theatrical experience, where audience members observed entire performances from a fixed vantage point. The actors maintained their position in the middle ground, preserving the stage-like atmosphere throughout the performance.\n\nMost productions adhered to a single-scene format, resulting in brief running times of approximately one minute. This format naturally limited storytelling possibilities, leading to an emphasis on short, entertaining tricks rather than complex narratives. However, it's worth noting that what appeared as one continuous shot often involved multiple takes cleverly spliced together. \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) demonstrates this technique - while appearing seamless to viewers, careful observation reveals the precise moment where separate shots were combined to create the illusion of decapitation.",
            "Literary scholars often note that the Gothic Novel represents a fascinating paradox: a marriage between antiquity and modernity. This literary form, which emerged in the 18th century, has generated considerable debate regarding its merit and significance. Some dismiss it as superficial, while others celebrate its capacity to evoke what Edmund Burke termed the 'terrible sublime.'\n\nHorace Walpole's pioneering work, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" established the foundation for this genre by synthesizing elements from classical and contemporary storytelling traditions. His innovative approach incorporated theatrical devices from earlier periods while embracing the naturalistic tendencies of contemporary fiction. The term \"gothic\" itself carried multiple connotations, referring variously to peoples, architectural styles, and historical epochs. During Walpole's time, many considered the gothic aesthetic outdated compared to the refined sensibilities of the Enlightenment era. However, the genre's unique combination of theatrical elements with novel-format psychological exploration has enabled its continued relevance across centuries.\n\nChivalric ideals feature prominently in Gothic literature, particularly in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" These medieval principles of knightly conduct undergo both preservation and transformation within the narrative. The emphasis on chivalry reflects a broader cultural nostalgia among Gothic authors, who often viewed their contemporary society as lacking the noble virtues of earlier ages. This perspective especially resonated with Walpole, who wrote during a period of political upheaval. His experiences in politics, marked by controversy and accusations, potentially influenced his portrayal of moral decay in contemporary society compared to an idealized medieval past.\n\nThis thematic concern manifests clearly in characters like Frederic, whose portrayal incorporates numerous traditional chivalric elements. His characterization as a noble prince who endures hardship and faces presumed death at the hands of infidels exemplifies the genre's tendency toward dramatic amplification, establishing what would become a characteristic feature of Gothic literature.",
            "The orchestration of goods movement, from initial customer requests through raw material procurement, manufacturing, and ultimate delivery, encompasses what we know as supply chain management. This concept, first articulated by consultant Keith Oliver in 1982, represents a comprehensive approach to organizing, executing, and monitoring supply chain activities to maximize customer satisfaction through speed and efficiency. The framework consists of six fundamental components: manufacturing operations, resource procurement, stock management, facility positioning, logistics, and data flow. Business leaders leverage these components strategically to deliver superior customer experiences.\n\nManufacturing serves as the cornerstone of supply chain operations. This initial phase establishes the framework for all subsequent activities, determining crucial aspects of production timing, rationale, location, and methodology. Leadership must maintain a keen understanding of consumer preferences, primarily through market analysis, which serves as the most reliable indicator of consumer demands. Upon completing market research and gaining clarity on customer needs, decision-makers can determine product specifications and quantities. Subsequently, they select optimal manufacturing facilities based on capacity and quality capabilities, while maintaining focus on meeting consumer expectations. The final manufacturing considerations involve work scheduling and equipment upkeep. The precision of manufacturing planning carries significant weight, as oversights can result in substantial financial and temporal losses. Drawing from personal experience in major retail environments like Wal-Mart and Target, I've observed how standardized protocols - from dress codes to receiving procedures - contribute to operational efficiency.\n\nResource procurement, the second cornerstone, involves making strategic choices about core facility capabilities and external partnerships. Organizations often maintain multiple production divisions for single products, each equipped with distinct machinery, personnel, and expertise. Leadership must optimize division assignments for various production phases. Additionally, they may opt for external partnerships to enhance velocity - the capacity to deliver quality and adaptability while maintaining or reducing operational costs.",
            "The literary landscape of the Victorian era is widely recognized for its meticulous descriptive passages and its preoccupation with upper-class society. However, two notable exceptions to this pattern emerge in the form of Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works distinguish themselves through their incorporation of mysterious elements and unconventional narratives, which serve to enhance character development and provide deeper understanding of their psychological states.\n\nConsider this passage from Oliver Twist: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.\" (Dickens, 220)\n\nBoth narratives employ dream sequences as a literary device, though each serves a distinct purpose. In Oliver Twist, these ethereal moments illuminate the protagonist's internal struggles and his growing awareness of his circumstances. Chapter 28's shooting scene, depicted through Oliver's semi-conscious state, exemplifies this technique. The dreamlike sequence emphasizes his powerlessness while highlighting his deteriorating physical condition, evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting scene's sensory overload, coupled with Oliver's passive response to an \"unseen hand\" guiding him, underscores his lack of agency. This passivity raises questions about the forces shaping his destiny and suggests Fagin's growing influence over Oliver's spirit, manifesting in his inability to fight for self-preservation.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it's dreadful silence and short in it's fleeting ours.\"",
            "During my experience as a tutor in an elementary after-school program, I encountered a fascinating case that highlighted an important educational challenge. While assisting students across various subjects, with particular expertise in literacy and language arts, I was assigned to work with a third-grade student named Adrian who exhibited unusual reading patterns.\n\nInitially, his reading difficulties seemed perplexing. Despite being a native English speaker of Hispanic heritage, Adrian demonstrated inconsistent letter recognition and pronunciation skills. The breakthrough in understanding his situation came unexpectedly when I met his Spanish-speaking mother during a day when most students were away on a field trip. Despite my limited Spanish proficiency, our interaction revealed the root cause: Adrian's primary exposure to written language had been through Spanish alphabet conventions.\n\nThis experience illuminates the complexities of language barriers in California's educational system, particularly how they manifest in unexpected ways. Even students who demonstrate verbal fluency in English may struggle with fundamental literacy skills due to their home language environment. While Adrian's case required focused instruction in English phonics and letter recognition, addressing broader language barriers in education demands a more comprehensive approach.\n\nResearch demonstrates that implementing dual-language programs benefits all students, not just English language learners. Studies indicate superior academic performance among children in two-way bilingual education compared to traditional monolingual instruction. While transitioning to such programs presents logistical challenges, particularly regarding staffing, practical solutions exist. Rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual, schools could employ specialized bilingual teaching assistants and support staff to facilitate this educational model.",
            "Throughout human history, cultures worldwide have grappled with the concept of higher powers and divine forces. Educational institutions, places of worship, and personal contemplation serve as vehicles for understanding these metaphysical questions. While many individuals embrace their inherited religious traditions without question, others staunchly reject supernatural beliefs, embracing a strictly materialistic worldview. The quest for spiritual understanding remains deeply personal, with individuals often exploring multiple belief systems throughout their lives. This universal journey reflects humanity's persistent search for meaning and enlightenment.\n\nDuring a peaceful afternoon on our veranda, I engaged in conversation with my father. The steady percussion of rainfall against the metal roofing provided a melancholic backdrop as we shared a moment of quiet companionship. Rivulets cascaded from the eaves, drenching the botanical arrangements below. When questioned about his preferred avian species, he mentioned the scarlet-plumed cardinal, his gaze distant and contemplative. His physical deterioration had become increasingly apparent - his attire hanging loosely, his once-full hair noticeably diminished. Words remained unspoken between us, both aware of impending loss but unable to articulate our emotions. Physical proximity offered comfort where language failed.\n\nHis departure occurred during the winter solstice, shortly after I celebrated my twenty-second year. Medical interventions prolonged his existence beyond initial prognoses, though their merit remained questionable given his extended suffering. This experience challenged my theological convictions; nocturnal solitude replaced evening prayers. Faith wavered in the face of seemingly senseless suffering.\n\nPersonal choice led me to absence during his final moments. The preservation of vibrant memories outweighed witnessing his departure. Understanding his character intimately, I recognized his preference to spare his offspring from such observations. Isolation became my refuge as I awaited inevitable news.\n\nCommunication networks failed during this critical juncture, leaving me in an information void.",
            "Among the early champions of Republican ideology, the agriculturalist and political figure John Taylor of Caroline stands prominent. His agricultural background, combined with his brief political endeavors, shaped him into a passionate advocate for individual liberties and governmental reform. Agricultural principles served as the foundation for his political philosophy, influencing his perspectives on everything from constitutional matters to judicial reform and state sovereignty.\n\nThe absence of entrenched traditions in America presented, according to Taylor, an unprecedented opportunity to establish genuine self-governance. He advocated for the interconnected nature of human rights, arguing that these fundamental liberties formed an inseparable network - compromise one, and the entire framework would deteriorate. Such rights, he maintained, must remain sacrosanct from governmental interference. While some spoke of humanity's natural state as favoring the physically strong and cunningly intelligent, Taylor envisioned civilization as requiring a different paradigm.\n\nTaylor's blueprint for an ideal society acknowledged humanity's moral complexity. His philosophical framework recognized both virtue and vice as inherent human qualities that must be considered in governmental design. He categorized beneficial principles as those supporting private ownership, agricultural advancement, and resistance to unchecked capitalism. Taylor theorized that proper governmental foundation could ensure equitable function despite leadership's inevitable self-interest. While he recognized self-interest as a universal motivator, he distinguished between its constructive manifestation in society-building and its destructive expression in exploitative factions.\n\nAs a Constitutional literalist, Taylor advocated for severely restricted federal authority, limiting it strictly to explicitly granted powers. His concerns about federal overreach stemmed from fears of both financial burden and potential tyranny. Yet he cautioned against oversimplified Constitutional interpretation, emphasizing the importance of understanding the founders' intent. Notably, he elevated the Declaration of Independence above the Constitution, viewing it as a more explicit affirmation of state sovereignty over national unity.",
            "My gaze fixed downward, absorbing the scene before me with clinical detachment. Like a camera lens capturing raw data, my mind processed the visual input without attaching meaning or emotion. Thoughts flickered through my consciousness like leaves in a breeze, never settling long enough to take root.\n\nYears ago, I'd invested in an instructional text - \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" - following a colleague's recommendation. Since childhood, I'd harbored artistic aspirations, and this guide promised to unlock everything from basic techniques to cognitive processing. One particularly valuable lesson involved using a viewfinder to isolate subjects, transforming complex scenes into manageable compositions.\n\nBut in this moment, no artistic framework could contain what I witnessed. The sight commanded my complete attention, leaving me transfixed. Artists throughout history have been defined by their signature palettes - Picasso's blues, Monet's verdant landscapes, the vibrant spectrum of Renaissance masters. If I were to leave my mark on the artistic world, this scene before me would herald my defining period: studies in brown.\n\nWith surgical precision, I gripped my tool, executing the motion with deliberate control. The crystalline water spiraled elegantly, carrying away fragments of matter into the void. When the first attempt proved insufficient, I engaged the mechanism again, more urgently this time. Yet the stubborn mass remained anchored, mockingly immobile.\n\nThere I stood, standard-issue mop at the ready, corporate uniform complete with forest-green necktie, contemplating the unwelcome deposit some inconsiderate patron had left in the Rite Aid restroom. After several futile attempts at mechanical intervention, I resorted to manual measures, methodically wrapping my hand in protective layers of tissue. With the dignified resignation of someone performing an unpleasant but necessary duty, I approached the bowl like a surgeon preparing for a delicate procedure...",
            "Recent data reveals an alarming trend in vehicular fatalities among young drivers. Research from multiple institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, indicates that neurological development plays a crucial role in driving capability. The combination of underdeveloped cognitive functions and limited driving experience creates a perfect storm of risk factors.\n\nStudies consistently demonstrate that novice drivers exhibit higher rates of dangerous driving behaviors, including excessive speed and loss of vehicle control. Moreover, peer influence significantly impacts driving outcomes. Research conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center has established a direct link between passenger age demographics and collision frequency.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions have implemented graduated licensing programs to address these concerns, such measures merely scratch the surface of a deeper issue. The fundamental problem lies in the physiological and psychological readiness of young individuals to operate motor vehicles safely. Expert analysis, including research by behavioral scientist Dr. Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that risk-taking tendencies remain elevated until approximately age 20, as reported in USA Today.\n\nThe impending demographic surge of new drivers compounds this issue. As children of Baby Boomers reach driving age, the potential for increased accidents looms large. This demographic shift necessitates immediate policy intervention.\n\nA comprehensive solution would involve standardized national regulations establishing 18 as the minimum driving age. This framework could maintain current educational components while implementing stricter licensing requirements. The system would preserve supervised training requirements, such as those currently mandated in states like California, which requires 6 hours of professional instruction and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven the consistency of accident statistics across state lines, federal oversight of driving age restrictions represents a logical approach to addressing this public safety concern. This proposed regulatory framework builds upon existing successful models while addressing current shortcomings in the system.",
            "An Investigation into Central Auditory Processing Disorder: Definition, Diagnosis, and Educational Support\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) represents a fascinating intersection between neurology and auditory function. At its core, CAPD affects how individuals process auditory signals despite having normal hearing capabilities. The brain's interpretation mechanisms fail to properly decode incoming sound information, leading to various processing difficulties.\n\nThe condition's historical roots trace back to the 1950s, when scientists first identified what they termed \"auditory imperception.\" Groundbreaking research emerged from Italian scientists Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who pioneered diagnostic methods. The field advanced significantly when Kimura developed dichotic testing protocols in 1961, establishing fundamental physiological models. By 1977, the disorder had garnered enough attention to warrant its first major scientific conference.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD experience diverse challenges. These may include difficulties with spatial sound orientation, sound pattern recognition, and the interpretation of vocal nuances. Some struggle to process sequential sounds or become overwhelmed when multiple acoustic events occur simultaneously. Unlike hearing impairment, CAPD specifically involves the brain's processing capabilities rather than the physical mechanisms of hearing.\n\nContemporary diagnostic approaches incorporate multiple assessment strategies. Healthcare professionals, including audiologists and speech-language pathologists, employ various evaluation tools. These assessments might involve behavioral observations, questionnaires, and specialized auditory tests. While no singular diagnostic method currently exists, practitioners often utilize simultaneous auditory stimuli tests and measure acoustic signal responses to evaluate processing capabilities. The exact etiology remains unknown, necessitating ongoing research in this field.",
            "My aspiration to enter the field of social work stems from a deep-seated desire to make a meaningful impact through the Division of Family and Children Services, specifically focusing on protecting vulnerable children and supporting families in crisis. The fundamental principles that align with my professional goals encompass dedication to service, dignity for all individuals, unwavering ethical standards, and a commitment to fostering healthy interpersonal dynamics while maintaining professional excellence. These principles resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nMy journey toward this calling wasn't immediately clear. During my academic years, I observed numerous peers struggling with various challenges, often resorting to maladaptive coping strategies. This observation led me to pursue Psychology at Piedmont College, graduating in 2009. The pivotal moment came during a chance encounter that summer when I met a distressed teenager seeking refuge from domestic abuse. The subsequent interaction with law enforcement and the teen's parents, who dismissed serious concerns as \"simple disputes,\" crystallized my purpose. Their dismissive attitude and apparent nervousness when confronted about their behavior reinforced my determination to advocate for vulnerable youth through social work.\n\nThe pursuit of social justice stands as another cornerstone of my professional aspirations. Contemporary society presents an interesting paradox - while we claim to value individuality, there's an underlying pressure to conform to predetermined norms. My personal response to this contradiction has been consistent advocacy for authentic self-expression and opposition to discriminatory practices. Throughout my academic career, I actively challenged societal constraints through various forms of self-expression and involvement in organizations like GSBA. My commitment to confronting discrimination and promoting equality remains unwavering, as I believe these elements are fundamental to creating meaningful social change.",
            "Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, can be examined through two distinct frameworks: the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives. While biological analysis centers on genetic inheritance and medical conditions, sociocultural examination delves into environmental factors, including racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic influences. This analysis explores these perspectives through various research studies, evaluating their relative merits and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders fall into several classifications. They may manifest as primary conditions, emerge alongside other mental health issues, or develop due to external factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass two main categories: Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias include six distinct conditions, with Primary Insomnia - characterized by persistent sleep difficulties lasting at least one month - being the most common. In contrast, Parasomnias involve unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep, such as nightmares, night terrors, or sleepwalking.\n\nRecent neurological research has revealed fascinating insights into sleep regulation. Scientists have discovered that specific neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, play a crucial role in maintaining sleep-wake cycles. Laboratory studies with rodents have identified GABAB receptors on these neurons as key regulators of sleep states. When researchers activated GABAA receptors, they observed increased sleep promotion. Furthermore, the administration of baclofen, a GABAB agonist, resulted in extended sleep duration. These findings suggest potential genetic predispositions to sleep disorders and highlight how inherited receptor variations might influence an individual's sleep patterns, potentially impacting their daily functioning, academic performance, and professional life.",
            "Having spent five semesters at University Park, I've experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating our expansive campus. The issue of transportation became particularly evident during my initial year when I resided in East Halls. The journey from my accommodation in Stuart Hall to centrally located facilities like Willard Building could consume nearly half an hour on foot, particularly during State College's notoriously inclement weather.\n\nThe campus landscape has undergone significant transformation in recent years. According to alumni accounts, East Halls was once isolated from main campus by vast undeveloped areas. Today, these spaces have been transformed into athletic facilities, modern structures including the renovated Creamery and medical center, and residential complexes. This continuous expansion has intensified the transportation challenges faced by students.\n\nIn addressing these mobility concerns, bicycles emerge as the optimal solution for campus transportation. However, successful implementation requires both student participation and appropriate infrastructure development.\n\nRecently, a colleague shared their experience of returning to cycling after an extended break. Their enthusiasm was evident: \"I can't believe I ever stopped cycling. Despite its fluctuating popularity, it's truly the most practical transportation method.\" Beyond its health benefits, cycling represents remarkable efficiency in transportation. The energy from a simple breakfast can power a cyclist for dozens of miles.\n\nAs an off-campus resident situated at a distance comparable to some university housing, I've found my bicycle investment invaluable. My daily commute to Thomas Building, which would normally require 25 minutes by foot, takes merely 5 minutes by bicycle at a brisk pace. Though Pollock Road offers the most direct route, it presents certain challenges for all travelers. While walking remains viable, my academic schedule demands greater efficiency. The cumulative time saved by cycling - potentially exceeding 150 minutes weekly when considering various campus commitments - proves essential for maintaining a balanced academic schedule.",
            "In his seminal work Brave New World, Huxley presents a cautionary tale about technological advancement and consumer culture through the lens of a dystopian society. The narrative explores a world where collective identity supersedes individualism, and the pursuit of instant gratification becomes the primary driving force of human existence. Under the watchful eye of the World Controller, the population exists as mere pieces in an elaborate social experiment.\n\nA close analysis through Marxist interpretation reveals deep-seated concerns about societal development and economic systems. The text employs various concepts central to Marxist thought, such as class uniformity and objectification, suggesting that Huxley sought to critique the emerging economic paradigms of his era.\n\nThe novel's treatment of social conditioning mirrors the Marxist concept of false consciousness, wherein populations remain ignorant of their true economic relationships. The lower castes - Deltas, Gammas, and others - exemplify this through their programmed behavior, achieved through sleep-learning techniques that instill consumerist values. This systematic manipulation, orchestrated by the ruling class, demonstrates social dominance theory in action. The privileged classes, while potentially aware of this system, largely maintain their complicity, with few exceptions like Bernard questioning the established order.\n\nThe absence of meaningful interpersonal connections throughout the narrative serves as a powerful metaphor. Characters lack psychological complexity, suggesting that technological progress and consumer culture have stripped humanity of its essential nature. Emotional depth is replaced by superficial interactions, evidenced by the purely physical nature of relationships between men and women. Each social stratum's acceptance of their predetermined role reflects the economic impact of consumer capitalism, where individuals are pacified through false promises of fulfillment through consumption and conformity.",
            "During my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a comparative religion course that delved into Islamic studies. A recurring theme throughout the semester centered on the perception of Islam in modern society. This discussion has only gained significance in contemporary times. The media's portrayal of Islam has undergone a remarkable transformation since the tragic events of September 2001, shifting from overt skepticism to what some might consider excessive accommodation. The political landscape has similarly evolved, as evidenced by the unprecedented acceptance of candidates with Islamic heritage.\n\nUpon examining the traditional biographical accounts of Muhammad, I encountered what appeared to be significant discrepancies between historical records and religious narratives. Historical documentation suggests a military leader who expanded his influence through conquest, yet religious texts paint a portrait of a humble spiritual guide whose followers came to him voluntarily, drawn by his teachings.\n\nThe biographical accounts contain numerous parallels to Christian scripture, particularly in the description of supernatural events. One notable example describes the multiplication of food, reminiscent of similar Biblical narratives. These parallels raise questions about the authenticity and potential motivations behind such accounts, particularly in their apparent attempt to establish religious legitimacy through familiar miraculous motifs.\n\nThe methodology of documentation in these biographical accounts relies heavily on chains of oral transmission, with stories passed through multiple intermediaries before being recorded. While this system was intended to establish credibility, it potentially introduces questions about the reliability of such accounts, as information may have been altered through multiple retellings.\n\nThe disparity between historical evidence and religious narrative regarding Muhammad's character and methods presents a challenging dichotomy. The peaceful, humble figure portrayed in religious texts seems at odds with historical accounts of military campaigns and territorial expansion, raising questions about historical accuracy versus religious interpretation.",
            "In examining the trajectory of Christian theology, one observes a significant divergence between the original teachings of Christ and subsequent doctrinal developments. This historical evolution demonstrates how religious institutions often drift from their foundational principles. Contemporary society exhibits an increasing intellectual curiosity and progressive mindset, though conservative elements persist in maintaining traditional interpretations. These traditionalists, while vocal, may lack the numerical strength to prevent inevitable change.\n\nThe coming decades will likely witness an unprecedented surge in historical consciousness among Christian adherents. This awakening will spark a widespread desire to differentiate between later theological additions and Christ's original message. Though this transformation may span generations, its culmination appears certain: Christianity will experience a fundamental realignment with its roots.\n\nThis theological reformation will systematically deconstruct accumulated doctrine, essentially reversing centuries of theological evolution. The end result may be a stripped-down faith, focused purely on Jesus's divine message, unencumbered by subsequent interpretations. As this movement gains momentum across Western nations, encouraging worship patterns reminiscent of first-century practices, ecclesiastical institutions will maintain their relevance while guiding this transformation. Paradoxically, this retrograde movement will likely reduce the current denominational fragmentation, fostering greater uniformity in belief and practice.\n\nHistorical precedents for such dramatic reversals exist: consider Rome's transformation from persecutor to promoter of Christianity, or America's evolution from slavery to racial inclusion in leadership. This impending religious reformation will be facilitated by adopting metaphorical rather than literal interpretations of Jesus's teachings.\n\nExamining Christianity's origins reveals its emergence from Judaism, which by 63 BCE had established core principles including monotheism, divine revelation, and scriptural authority under Roman occupation. The Jewish community of this period was notably diverse, encompassing various sects including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general populace.",
            "Through a careful analysis of The Jungle, one can observe a compelling portrayal of humanity's inherent tendency toward self-interest and avarice. The narrative expertly illustrates how individuals, particularly those in positions of power, consistently prioritize personal gain over collective welfare. This dynamic manifests most prominently in the industrial leadership's behavior.\n\nThe factory proprietors and administrators demonstrate an unwavering focus on expansion and profit maximization, displaying minimal concern for collateral damage. As Sinclair vividly describes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery effectively conveys the environmental devastation wrought by unchecked industrialization. The administration's indifference extends to both environmental degradation and sanitation issues, including the widespread contamination from livestock facilities throughout Packingtown.\n\nThe exploitation of human capital represents another facet of this systemic dysfunction. As the text states, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" The absence of labor protection legislation during this period enabled widespread worker exploitation, including arbitrary terminations and hazardous working conditions.\n\nThe residents of Packingtown endured these deplorable circumstances without recourse to protective agencies or advocacy organizations. While labor unions existed, they often exploited rather than protected their members. The text draws a powerful parallel between these workers and chattel slavery: \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Literary scholars have long debated the influences behind Edgar Allan Poe's haunting poem \"Dream-Land.\" The work, which incorporates the mysterious term \"Thulé,\" demonstrates fascinating connections to both classical and contemporary sources. While some academics point to Virgil's use of the term - referring to a mythical northern island beyond Britain - a compelling argument exists for more recent inspirations.\n\nThe German literary tradition, particularly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's masterwork \"Faust,\" offers intriguing parallels. Within \"Faust Part Two\" (1832), we find \"The King of Thulé,\" a melancholic ballad about a grieving monarch who, after his queen's death, receives a golden goblet as her final gift. The narrative concludes with the king's dramatic suicide after disposing of this precious memento in the ocean's depths.\n\nThe thematic resonance between Goethe's ballad and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is striking. Both works explore realms of profound loss, isolation, and psychological torment. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" traverses a colorless landscape populated by spectral memories, mirroring the emotional desolation of Goethe's bereaved king. Poe's repeated use of \"Thulé\" - appearing at both the beginning and end of the poem - creates a symbolic framework that echoes the German master's exploration of mortality and despair.\n\nGoethe's influence on nineteenth-century literature was considerable, and Poe's awareness of his work seems certain. Not only was Goethe highly regarded by Alfred Tennyson, whom Poe deeply respected, but numerous English adaptations of his works circulated in American literary circles. H.P. Grattan's 1842 dramatic adaptation of \"Faust\" preceded Poe's use of \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" by mere months, suggesting a direct line of influence.",
            "Examining Punitive Damages in California Premises Liability: Analysis of Customer Injury Due to Management Negligence\n\nThis analysis explores whether punitive damages could be justified in a slip-and-fall incident where store management demonstrated potential negligence. The case involves D&D Markets, where customer Jennifer Palmer sustained serious injuries after falling on an unremediated applesauce spill.\n\nThe incident timeline reveals concerning management behavior. At approximately 5:00 PM, employee Rich Wayne reported the hazard to manager Paul Martin. Fifteen minutes later, staff member Mary J. Haddigan reiterated this safety concern. In both instances, Martin dismissed the warnings, citing his dinner break as precedence. The plaintiff's injury occurred at 5:30 PM, marking a 30-minute window of inaction. Notably, D&D Markets had documented five similar incidents within the same calendar year.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 3294(a) establishes that punitive damages may be awarded upon demonstration of \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute further clarifies that malicious conduct encompasses actions showing \"willful and conscious disregard\" for others' safety. Precedent established in Taylor v. Superior Court emphasizes that awareness of probable dangers, coupled with deliberate failure to address them, constitutes malicious conduct.\n\nGiven these parameters, the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages warrants consideration. The manager's repeated dismissal of safety warnings, particularly in light of the establishment's history of similar incidents, suggests conscious disregard for customer safety. While proving \"despicable\" conduct presents a higher hurdle, the pattern of negligence and prioritization of personal convenience over customer safety provides substantial grounds for the claim to proceed.\n\nBased on these factors, summary dismissal of the punitive damages claim would be inappropriate, as sufficient evidence exists to support the plaintiff's position.",
            "The emptiness first manifested during her early adolescence. At fourteen, an inexplicable void took residence in her heart, persisting well into her seventeenth year. Time revealed that this yearning wasn't for an object but for companionship, though not in any conventional sense. Despite numerous admirers and awkward courtships, no male suitor sparked her interest. This peculiarity prompted considerable self-reflection, yet years of introspection yielded no satisfactory explanation for her apparent immunity to teenage romance.\n\nThe domestic atmosphere in which she grew up was remarkably serene. Her parents exemplified harmony, rarely engaging in disputes. The only source of tension arose from their daughter's fierce independence, which contrasted sharply with their placid nature. Her vibrant personality and genuine kindness made her universally appealing, creating an interesting dynamic within their peaceful household.\n\nThe tranquility shattered one afternoon when an agonized cry echoed from the kitchen. Racing toward the sound, she discovered her mother sprawled across the floor, clearly in distress. Between labored breaths, her mother managed to request immediate medical attention. Drawing upon her strength training, she carefully lifted her injured parent and transported her to their vehicle, laying her across the back seat before heading to the emergency room.\n\nThe hospital's sterile environment barely registered as she rushed through the entrance, calling urgently for medical assistance. Healthcare professionals quickly surrounded them, transferring her mother onto a gurney before whisking her away for examination. Left alone in the waiting area, anxiety consumed her thoughts as she recalled the simple accident that precipitated this crisis - her mother's unfortunate fall from a stepstool while reaching for a decorative vase in their highest cabinet.",
            "Recent research investigated the correlation between cardiovascular health outcomes and compliance with Mediterranean-style eating patterns, as quantified by the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) scoring system. The traditional Mediterranean dietary approach emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes while incorporating healthy fats from sources like fish and nuts. This eating pattern limits animal products and saturated fats but permits reasonable alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated promising connections between Mediterranean eating patterns and improved cardiovascular outcomes, including reduced mortality rates. Additionally, clinical trials have shown advantages over conventional low-fat diets regarding weight management and cholesterol profiles among overweight participants. However, the specific impact on stroke risk remained relatively unexplored.\n\nThe investigation tracked 74,886 female healthcare professionals aged 38-63 years, all participants in the broader Nurses' Health Study encompassing 121,700 women across 11 states. None had pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or diabetes. Between 1984 and 2004, researchers evaluated dietary habits through periodic food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), maintaining an impressive 95% participant retention rate. The study team verified reported cardiovascular events through medical documentation, though approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks were classified as \"probable\" cases due to limited record availability.\n\nTo enhance accuracy, researchers calculated rolling averages of aMed scores across multiple questionnaires. The analysis incorporated various health and lifestyle factors, including exercise habits, smoking status, and hormone therapy use. Statistical evaluation employed Cox proportional-hazard models to examine relationships between dietary patterns and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe findings revealed significant protective effects associated with stronger Mediterranean diet adherence. Over two decades of observation, researchers documented 2,391 coronary events, 1,763 strokes, and 1,077 cardiovascular-related deaths. Participants with the highest aMed scores demonstrated a 29% lower risk of both coronary events and strokes compared to those with the lowest scores.",
            "A lone figure emerges on an urban corner - actress Ellen Page (known for her role in Juno) holding aloft a makeshift cardboard sign. Its message is jarring: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"\n\nMyanmar, formerly Burma, has languished under military dictatorship since a 1962 governmental overthrow. The nation witnessed unprecedented civil unrest in 2007 when Buddhist monastics initiated what became known as the \"Saffron Revolution\" - named for their distinctive orange-hued garments. As public participation swelled, initial government tolerance gave way to systematic violence against religious institutions nationwide. International media faced severe restrictions; notably, Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai lost his life documenting these events on September 27th. While official statistics cite merely 13 casualties, military defector Colonel Hla Win revealed a far grimmer reality: \"The actual death count reaches thousands.\"\n\nSuch oppression echoes throughout history. Ancient Rome's emperors claimed divine mandate for absolute power. Japanese imperial mythology elevated rulers to divine status. Even modern governance shows concerning parallels, as evidenced by certain political-religious alliances in contemporary America.\n\nHistorical precedents abound: China's Tiananmen Square incident in 1989 saw casualties ranging from official estimates of 200-300 to Chinese Red Cross figures of 2,000-3,000. The 1994 Rwandan crisis witnessed government-backed Hutu militias systematically eliminating Tutsis and moderate politicians regardless of ethnicity. The Holocaust under Nazi Germany's regime represents perhaps the most infamous example of systematic state-sponsored persecution.",
            "The remarkable impact of Edward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington on jazz music stems primarily from his extended career and exceptional talent for orchestral innovation. While his piano work often maintains a reserved presence in many compositions, his true genius manifested in creating intricate musical arrangements that capitalized on his musicians' unique strengths. The framework he developed allowed for both spontaneous improvisation and meticulously arranged sections, carefully designed to showcase the distinctive styles of individual performers.\n\nThe orchestral landscape he painted demonstrated an extraordinary understanding of collective sound dynamics. His ability to weave together individual talents into a cohesive ensemble resulted in groundbreaking jazz compositions that continue to influence musicians today.\n\nAccording to Grove Music's scholarly analysis, compositions like \"Creole Love Call\" exemplify his revolutionary approach to incorporating vocals as an instrumental element. This piece, structured as a twelve-bar blues with six distinct choruses, demonstrates his masterful arrangement techniques:\n\nThe initial chorus presents an interplay between vocals and reed instruments, transitioning from smooth to textured tones.\nFollowing this, a muted trumpet emerges with elaborate blue note expressions.\nThe third section features an ethereal clarinet solo, accompanied by delicate piano rhythms.\nA full orchestral interpretation of the opening theme appears in the fourth chorus.\nThe piece reaches its apex in the fifth chorus with high-register reed sections leading the call-and-response.\nThe final chorus mirrors the opening structure but incorporates instrumental-style vocal techniques.\nThe composition concludes with a brief coda featuring vocal flourishes and unconventional trombone elements.\n\nThis innovative approach to vocal integration appears consistently throughout his repertoire. In \"Hot and Bothered\" (1928), Ellington masterfully combines Miley's trumpet work with Cox's vocal scatting, creating an unprecedented tonal fusion. This experimental approach continued in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Nanton's trombone work introduces the memorable melody with distinctive muted effects.",
            "What factors determine evolutionary trajectories in living organisms? Scientists have long pondered the mechanisms that guide evolutionary modifications. Despite significant advances since D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 observation regarding the lack of mathematical descriptions for biological forms, contemporary researchers still grapple with similar challenges. Recent developments have incorporated mathematical frameworks to analyze mollusk shell development across both individual growth and evolutionary timescales, as demonstrated by researchers like Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur research investigates Prunum species, integrating mathematical modeling with empirical studies to understand developmental and evolutionary patterns. Through X-ray imaging, we identified measurable characteristics that enabled us to model both theoretical and actual shell configurations using CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). By generating theoretical morphologies, we established potential morphological boundaries within Prunum. These computational results, combined with laboratory observations, enhance our comprehension of major evolutionary transitions in this group.\n\nGastropod shells exhibit a fascinating architectural pattern: a tubular structure that coils through space in 360-degree rotations. These rotational segments, termed whorls, encircle a central columella. The growth rate between whorls varies, with visible suture lines marking whorl boundaries. The final whorl, known as the body whorl, typically represents the largest section, while preceding whorls constitute the spire. The shell structure extends from the apex (uppermost point) to the base, featuring an aperture through which the organism emerges.\n\nShell morphology can be examined from multiple perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Standard scientific illustration presents shells in apertural view, displaying the opening while oriented apex-upward.\n\nWhorl quantification follows a standardized protocol. Beginning with an apical perspective, researchers identify the initial suture point and establish a reference line. Whorl counts proceed from this marker, measured to quarter-whorl precision.\n\nShell development can be conceptualized as a temporal sequence of apertures, tracking the organism's shell secretion process. This growth pattern can be mapped using aperture center coordinates and dimensional measurements, enabling both visual and mathematical representation. Such mathematical frameworks facilitate the exploration of various developmental scenarios through parameter modification.",
            "Over the past decade, Indonesia's statistics regarding newborn and infant deaths have shown minimal change. Despite making progress on various Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation sectors, improvements in both child and maternal wellness fall significantly behind the benchmarks established for 2015. Several factors contribute to these deficiencies, suggesting that a comprehensive healthcare reform might prove more beneficial than isolated program-based solutions.\n\nAlthough Indonesia now reports that 72% of childbirths involve qualified healthcare personnel, this figure warrants closer examination. The classification encompasses traditional birthing assistants, including local midwives, who lack the medical expertise to handle complications such as severe bleeding during delivery. Thus, while the statistics appear promising, they mask underlying inadequacies in the system. Furthermore, recent trends show fewer children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrheal conditions, and available information suggests inadequate post-birth care nationwide.\n\nSurgical delivery rates present additional concerns, hovering around 4% overall. More troubling is the stark urban-rural divide, with cities reporting 7% cesarean deliveries compared to just 2% in rural regions. This disparity highlights a broader issue of healthcare accessibility, which heavily favors urban populations. Economic inequality further compounds this problem, with a 27-percentage-point difference in healthcare utilization between the highest and lowest income groups, largely due to direct medical expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance maternal and infant care metrics, policymakers face a crucial decision between targeted interventions and broad healthcare system improvements. While specialized programs offer clear objectives and quick wins, they come with significant drawbacks. Such focused approaches often drain resources from other crucial health services and attract healthcare workers away from general practice. Moreover, multiple parallel initiatives frequently result in redundant services and administrative inefficiencies, as evidenced by the impact of HIV/AIDS funding on family planning resources.",
            "Over the last century, the scope of Popular Music has expanded exponentially, encompassing numerous genres that defy simple categorization. Each primary genre - whether it's rap, rock, country, jazz, or folk - has branched into countless subgenres, creating an intricate musical tapestry. Among these, Heavy Metal stands out as particularly fascinating, having evolved into one of popular music's most complex and emotionally charged genres since its emergence four decades ago.\n\nHeavy Metal's emotional palette, while predominantly exploring darker themes, demonstrates remarkable range and depth. The genre's adaptability became evident shortly after its inception, as musicians began experimenting with its foundations, spawning successive waves of subgenres. This continuous evolution persists to this day, creating an ever-expanding musical universe.\n\nContemporary Heavy Metal presents such diversity that defining its core characteristics has become increasingly challenging. While it has absorbed influences from various musical traditions, understanding its origins remains crucial. To truly grasp modern metal's significance, one must examine it not merely as a genre but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nAt its essence, Heavy Metal embodies intensity and excess - in volume, instrumental proficiency, theatrical presentation, and emotional expression. Unlike some genres, metal demands technical mastery; its practitioners consistently demonstrate exceptional musicianship. The movement's development was significantly influenced by the psychedelic revolution of the 1970s, when drug experimentation led to groundbreaking sonic innovations. Metal distinguished itself by embracing darker themes at a time when mainstream music generally avoided such territory. Modern metal continues to draw inspiration from the dramatic intensity characteristic of Romantic Era compositions.\n\nConsider \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles - often cited as an early metal prototype. Created as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier sound, this track showcased the band's ability to venture into darker territory, featuring themes of destabilization commonly associated with drug experiences. Its inclusion on The White Album marked a significant moment in metal's prehistory.",
            "In the late nineteenth century, preceding the emergence of Surrealism, an extraordinary artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously creating visual narratives that transcended conventional artistic boundaries. His masterpiece from 1910, The Dream, exemplifies both the literal representation of a woman experiencing an enchanted vision and symbolizes Rousseau's personal aspirations within the artistic community. Throughout his artistic journey, Rousseau grappled with a fundamental challenge: whether to embrace established artistic conventions to gain acceptance or maintain his distinctive creative voice.\n\nUnderstanding this artistic tension requires examination of Rousseau's background. Born in 1844 in Laval, France, he emerged from a middle-class environment, with his father operating a successful hardware business. Notably, Rousseau's artistic journey deviated from traditional paths, as he lacked formal training and spent his early career as a municipal toll collector until age forty. Personal tragedy marked his life significantly, with the loss of eight children in infancy and his first wife, Clémence, leaving him to raise his surviving daughter Julia alone. Art became his sanctuary and means of emotional restoration.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries who idealized rural life in their works, Rousseau maintained an authentic folk-art perspective, reflecting the genuine aspirations and experiences of his social class. His late entry into the art world coincided with the rise of prominent modern artists like Matisse. According to art historian Jan Gordon's \"Modern French Painters,\" while Matisse actively sought to challenge artistic conventions, Rousseau paradoxically strived for acceptance through conformity to established artistic standards, hoping to gain membership in the prestigious Artiste Français.",
            "Throughout history, philosophers and scholars have observed striking parallels between moral principles and artistic expression, suggesting these domains share fundamental connections. This relationship becomes apparent when examining how humans process both ethical decisions and aesthetic experiences. While traditional learning occurs through structured education or direct experience, our understanding of morality and beauty seems to emerge from a deeper, more intuitive source.\n\nWhen analyzing either ethical principles or artistic merit, we typically focus on describing existing phenomena rather than establishing rigid guidelines. Critics and philosophers attempt to explain why certain actions feel morally correct or why particular artworks resonate with viewers, instead of creating strict rulebooks for moral behavior or artistic creation.\n\nInterestingly, neither artistic criticism nor ethical analysis can fully capture the essence of their subjects. Consider discussions about masterpieces like the Mona Lisa – while experts may analyze technical elements such as composition and historical significance, these aspects alone cannot explain its enduring impact. Similarly, when people discuss their favorite artistic works, they often preface detailed analysis with intuitive responses, suggesting an ineffable quality beyond technical description.\n\nThis transcendent aspect appears in both artistic appreciation and moral understanding. Literary works, in particular, demonstrate this connection most clearly. Unlike other art forms, literature inherently incorporates moral dimensions, as it reflects human experiences and value systems. The written word serves as a unique bridge between aesthetic beauty and ethical contemplation, allowing us to explore complex moral territories through artistic expression.\n\nThe profound connection between ethics and aesthetics stems from their shared appeal to our intuitive understanding. Both domains affect us at a level beyond rational explanation, operating in what philosophers might call the realm of pure experience. This special characteristic, this indefinable quality, creates a natural bond between moral truth and artistic beauty, particularly evident in literary works where human values and artistic expression seamlessly intertwine.",
            "Modern Germany stands as a unified nation, its distinctive cultural fabric woven seamlessly from Munich's alpine foothills to the northern ports of Kiel on the Baltic coast. This cultural tapestry extends from Cologne's Rhine-side boulevards through the heartland to Dresden's baroque splendor along the Elbe. The rich mosaic of contemporary German identity reflects its diverse origins, emerging from numerous historical tribes and principalities.\n\nThe ancestral homeland, historically termed Germania, carries a name whose origins spark scholarly debate. Historical records indicate various potential etymologies. According to Roman accounts, particularly those of Tacitus, the term derived from a tribe called the Tungri, who had previously been known as \"Germans\" before their Rhine crossing and subsequent conflicts with Gallic forces. Julius Caesar's \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\" introduced \"Germanus\" into Roman literature, adopting Gallic terminology to differentiate between conquered and unconquered peoples beyond the Rhine. Linguistic scholars propose alternative origins, suggesting connections to ancient weaponry terminology (the \"ger\" spear) or Celtic linguistic roots meaning \"neighbor\" or \"shouter.\"\n\nTacitus's ethnographic work \"Germania\" (98 CE) presents a fascinating perspective on these peoples, describing them as indigenous to their territories and relatively unmixed with other populations. He emphasizes the region's forbidding nature, questioning why anyone would choose such harsh terrain over Mediterranean comforts unless it were their native land.\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania developed primarily through commerce and military recruitment rather than settlement. While Roman expeditions ventured into Germanic territories for resources and campaigns, permanent Roman settlement remained limited. Germanic tribes, establishing themselves during the first century CE, maintained a complex relationship with the Empire, engaging in trade and military service while preserving their independence along Roman frontiers.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night explores the complex relationship between identity and deception, suggesting that while masquerade serves immediate purposes, its prolonged use threatens authentic selfhood. The resolution of such pretense often forces an uncomfortable choice: maintaining personal integrity versus preserving social bonds. When deceptions unravel, reactions vary dramatically – some shrug it off, while others experience deep betrayal.\n\nThe gender-bending elements of the narrative raise particularly intriguing questions about motivation and necessity. Consider Viola's circumstances: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). Her adoption of masculine attire emerges from survival instinct in unfamiliar territory, yet this protective strategy inadvertently severs potential female friendships and creates romantic complications.\n\nThese complications manifest most notably in Olivia's misplaced affections – \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138) – and in Orsino's conflicted emotions: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261). Contemporary audiences might interpret these entanglements as Shakespeare's commentary on fluid sexuality and hidden desires. However, Olivia's swift transfer of affection from Cesario to Sebastian suggests a different reading: rather than exploring latent same-sex attraction, Shakespeare appears to satirize superficial attraction based purely on appearance.\n\nThis interpretation gains credence through Olivia's eventual acceptance of Viola as family rather than lover: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). The resolution demonstrates how deception, while temporarily useful for unveiling suppressed emotions, must ultimately yield to authentic relationships based on truth.",
            "Historical accounts frequently highlight the harsh nature of German colonial administration, particularly regarding the tragic events involving the Ovaherero and Nama peoples. However, painting an entire colonial empire with a single brush would be an oversimplification. The reality reveals a tapestry of administrative approaches across different territories, including varying educational strategies.\n\nWhen examining educational outcomes, fascinating contrasts emerge. Following their 1919 acquisition of German East Africa (Tanganyika), British administrators encountered a surprisingly well-educated indigenous population. Similar educational achievements were documented in Kamerun by writers of the period. However, the educational landscape in South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) tells a markedly different story.\n\nUnlike the state-sponsored educational initiatives seen in East Africa, South West African indigenous education relied almost exclusively on missionary organizations, which received minimal governmental assistance. Interestingly, the administration allocated substantial resources toward European education in the territory, establishing government schools and providing enhanced support for missionary institutions serving white settlers. These educational disparities created lasting implications. While other former German territories produced numerous educated indigenous individuals, South West Africa's native population remained largely unexposed to formal education. Multiple factors contributed to this unique situation, warranting further investigation into settler attitudes and administrative policies.\n\nScholarly literature examining education in German colonies is extensive, predominantly consisting of German-language sources from the early 1900s. Initial research focused primarily on describing educational frameworks, while subsequent English-language studies introduced comparative analyses and detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. Cohen's research comparing South West African and East African education systems stands out, suggesting that South West Africa's substantial settler population significantly influenced its educational development.\n\nThe territory's relatively moderate climate, despite its predominantly desert landscape, attracted a significant European presence. By 1913, South West Africa hosted nearly 15,000 European settlers, almost triple the white population of East Africa, the next most populated German colony.",
            "During the mid-19th century, Mexico and the United States experienced significant tensions that lasted nearly six decades, from 1836 until 1893. This period of strained relations reached its peak during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), resulting in America's acquisition of Texas and southwestern territories. Conflicts persisted between these neighboring nations until shortly before World War I, stemming from fundamental differences in faith, societal values, and economic interests.\n\nBorder conflicts frequently characterize relationships between adjacent countries, and the Mexican-American dynamic proves no exception. Historical records indicate that among Latin American nations, only Mexico and Cuba maintained prolonged diplomatic tensions with the United States, largely due to their geographic proximity.\n\nReligious differences played a crucial role in this historical antagonism. Just as 20th-century Americans opposed totalitarian ideologies, their 18th and 19th-century predecessors harbored strong anti-Catholic sentiments. This religious divide mirrors other historical conflicts, such as the ideological component of U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War. The seeds of this religious antipathy trace back to Anglo-Spanish rivalries, which both nations inherited from their respective colonial powers.\n\nHistorical documentation reveals 17 distinct confrontations between these nations during their 57-year period of rivalry. Most incidents involved cross-border violence and frontier-related disputes. Both countries eventually deployed military forces along their shared border to address persistent bandit activity targeting frontier settlements.\n\nThe rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico developed increasing economic ties with the United States. By the century's end, American interests had shifted from territorial expansion to commercial investment in Mexico, fundamentally altering the relationship between these neighboring nations.",
            "In 2008, my life transformed dramatically when a rare medical condition struck without warning. At the time, I was working in healthcare, having chosen the field primarily for its promise of job security - a decision driven by my unstable childhood. Despite harboring dreams of pursuing scientific research or journalism, I followed the conventional wisdom that medical professions would always be in demand.\n\nThe irony wasn't lost on me when, at age 46, I found myself unable to work, single, and financially vulnerable. Now, after more than a decade receiving disability benefits, I've watched my personal assets dwindle to practically nothing. Each day presents new challenges to my dignity and sense of security. However, one truth remains crystal clear: survival would have been impossible without my support network of family members and close friends. When crisis strikes, even the strongest among us need helping hands.\n\nLife's uncertainties - whether minor inconveniences or major catastrophes - will always exist. No amount of preparation can fully insulate us from needing assistance when truly significant challenges arise.\n\nWhile I support reducing dependence on government institutions (which have certainly shown their limitations), I believe the solution lies in strengthening community bonds rather than retreating into individual fortresses. The narrative of America being built on \"rugged individualism\" overlooks a crucial historical fact: our ancestors survived through cooperation and resource-sharing. Consider the westward expansion - those wagon trains succeeded through collective effort, not isolation.\n\nI'm certainly an advocate for emergency preparedness. My own home contains disaster supplies: medical kits, water treatment supplies, protective materials, emergency lighting, and shelf-stable food. For those with the means, maintaining a small farm or installing alternative heating sources makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever, the most valuable preparation might be simply reaching out to those living nearby. Community resilience often proves more sustainable than individual readiness.",
            "The origins of Buddhism can be traced to approximately 500 BCE, when an individual later known as the Buddha emerged from princely origins. His journey toward enlightenment and subsequent teachings established what would evolve into various Buddhist traditions, with Theravada emerging as the most traditional branch. As with any ancient faith spanning millennia, modern Buddhist practice has undergone significant transformations. Consider, for example, the water-cutting ritual performed annually in Sri Lanka - a ceremony absent from original Buddhist teachings, yet embraced by both religious officials and ordinary practitioners alike. Such evolutionary changes extend beyond mere customs to influence fundamental religious principles. The Buddhist faith community has adapted its core teachings in response to various influences, both from within and without, some supportive and others challenging.\n\nTo properly analyze these changes, we must establish clear definitions. When examining influences, we distinguish between those originating from within the Buddhist community (internal) and those from non-Buddhist sources (external). Additionally, we categorize these forces as either antagonistic - seeking to undermine Buddhist practice - or neutral, which may inadvertently impact the faith despite having no explicit agenda regarding Buddhism.\n\nUnderstanding contemporary Theravada Buddhism requires familiarity with its foundational elements. Central to the faith is devotion to three primary aspects: the enlightened teacher, his message, and the monastic community. Buddhist scripture is organized into three collections: discourses, monastic regulations, and philosophical teachings. Key philosophical concepts include the absence of a permanent self, life's inherent challenges, and universal impermanence. Recognition of these principles is considered essential for breaking free from the continuous cycle of existence, thereby eliminating negative qualities such as craving, animosity, and misconception. The religious code prescribes different levels of commitment - lay practitioners follow five basic moral guidelines, while monastics adhere to more extensive regulations. The framework of Buddhism rests upon four fundamental realities: life contains suffering, attachment breeds suffering, liberation from suffering is possible, and there exists a path toward such liberation."
