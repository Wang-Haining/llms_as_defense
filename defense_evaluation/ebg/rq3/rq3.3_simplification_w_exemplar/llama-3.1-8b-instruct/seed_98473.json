            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep disorder: the biological model and the sociocultural model. The biological model looks at genetic information and medical health. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects sleep. We will explain these models and discuss the research that supports them.\n\nA sleep disorder is a problem with sleeping. It can be a main problem or a problem related to another health issue. There are two main types of sleep disorders: primary sleep disorders and sleep disorders related to mental health. Primary sleep disorders include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and breathing sleep disorder. Insomnia is a problem with sleeping at night, hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake, and narcolepsy is a problem with falling asleep suddenly. \n\nThe biological model of sleep focuses on genes and the body's physical parts that control sleep. Scientists have found that special cells in the brain called orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. They tested this idea on mice and found that special receptors on these cells help control sleep. If these receptors are not working correctly, it can cause problems with sleep. This shows that genetics and the body can affect sleep. This means that if someone has a problem with these receptors, they may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the environment and our surroundings affect sleep. This can include things like our culture, family, and income level. People from different cultures may have different sleep patterns. For example, some cultures sleep a lot during the day and are awake at night. This can affect how well they do in school or at work. If someone's environment is not good for sleep, it can cause problems with sleep.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). We will explain three main parts. First, we will define CAPD. Next, we will explain how doctors diagnose the disorder. Finally, we will talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. The brain cannot properly understand sounds. People with CAPD can hear normally. They do not have trouble hearing. But their brain has trouble understanding what they hear. It is like when you hear many noises and have trouble understanding what someone is saying.\n\nThe first mention of CAPD was in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children who had trouble communicating. They developed tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, another researcher introduced a way to test how the brain uses sound information. A big conference in 1977 helped researchers learn more about CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may have trouble understanding two or more sounds at the same time. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may not be able to tell if someone is being serious or joking. One sound can cover up another sound. They may not be able to understand how to use sound clues. And they may not be able to understand how sounds come in order.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors use different methods. They watch the patient's behavior and perform tests on their hearing. Doctors may use questionnaires and surveys, or watch how the patient responds to different sounds. There is no one test that works for everyone. There is no known reason why CAPD happens. Tests may present many sounds at the same time and ask the patient to choose the right one.\n\nIn a regular classroom, a teacher can help a student with CAPD. The teacher can provide extra help with listening and following directions. The teacher can also use visual aids to help the student understand what is being said. For example, the teacher can write down what they are saying. This can help the student understand better. The teacher can also seat the student in a quiet area of the classroom to help them focus.",

            "German rule in Africa was very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. But this is not the full story of the German colonial rule. The rule was different in different places and the treatment of people was not the same everywhere. \n\nIn German East Africa, the British found many Africans who could read and write when they took control in 1919. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. People wrote about these good things at the time.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa, now called Namibia, was very different. The government did not make many schools for Africans like they did in East Africa. Instead, some missionary groups helped with education, but they did not get much help from the government. The government did make schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools more. This made a big difference in South West Africa. While many Africans in other colonies were able to read and write, most people in South West Africa were not educated. \n\nThere are many books about education in the German colonies. Most of these books were written in German and were written a long time ago. They just told about the schools in the colonies. Later, more books were written in English. They compared the schools in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. One important book looked at the schools in South West Africa and East Africa. The author said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was a big reason for the difference in the education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land is hot desert. Many white people lived in South West Africa because of the good climate. By 1913, there were 15,000 white people living there. In contrast, only 5,336 white people lived in East Africa.",
            "Popular music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over the last 100 years. There are many different kinds of music, and it is hard to make a complete list. Most music styles have smaller groups inside them. For example, rock music has many small groups like metal, jazz, and folk. The metal music group is one of the most interesting and expressive music styles in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it shows a wide range of feelings, mostly the sad or scary kinds. It is diverse because people started to make their own kinds of metal music after it began. This started a chain of smaller groups and smaller groups inside those groups.\n\nToday, it is hard to say what metal music really is. It has taken ideas from other music styles, but it came from somewhere. To understand modern metal music, we need to know what metal music is and why it is a movement.\n\nMetal music is often about darkness. It is often louder and more violent than other music. Metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments. The music is different from other music because it is not simple. It is a movement that was influenced by drug use in the 1970s. People used drugs to create new and crazy sounds. Metal music has many qualities that are not found in other music, like feelings of sadness and fear. Later metal musicians took some of these qualities from the Romantic Era. Some examples of metal music show the darker side of emotions. For example, the Beatles wrote a song called Helter Skelter. It shows the ups and downs of life, like the effects of drugs. This song is often called one of the first metal songs. The Beatles wanted to show that they could be as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a painter in the early nineteen hundreds. He dreamed of making beautiful pictures that people would love. He wanted to be known and respected by other artists and art lovers. His famous painting \"The Dream\" is like a picture of his own dreams and goals. But he had a big problem. He wanted to make his own kind of art, not like other famous painters. He wanted to be unique.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know a little bit about his life. He was born in a town in northwest France in eighteen forty-four. His father was a maker of metal things and a seller. He was a happy man with a good life. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for many years doing a job for the city. When he was forty, he started painting. He wanted to make art to make himself feel better after a sad time in his life.\n\nMany other artists were making good art at the same time as Rousseau. He was not famous until a long time after he started painting. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not want to copy others. He wanted to make his own kind of art. The author Jan Gordon said that Rousseau wanted to make art that was simple, so people would like it. On the other hand, a famous artist named Matisse wanted to make art that was new and different.\n\nRousseau was a folk painter. He made pictures that everyday people could understand. He was not like other artists who made pictures of peasants and made them look beautiful. Rousseau's pictures were like the people who lived in his town.\n\nHis main problem was that he wanted to be accepted by the art world. He wanted to be like other famous artists, but he did not want to copy them. He wanted to be different.",
            "Many people think there is a close connection between right and wrong and what is beautiful. I believe there is a reason for this. The famous writer John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through school or experience. But we like what is right and what is beautiful without being taught. Both right and beautiful are ways to describe, not to tell us what to do. We try to understand why something is good or beautiful, but we can't fully explain it. \n\nFor example, people may talk about the painting Mona Lisa by da Vinci. They may say it has good background, contrast, and setting. But these do not explain why it is great art. When we talk about something we like, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This \"something\" is hard to explain. I think right and beautiful have this same \"something.\" The writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We can describe a story or its qualities, but there is still something more. I think right and good have this same quality. \n\nEthics and aesthetics, or right and beautiful, are closely connected because we experience them in the same way. We can feel them, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is stronger in literature. The writer McKean said, \"Literature is unique because of its moral quality.\" Literature is important to us because it shows us values. We use values in life, and literature helps us understand them.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is a united country with a special culture. This culture comes from many different parts of Germany. People in Germany live near mountains and rivers like the Rhine. They live in cities like Munich, Kiel, and Dresden.\n\nGermany has a long history. It comes from several different tribes and groups. The word 'Germany' comes from many different sources. Some people think it comes from a group of people called the Tungrians. They lived in the area before the river Rhine.\n\nThe Roman writer Julius Caesar first used the word 'German' in his book about the Gauls. He used it to talk about the people he fought against. He read this word from the Gauls themselves. They used it to talk about their neighbors.\n\nJulius Caesar wrote that the Germans lived beyond the river Rhine. They were at war with the Gauls all the time. The Gauls and Germans fought each other every day. \n\nSome people think the word 'German' comes from a spear called a 'ger'. This is a type of spear that people used in battles. Others think it comes from a word in the Old Irish language. This word means 'to shout'. It might mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus wrote a book about the Germans in AD 98. He said that the Germans were an old group of people. They did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild place with bad weather and strong people.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germany. They went to Germany to get things and to fight. They would come back to their big empire. The Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and worked for the Romans.",
            "I looked down at the view in front of me.  I was not thinking about it.  My mind was a blank.  I was studying it, but I was not thinking about it.  I was just looking.\n\nI wanted to learn to draw when I was six years old.  An artist I worked with told me to buy a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  The book teaches you how to draw.  It teaches you how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines.\n\nThe book says to put a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simpler.  I could not do that right then.  I was looking at a bowl of fruit.  I was amazed.\n\nMany famous artists saw the world differently.  Picasso liked blue.  Monet liked green.  I thought my picture could be like theirs.  I looked at the bowl and thought it was the start of my picture.\n\nMy hand went to the pencil.  I wanted to draw.  But I had to clean the toilet instead.  There was a brown package in the toilet bowl.  I tried to move it, but it was stuck.  The package was a problem.  I used a mop to try and move it.  But the mop was not working.\n\nI stood back and thought.  Then I used the toilet paper to clean the bowl.  I had to get the package out.  I dipped my hand into the bowl to get it.  It was not easy.",
            "Many young people die in car accidents.  There are several reasons for this.  One reason is that the brains of teenagers are not yet ready to handle the dangers of driving.  Teenagers also do not have much driving experience.  This lack of experience causes many serious accidents, including rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeenagers often drive with their friends, which makes the situation worse.  A study looked at how old the passengers are when accidents happen.  The study found a strong connection between the age of the passenger and the number of accidents.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teenagers by giving them temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and do not allow other teenagers to be passengers.  However, I think these temporary licenses are not enough.  The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that even 18-year-olds are too young to drive without restrictions.  He has done research that shows people under 19-20 years old often want to take risks just for the fun of it.  It makes sense to wait until this tendency to take risks goes away before giving teenagers a regular driver's license.  If we continue to give licenses to young teens, many more people will die in car accidents.\n\nWe can make a law to solve this problem.  Schools can teach driving classes to future drivers.  But no one under 18 can drive a car.  A temporary permit can still be given before a regular license.  And drivers need to practice for a certain number of hours with a grown-up.  The number of hours can be the same as most states already require.  For example, in California, drivers need 6 hours of practice with a grown-up and 50 hours of practice on their own.  A national law would be a good way to keep teenagers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it is a good idea to make driving safer for everyone.",
            "I looked at the movies from the early days of film. I wanted to see the trick films made by Thomas Edison. There were fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make things look real. My study of these films focused on how they worked and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of the trick films from this time period are set inside a theater. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style of filmmaking comes from theater and magic shows.\n\nOne of the things that all the trick films have in common is that they are filmed inside a theater set. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style was very popular at the time and came from theater and magic shows. \n\nIn these films, the actors usually move side-to-side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors come in from one side and move back and forth. They do not move towards or away from the camera.\n\nThe trick films also use long and medium shots. They almost never use close-up shots. This comes from theater and magic shows, where the whole performance is seen at once. In these early films, the actors do not move towards the camera, so close-up shots are not used.\n\nMost trick films from this time are very short. They are usually a minute or less. This is because they are made up of one idea or one action. However, a single \"shot\" can be made up of many parts. This is how the trick films make people disappear or appear. Look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) to see an example of this. If you look closely, you can see where the different parts of the film are joined together to make the illusion work.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of the Republican Party. He was a farmer, but his work and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions. He believed in personal freedom and a limited government.\n\nTaylor thought that the United States was special because it had no old traditions to follow. This gave its leaders the chance to make a perfect system of government. He believed people have basic rights that must not be taken away. If one right is denied, all are lost. These rights must be safe from the government.\n\nTaylor said that in nature, strong people often get what they want. But in a society, this should not happen. He believed a good government must understand the good and bad in people. Taylor thought a government with good principles would be fair, even if its leaders are not.\n\nHe believed good principles protect private property, help farmers, and stop greed. A government with these principles would work well, even if its leaders are selfish. Taylor thought self-interest was bad only when it hurts others. He wanted a government to keep people's bad sides under control.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to follow the Constitution exactly. He wanted a small government with no extra powers. He thought a big government would be expensive and unfair. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution can be wrong. He wanted to understand the writers' intentions.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution. It says the United States is a group of states, not one country.",
            "The number of people who submitted commuter logs dropped a lot in the third month of the project. This was unpleasant and not easy to understand. One reason might be the cold winter weather in New England. Fewer people ride their bicycles or walk in the cold. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They might not have time to submit commuter logs. The December holiday season is also a time when students and teachers do not need to come to campus. Classes start again in late January. But none of these reasons explains why the number of submissions was low in February. It is possible that a new project always starts with a lot of energy and excitement, but this excitement naturally ends. We had a Carpool Challenge Week in March to try and make the project more interesting again. This helped increase the number of submissions. One problem we faced was how to keep the project going when people are naturally less involved during the holiday and semester breaks. \n\nAnother problem is that many people like driving their cars because it gives them freedom and independence. This is a big part of our culture. To get people to use other ways to travel, we need to give them good reasons to do so. We gave out prizes like gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a new bicycle or car, would have affected the project. This might have helped the project stay strong even when people were less involved. The prizes we gave out did not change much during the project. If we had increased the prizes over time, that might have helped keep people interested. The gift cards were good at the start, but if we had promised bigger prizes in December and January, more people might have been interested and participated in the project.",
            "An ETF is a type of investment. It is like an index fund. But it is more flexible. It trades like a stock on the stock exchange. An ETF gives you the protection of an index fund. It also gives you the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time.\n\nETFs have low costs. They are lower than the costs of the average mutual fund. But ETFs have some problems. You have to pay a fee for trading. This is like paying a fee to buy a stock. There are many types of ETFs available. But it is a good idea to check if the benefits you are promised are real.\n\nWe are looking at one ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is like owning a group of 10 stocks. We also want to see if there is a better way to use these stocks.\n\nIt would be hard to look at all the stocks in the ETF. So we are only looking at the top 10 stocks. These stocks make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and how much of the ETF they make up.\n\nWe want to see if these 10 stocks are a good representation of the ETF. We can use a chart to see if they are similar to the ETF. The chart shows how much each stock contributes to the Beta and Return of the ETF.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means that the portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could provide a higher return with less risk.\n\nBut we need to be sure that this is not just a chance. We need to check if the difference is real. We will look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. This will help us understand how much risk each stock has. We will then compare the total risk of the 10 stocks to the risk of the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land\". One of his better poems, Poe said. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" twice. This word comes from the Latin poet Virgil. Virgil used it to describe a place north of Britain that the ancient Greeks considered the end of the world.\n\nThere is another source for the word \"Thulé\". Poe liked the writing of German authors. He was influenced by a famous writer named Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". This play was first published in 1808 and later in 1832, the year Goethe died. \"Faust\" is a story about a man who makes a deal with the devil.\n\nIn \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". This poem is about a king who loses his wife and then becomes very sad. He drinks a lot and cries. Eventually, he decides to die. The king's story is similar to the main character's story in \"Dream-Land\". This similarity may show that Poe was thinking of Goethe's story when he wrote \"Dream-Land\".\n\nGoethe's \"Faust\" was also made into a play by another writer in 1842. This play was published just a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in another one of his poems called \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land\", at the beginning and end of the poem. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a dark and lonely place called Thulé. This place is a world without color and is haunted by the speaker's dead friends.\n\nPoe was familiar with Goethe's work. He admired the work of another famous writer named Tennyson. Poe said he respected Tennyson. Poe would have also known Goethe's work because many copies of his books were published after the original. This means that many people could read Goethe's work, including Poe.",
            "Can a customer who hurt herself after slipping and falling on applesauce in a grocery store get money from the store because the manager acted very badly? The manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge will not quickly say no to Jennifer Palmer's claim for extra money. To get extra money, Jennifer must show that the manager acted on purpose to cause harm. She must also show that his actions were very bad. Jennifer can say that Martin should have known the spill was a problem because many customers had slipped on the floor before and got hurt. Martin still did not clean up the spill, even knowing this.\n\nJennifer can argue that Martin acted very badly because six people slipped and fell in the store in 2009, but he did not do anything to make the store safe. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J.

Five people had slipped and fallen in the store in the same year.\n\nJennifer is suing D&D Markets for money for her injury. We want to know if we should ask the court to stop Jennifer from getting extra money.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means the person wanted to cause harm, or the person did something very bad and did not care about the other person.

            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics we discussed was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is more important now than ever.  Since 9/11, I have seen the media's view of Islam change from very negative to very positive.  I do not think it was possible in 2001 for a presidential candidate to be named Barack Obama, who has Muslim family members.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  According to what I know, his history does not match his personality.  I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslims.  He would conquer tribes and make them become Muslims.  But in the biography, Muhammad is written as a kind and humble man.  People came to see the truth in his teaching on their own.\n\nThere are some similarities between Jesus and Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food for forty men.  I think this writing style makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything.  This is a problem because it downplays the life of Jesus.  It is like they are taking credit for Jesus' life. \n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem like the authors want to show how people became Muslims on their own.  But these stories are often from people who heard from others.  I do not like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad a kind and gentle man.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and what he believed during his life were not kept after his death. Instead, the development of Christian thought moved forward. If we look at Christian history, we see a pattern of moving away from the beginning. Today, many people are becoming more aware and moving forward in a new way. Traditional people want to keep things the same. They will not want to change. But they may not have enough power to stop the change. In the future, many Christians will want to know more about the history of their religion. They will try to understand the original ideas of Jesus and the ideas that people added later. It may take a long time, but eventually, this will happen. The result will be a change in Christian history. People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus. They will remove the ideas that were added later. It will be like the clock moving backward. When this happens, the church will remain strong. The church will help people understand and follow the original ideas of Jesus. As a result, there will be less difference between people and groups of people. There will be more agreement in what they believe and do. \n\nWe have seen this happen before in history. The Roman Empire used to persecute Christians. But later, it became a Christian empire. Our country used to treat African-Americans badly. But now they have leadership positions.\n\nTo make this change possible, people need to understand that Jesus' words can be used as examples, not as facts. If we look back at the beginning of Christianity, we see that it started with Judaism. Christians believe in one god and the authority of the Jewish scriptures. But the Jewish people did not agree on one idea. They had different groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people deep down are often selfish and only think about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One example is the factory owners. They only want to make their factories bigger and more successful. They do not care about anything that gets in their way. According to the author, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky.\" He is showing the big damage from pollution. The owners do not care about people or animals that get hurt. They do not care about the big clouds of smoke from the factories or the bad water from the animal pens.\n\nThe factory owners also do not care about their workers. They want to make a lot of money, so they make their workers work long hours. They can lay off many workers at a time without giving them any help. During the time the story is set, there were no laws to protect workers. This allowed the owners to be cruel to their workers. The workers had to work in bad conditions and live in bad places. There were no groups to help them. Some unions were formed, but they often made money from the workers. The workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape. They were like slaves. This is why the author says immorality is very common in this situation.\n\nThe Jungle shows that people in power do not care about others. They only care about themselves and making their lives better. They do not think about the people who are suffering.",
            "Some writers try to make readers feel a certain way about important things. They use different techniques to do this. Some techniques work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a good example. He uses many of these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby.\n\nFitzgerald uses a special way to make readers feel something about a subject. He pairs two words together that are not usually together. This is called a combination. He also uses a symbol and gives it a special meaning. Then he uses that symbol again to make readers feel something.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with colors. He gives each color a special meaning. He uses these colors to make readers feel something about important things. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses the colors white and gray. He wants readers to think of these colors when they think of certain people or things.\n\nFitzgerald says that white and gray are the same, but with a difference. White is better and more important. Gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald shows this in the beginning of the book. Many characters wear white clothes. Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Other characters wear white too. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick talks about Gatsby's party. Nick says the party is colorful.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors with many other things. He uses white and gray to describe unimportant things. He makes readers think that these colors are not exciting. He uses these colors to describe Daisy too. He makes readers see Daisy as just a character, not as a person. Fitzgerald wants readers to think that Daisy is not special.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to make readers feel something about important things. He gives them a special meaning and then uses them again to make readers feel something. This is how he makes readers see things in a certain way.",
            "San Diego County is a very good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many common crops grow there, like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits such as peaches and lemons. Some people also grow berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big market for food from organic farms. Many people in the area want to buy this type of food. Some farms offer tours and allow people to hike and watch birds.\n\nOrganic farms have many benefits. They help keep the soil and water clean. This makes the area have more plants and animals. But organic farming can be more expensive. It needs more work and management to remove pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without using chemicals. It also has bigger losses than farming with chemicals. A small organic farm is not as efficient as a big farm.\n\nThe land for this example is 160 acres in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero. It has chaparral, grass and oak trees. It is in the Cleveland National Forest. Many plants and animals live there, including some that are endangered. These include the kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and some kinds of butterflies. Some animals are getting fewer in number and may become endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nPeople lived on this land a long time ago. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers lived there. The land was used for grazing and making wood. Now, a small farmer wants to grow food and take care of the wildlife. The farmer looks at government programs to get help and save money. The farmer also looks at a nearby organic farm to see what they do.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiations. But culture can be difficult to understand. It is not one thing. It is many things. Many people think all people from a certain country are the same. But they are not. For example, not all Russians are stubborn, and not all Japanese are polite. These ideas are too simple.\n\nWhen we meet people from another culture, we compare them to people from our own culture. This can cause problems. Instead of trying to understand another culture, we should try to accept it. We should work within its rules. This is especially important in negotiations. If we come to the table with a weak position, we need to respect the other culture.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. A company may work long hours or have a relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in its dress code, how people talk, and who they hire. Different companies have different cultures. Even in the same country, companies can be very different.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important. Values tell us why people behave in certain ways. If people value saving face, they will not do something that might look bad. If people value settling a deal quickly, they will not wait for a better offer. To be a good negotiator, we need to understand these values.\n\nBefore a negotiation, we should learn about the other person's culture and values. This will help us to succeed. But we should also try to learn about our opponent on a personal level. This will make the negotiation more effective.",

If we said they were talking about a different kind of God, we could not compare their ideas.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea. He says God exists because we can think about him.

St. Thomas says there are five good reasons for believing in God. He says:\n\n1. Change happens. This means something has a cause.\n2. We need someone to cause things to happen.\n3. Some things are not necessary. This means they have a purpose.\n4. There are different levels of good and bad.\n5. The world has order.\n\nSt. Thomas says these reasons prove God exists.",

Many people participate in this ceremony. It has meaning for the people who follow this way.\n\nBuddhism has changed over time. This happened from the inside and the outside.

The inside change is called internal. An internal force is something that comes from Buddhists. An external force is something that comes from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A hostile force is something that hurts Buddhism. A benign force is something that does not want to hurt or help Buddhism.\n\nNow, let's look at the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists want to be safe from suffering. They want to be safe from the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. Buddhists also want to be safe from three things: desire, hatred, and confusion. These three things cause suffering.\n\nBuddhists believe in three things that give them safety. They are the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha taught many things, but some of the most important are: there is no soul, life is suffering, and everything is not permanent. When people understand these things, they can escape the cycle of death and rebirth.\n\nBuddhists follow rules to live a good life. There are five rules for ordinary people. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145) This rivalry was very strong. The United States and Mexico fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The Americans won the war and took Texas and the American Southwest. \n\nMany problems happened between the two countries. They disagreed on important issues like religion, culture, and tradition. They also had different material interests. This is like other countries that have a long rivalry with a neighboring country. When countries share a border, they often disagree on things.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not alone in having a long rivalry. Other countries with borders also have disagreements. David M. Pletcher (1977) said that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find serious problems for the United States. Both of these countries are close to the United States and have been rivals.\n\nThe two countries disagreed on religious issues. This has been a problem for many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) said that Americans were against Catholicism and monarchy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The United States and Mexico had a similar problem, but it was about their different ways of thinking about God. This distrust came from the way the English and Spanish treated each other. The English and Spanish had a lot of distrust, and this was passed down to the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 disagreements between the United States and Mexico during the 57 years of their rivalry. Most of these disagreements were about land and people crossing the border. There were many problems with bandits and outlaws from one country coming into the other. This was a serious problem until the United States and Mexico used their military to control their borders.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries began to end as Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States also changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically. This change happened in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I got very sick. I did not know I could get this sickness. \n\nI was working as a nurse at that time. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. But as a child, I did not have a safe and secure life. I was told, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nEven so, at 46 years old, I was not working. I had no money and I could not work. To this day, I am still sick and I have been getting a small amount of money from the government for 15 years. I have nothing now. Every day is hard for me. I depend on my family and friends to help me.\n\nI know that life is hard. Sometimes big problems come and we cannot solve them alone. I agree that we should not rely on the government to solve all our problems. But we should help each other. We should be friendly and help our neighbors too.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism is good, but it is not the truth. Our ancestors who came to America did not cross the country alone. They worked together and helped each other.\n\nI am prepared for hard times. I have a kit with food, water, and other things I need in case of an emergency. But it is also important to know your neighbors and help each other.",
            "We want to know why living things change over time. What rules are they following? Although a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said in 1917 that we do not know much about how simple living things are made, this is still true today. Recently, people are using math to learn about how mollusks, like clams, make their shells. Our study is trying to use math and experiments to understand why and how living things change.\n\nWe are studying a kind of shellfish called Prunum. We took pictures of Prunum shells using special X-rays. We used these pictures to make numbers that we can use in a computer program to make pictures of what Prunum shells might look like. These pictures can help us understand what shells can look like.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It turns as it grows, like a spiral staircase. This staircase has lines that separate each turn, called sutures. The last turn is the biggest. The part of the shell above the last turn is called the spire. The small end of the spire is called the apex. The other end is called the base. The animal lives in the shell through a small opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. One way is from the top, one way is from the bottom, and one way is from the side. The usual way to look at a shell is from the side, with the opening toward us.\n\nTo count the turns of the shell, we look at it from the top and find the first line that separates two turns. We draw a line from this point to divide the shell into two parts. Then, we count the turns from this line. We can also count the size of the turns.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal makes as it grows its shell. We can use math to find this path and understand how the shell grows. We can change the math to see how the shell would grow if it were different.",
            "The health of babies and young children in Indonesia is a big problem.  For the last ten years, it has not improved very much.  Indonesia is on track to meet some of the goals set by the United Nations, but it is not making progress in improving the health of women and children.  The reasons for this are many and need to be discussed.\n\nIn Indonesia, more and more babies are being born with a doctor or nurse present, which is good.  But many of these workers are not doctors and cannot help if there are problems during delivery.  This means that many women are still dying from complications during pregnancy.  The number of children with diarrhea who see a doctor is also decreasing.  We do not have much information about how well new mothers are being cared for after they give birth.\n\nFewer babies are being born by surgery, which is good.  But this is mostly happening in cities, not in rural areas.  This shows that people in the country are not having the same access to healthcare services as people in the cities.  The poor are having a hard time getting the healthcare they need, probably because they cannot afford it.\n\nSo the question now is: how can Indonesia make healthcare better for babies and mothers?  The biggest question is: should Indonesia create special programs to solve these problems or strengthen the whole healthcare system?  One way to solve the problems is to give extra help to one area, like prenatal care or after-birth care for the mother and baby.  This can be effective, but it also has some problems.  One problem is that it can take money away from other important areas of healthcare.  This can cause people who work in healthcare to focus on the area with the most money and resources.  Also, having too many programs can cause confusion and waste.",
            "Two Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the rich people of that time. But two novels that are not like others from this period are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels have surprising and strange parts that help us understand the characters' thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the main character, Oliver, has strange thoughts and sees strange things. He hears two men arguing, Sikes and Crackit. They are loud and angry. Oliver is scared and confused. He sees and hears many strange things: loud noises, flashing lights, and people shouting. He feels a lot of pain.\n\nThe author uses strange events to show what is going on in Oliver's mind. These events often happen in his dreams or when he is feeling strange. When Oliver is shot, he relives the experience in his mind. He feels very scared and powerless. He does not have control over what happens to him.\n\nThe passage shows that Oliver has no control over his life. He is in a bad situation and cannot change it. This makes him feel defeated. He accepts his situation and cannot fight back.\n\nIn another novel, Wuthering Heights, the day is very long and very short. The sun does not shine. It is night and it is day at the same time. The silence is very scary and the time is very short.",
            "I worked with students at an after-school program a couple of years ago. I was a tutor for younger students, and my strengths were in English and reading. The program's instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. At first, I thought something was wrong with him. Some letters he could read, but others not at all. It was strange. He spoke perfect English, but I thought maybe he was from a Spanish-speaking family. I tried to help him, but it was hard. Then, his mother came to visit. She only spoke Spanish. We used simple words, and I used what little Spanish I knew. I then understood his problem: he knew English, but he didn't know the alphabet well. I don't know if he got better, but I hope he did.\n\nI tell this story to show the problem of language barriers in schools. Even if students speak perfect English, they can still struggle to read. This is a big problem in California. Everyone agrees it's a problem, but what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: more practice with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for other students who barely speak English, the answer is not clear. We need a combination of things: dual language systems, mainstream classes, private tutors, and English as a second language (ESL) classes.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps students who speak other languages and all students. Students in these programs do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it's not worth the money and that most students won't benefit. But that's not true. If we make these programs a part of our schools, all students will benefit. So, how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's not realistic. But we can have special helpers who understand two languages.",
            "Most people are told from a young age that there is something bigger than themselves. This can be in school, at church or home. Some people accept what they are taught, but others do not believe in a higher power. They think the world is just our own special place. We try to find our own way and make decisions about what we believe in.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. He said so when I asked him. We sat on our porch during the rain. The rain made the plants on the edge of the porch wet. My father looked at the rain, lost in thought. He had lost weight and his hair was thinning. He avoided looking at me. I was sad and didn't want to talk about how I would miss him. I hugged him, sat back down and looked at the rain with him.\n\nMy father died in December when I was 22. He had cancer. The doctors gave him medicine to make him feel a little better, but it didn't help much. I did not want to see him die. I wanted to remember him when he was alive. I wanted to remember him for who he was, not how he died. I knew my father better than anyone. I knew he would not want me to watch him die. I sat in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNobody called me to tell me the news.",
            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what Ian Watt calls it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" Many people have looked down on the Gothic style, but others have praised it for its exciting and frightening parts. The original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by Horace Walpole, combines old and new ideas to create a new way of writing. Walpole uses old theatrical elements and new ways of writing to create a \"Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic style uses many ideas from the past, like medieval theatre, buildings, and traditions. Even when Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"Gothic\" meant many different things. People thought it was old-fashioned and unsophisticated. The combination of old and new ideas makes the Gothic style last a long time and become new again to readers who are far from the original time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It is a medieval idea that is both kept and changed in the original Gothic novel. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it shows what a good knight should be like: brave, honorable, and able. Gothic writers saw that their society did not have these qualities. They used chivalry in their writing to make the past seem better and to try to improve the present.\n\nHorace Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were not going well in his country. He was unhappy about the future. He might have thought that people in the past were better than people in his time. This is seen in the character of Frederic. Before we meet him, we know he has many chivalric qualities. He is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be dead. He is described as a gallant and courteous knight, which is an exaggeration. This shows the Gothic idea of excess.\n\nThe Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what makes it last a long time and become new again to readers who are far from the original time. The Gothic style uses many ideas from the past and combines them with new ways of writing to create a new way of telling stories.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of getting goods from the customer to the customer. It includes the stages of getting raw materials, making the product, and delivering it to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He said that supply chain management is planning, doing, and controlling all the things that happen to get the product to the customer quickly and efficiently. There are six important parts of a supply chain: making the product, getting the materials, keeping a stock of products, where the products are made, how the products are moved, and getting information about the products.\n\nThe first step in supply chain management is making the product. This is the start of the whole process. Making the product includes deciding when, why, where, and how to make it. Business managers need to know what the customers want. They can find out by looking at the market. The market shows them what the customers want and need. Once the managers know what the customers want, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory is best for making them, based on the customer's needs.\n\nThe next step is to schedule work and take care of the machines. After that, the managers focus on getting the products to the customers. This is a very important part of the supply chain process. Every small detail is important, and if it is not planned well, it can cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run.\n\nFor example, at a big retail store like Wal-Mart or Target, there are special plans and rules for every part of the business. There is a plan for how the employees should look, how the products should be received from the trucks, and how the store should be run. This helps the company to work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is getting the materials and products. This includes deciding what the company can do itself and what it should get from other companies. A company may have many different parts that make a single product. The manager must decide which part is best for each step of making the product. The manager may also decide to work with other companies to make the product. The main reason for working with other companies is to make the product quickly and at a low cost.",
            "People say Hitler is alive in a country called Burma.\n\nEllen Page, who is a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner with a sign above her head. The sign says something that makes people think. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of men with guns rule the country. They took power in 1962. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. The protests were the first in ten years. Many monks were leading the protests. The monks wear yellow robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution.\n\nAt first, the people in charge of the country let the monks hold meetings. But soon the government got angry and started to fight back. They hurt many people and destroyed many buildings. Journalists from other countries were arrested and imprisoned. A Japanese journalist was killed while he was covering the protests. The government said 13 people were killed, but a man who used to be in the army said many more people were killed.\n\nThis is not new. Many years ago, rulers wanted to have complete control over their people. Roman emperors said they had the right to make all the decisions. In Japan, the emperors are believed to be gods. They say they were sent to help people.\n\nIn the United States, the president has meetings with a man who leads a group called the Republican Party. Some examples of people being hurt by their rulers are the protests in China in 1989. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed, but others said 2,000-3,000 people were killed. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their skin color. The Nazis in Germany also hurt many people because of their skin color.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous musician. He made many great jazz pieces because he lived a long time and could keep creating new music. He often played the piano in his songs, but he was also a great composer. Ellington made music that showed off the special talents of each musician in his band. He created a framework where soloists could play freely and also wrote tightly organized parts that used each musician's style.\n\nEllington was a master at making the orchestra sound great together. He wrote music that was original and fit well with each piece. He knew how to use the sound of each musician and how they worked together to create new and exciting music.\n\nOne example of Ellington's work is the song \"Creole Love Call.\" It is a slow blues song with a call and response between voice and other instruments. The song starts with a smooth, melodic voice, then becomes rougher at the end. This shows Ellington's ability to mix different sounds and styles.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" the music is divided into six parts. Each part is different, but they all fit together well. The song has a muted trumpet solo that adds to the melody. A clarinet solo is also important, with a piano that plays a subtle, syncopated rhythm. The final part of the song returns to the call and response between voice and instruments.\n\nEllington's use of voice in his music is an important part of his style. In \"Creole Love Call,\" the voice is used like an instrument to add different colors and textures to the music. This is one way Ellington made his music special.\n\nIn another song, \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington uses his skill at organizing music and his ability to hear different sounds to create a rich and interesting sound. The song has a call and response between a trumpet player and a singer, creating a unique and complementary sound. Ellington also uses a trombone player to introduce a melody.\n\nEllington's music is full of new and exciting ideas. He was a master of using the sounds of each musician and making them work together to create something special. His music is still popular today and is considered some of the best jazz ever written.",

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" affects the risk of heart disease and stroke. The Mediterranean Diet is a healthy way of eating that includes many plant foods, a little fish, and some nuts. It has more monounsaturated fats and less saturated fats.\n\nSome past studies showed that people who followed the Mediterranean Diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems. This new study wanted to know about stroke.\n\nResearchers looked at 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63. They asked these women about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. The women also reported about their health, including if they had any heart problems.\n\nThe researchers found that women who ate a lot of Mediterranean diet foods were less likely to have heart disease and stroke. They also found that these women were less likely to die from heart disease and stroke. The researchers used a special score to measure how well the women followed the Mediterranean Diet.\n\nTo make the study more accurate, the researchers averaged the scores from the past two years to get a better idea of each woman's eating habits. They also controlled for factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of Mediterranean diet foods were 29% less likely to have heart disease and stroke than women who did not follow the diet as well. This study shows that eating a healthy Mediterranean Diet can help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
            "In two thousand seven, the United States had a serious financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market got worse. The economy was in trouble, and many large businesses were in bad shape. This problem is still happening today. We need to ask, how did this happen and how can we stop it?\n\nThe financial problem was caused by bad decisions made by politicians. They wanted banks to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was because the country wanted to help people who did not have enough money. But the banks did not have enough money to cover these loans. They sold these bad loans to other companies, and the problem spread.\n\nThe companies that sold these bad loans were called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They took these bad loans and made new investments called CDOs and CDSs. When people could not pay back the loans, the banks did not have enough money. The banks then gave the problem to the other companies that had bought the bad loans. This caused a big problem in the economy.\n\nThis problem started in nineteen ninety-nine. The President at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to be re-elected. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans. This made it easier for people to buy houses, but it also made the banks give out bad loans. A reporter named Steve Holmes wrote about this problem in nineteen ninety-nine. He said, \"Fannie Mae is giving out too many loans to people who cannot pay them back. This could cause big problems in the future.\"\n\nIndeed, many things worked together to make the economy worse. Banks gave out new kinds of loans that were hard to understand. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages and CDOs. They made the economy more connected to the housing market. This made people and banks borrow too much money, and they were not prepared for when the housing market went down.\n\nWhen the housing market went down, many banks had trouble. They had borrowed too much money and could not pay it back. The big banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This is a lot of money. In the end, some banks went out of business. The government had to take control of Fannie and Freddie, which had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans.",
            "Many writers know about exposition.  It's the part of a story where you tell the reader a lot of information at once.  This can make the reader bored or want to stop reading.  Dr. Merlin says that exposition is not your friend.\n\nYou already know the tip \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes this mistake.  Exposition is like a little devil that says to get the background out of the way so you can get to the good parts.\n\nExposition means saying what happened.  It's like a character telling another character a lot of information at once.  In fiction, the author does the telling.\n\nFor example, you read a story and are told that a woman met her husband at a certain time and place.  You're also told that he was murdered in front of her.  You would not expect this to take two pages, with not much happening during that time.  You would want to know more about the husband's character, how he loved his wife, and how she felt about him.  This would make you care about them and their story.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would give you more information about the heroine too.  You would understand why she loved him and how his death affected her.  You would be sad when he dies and care more about the heroine.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add more to the story.  It's easy to rush past some parts, but you should not.  You might introduce a new character and want to tell the reader a lot about him at once.  But you should not do this.  Instead, show the reader more about the character as the story goes on.\n\nFor example, you might tell the reader that a man used to be in the Air Force, is now a gas station manager, and has two ex-wives.  But you should not say he likes to fish on the weekends and dreams of owning the gas station.  Show this by what he says and does in the story.",

The police are searching for the person who did this. This story was short. I think it might be because the police are still looking for the person who did it.\n\nI noticed something.

            "The brain is a very complex system that helps us think and learn. As technology has improved, people have used different ways to compare the brain to other things. At first, it was compared to a piece of wax, then to paper, then to a book, and now to a computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons are not very good and can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain starts to process information when it receives signals from our senses. These signals come from things like touch, heat, sound, or light. The brain changes this information into signals that can be understood. It does this in two ways: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together simple information like color and shape to decide it's a box. Top-down processing helps you recognize the box faster by using the decisions made earlier.\n\nThe brain decides what information is important and what to do with it. For instance, when you look down at your shoes, you don't notice every blade of grass, but you might hear your name in a noisy room. There are many steps in the way the brain processes information, and attention helps at each step.\n\nFor the brain to work, it needs to store information. There are different types of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain stores information in a special way. For example, when we hear words, the brain stores them in different ways, such as how they look, sound, or mean. When information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies show that working memory, which lasts about 20 seconds, is kept by a signal moving through some brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some are based on how people remember things, others are based on computers, and others are based on how the brain works. One idea, the semantic network, says that there are nodes representing ideas, and that the nodes are connected based on how they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which can be connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",

He creates a world where people value their community above themselves and pursue happiness above all else. The people in this world are conditioned to obey one ideology and do not think for themselves. This is a commentary on the problems of the capitalist system.\n\nHuxley uses Marxist ideas to show his concerns about capitalism. He talks about how people are kept from knowing the truth about their place in society. This is called false consciousness. People are interested in their own gain and do not see the problems of the system. The World Controller controls the people and makes them think they are happy when they are really not.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are conditioned to want things they do not need. They are taught to spend and indulge. The different classes in society, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own thoughts. They are controlled by the World Controller. The upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are also controlled but do not do much to change the system.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have deep relationships. The characters are not very different from each other. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist in this world. People talk about each other's bodies and not about their feelings.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are very happy with their place in society. They do not try to change the system. This is like the Marxist idea of the proletariat, who are told they are better than others if they obey the rules. But Huxley is saying that this is not true.\n\nHuxley's ideas in Brave New World are a warning about the dangers of capitalism and technology. He wants people to think about the problems of the system and not just follow the rules.",
            "I am a student at University Park. It has been two and a half years since I came here. Getting around campus can be hard. My first year I lived in a dorm called East Halls. It is on the east side of campus. My classes were in the Willard building, near the center of campus. It took 25 minutes to walk to class. Sometimes it took longer because of the weather.\n\nThe East Halls dorms used to be far from the rest of the campus. Now it is not so far. New buildings and apartments have been added to the area. The campus is getting bigger. It is harder to get from one place to another.\n\nA good way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But bicycles alone are not enough. Students need to ride them and the campus needs to be built for people who ride bikes.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said that riding a bike is a great way to get around. It is good for the body and it is fast. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. I ride my bike to class every day. The ride is 25 minutes on foot, but 5 minutes on a bike. The road I ride on is not easy to travel. But I have no choice. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking would take too long. It would take over 2 hours every week. I do not have that much time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I want to help people who are in trouble. I want to improve my skills to be a good social worker.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I was not sure which job to choose. In school, I saw people who were afraid to face their problems. I saw people who used bad ways to deal with their problems. I studied psychology to help people. After I finished college in 2009, I took a break. One day, a friend showed me a 16-year-old boy who was very nervous. His parents were hurting him. The next day, the boy called the police. I drove to his house to help. I told the police I was a psychology graduate. They asked me to talk to the parents. I asked them questions. They said their son was being manipulative. I realized I wanted to help children in this situation.\n\nSocial justice is also very important to me. Our society says the individual is special, but we often want to be like everyone else. I am different and I do not want to be like others. In school, I spoke out against unfairness: I colored my hair, wore what I wanted, and stood up against racism and discrimination.

            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep disorder: the biological model and the sociocultural model. The biological model looks at genetic information and medical health. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects sleep. We will explain these models and discuss the research that supports them.\n\nA sleep disorder is a problem with sleeping. It can be a main problem or a problem related to another health issue. There are two main types of sleep disorders: primary sleep disorders and sleep disorders related to mental health. Primary sleep disorders include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and breathing sleep disorder. Insomnia is a problem with sleeping at night, hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake, and narcolepsy is a problem with falling asleep suddenly. \n\nThe biological model of sleep focuses on genes and the body's physical parts that control sleep. Scientists have found that special cells in the brain called orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. They tested this idea on mice and found that special receptors on these cells help control sleep. If these receptors are not working correctly, it can cause problems with sleep. This shows that genetics and the body can affect sleep. This means that if someone has a problem with these receptors, they may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the environment and our surroundings affect sleep. This can include things like our culture, family, and income level. People from different cultures may have different sleep patterns. For example, some cultures sleep a lot during the day and are awake at night. This can affect how well they do in school or at work. If someone's environment is not good for sleep, it can cause problems with sleep.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). We will explain three main parts. First, we will define CAPD. Next, we will explain how doctors diagnose the disorder. Finally, we will talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. The brain cannot properly understand sounds. People with CAPD can hear normally. They do not have trouble hearing. But their brain has trouble understanding what they hear. It is like when you hear many noises and have trouble understanding what someone is saying.\n\nThe first mention of CAPD was in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children who had trouble communicating. They developed tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, another researcher introduced a way to test how the brain uses sound information. A big conference in 1977 helped researchers learn more about CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may have trouble understanding two or more sounds at the same time. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may not be able to tell if someone is being serious or joking. One sound can cover up another sound. They may not be able to understand how to use sound clues. And they may not be able to understand how sounds come in order.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors use different methods. They watch the patient's behavior and perform tests on their hearing. Doctors may use questionnaires and surveys, or watch how the patient responds to different sounds. There is no one test that works for everyone. There is no known reason why CAPD happens. Tests may present many sounds at the same time and ask the patient to choose the right one.\n\nIn a regular classroom, a teacher can help a student with CAPD. The teacher can provide extra help with listening and following directions. The teacher can also use visual aids to help the student understand what is being said. For example, the teacher can write down what they are saying. This can help the student understand better. The teacher can also seat the student in a quiet area of the classroom to help them focus.",
            "This play says that wearing a disguise can help us trick people, but it can also cause problems. A big problem is that we may hurt our relationships with others when the truth comes out. \n\nIn the play Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola wears a man's clothes to protect herself. She pretends to be a man so that she is safe. But this trick makes her lose touch with her friends. She also has to deal with romantic feelings she has for a man and a woman. \n\nViola is good at pretending to be a man. But she also causes a problem for the man she loves and the woman who loves him. The woman thinks Viola is actually a man named Sebastian. \n\nThis play is like a mirror for the characters. It shows their true feelings. The woman who loves the man and the man who loves the woman both have secret feelings. They don't know what they really want. \n\nBut does this mean that the woman really likes women too? The play doesn't say. It's like the woman is making fun of people who judge others based on how they look. \n\nIn the end, Viola is not a man anymore. The truth comes out, and she is no longer a trick. But she has hurt her friends and caused problems. This is a big problem with wearing a disguise. It can hurt the people we love.",
            "German rule in Africa was very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. But this is not the full story of the German colonial rule. The rule was different in different places and the treatment of people was not the same everywhere. \n\nIn German East Africa, the British found many Africans who could read and write when they took control in 1919. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. People wrote about these good things at the time.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa, now called Namibia, was very different. The government did not make many schools for Africans like they did in East Africa. Instead, some missionary groups helped with education, but they did not get much help from the government. The government did make schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools more. This made a big difference in South West Africa. While many Africans in other colonies were able to read and write, most people in South West Africa were not educated. \n\nThere are many books about education in the German colonies. Most of these books were written in German and were written a long time ago. They just told about the schools in the colonies. Later, more books were written in English. They compared the schools in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. One important book looked at the schools in South West Africa and East Africa. The author said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was a big reason for the difference in the education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land is hot desert. Many white people lived in South West Africa because of the good climate. By 1913, there were 15,000 white people living there. In contrast, only 5,336 white people lived in East Africa.",
            "Popular music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over the last 100 years. There are many different kinds of music, and it is hard to make a complete list. Most music styles have smaller groups inside them. For example, rock music has many small groups like metal, jazz, and folk. The metal music group is one of the most interesting and expressive music styles in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it shows a wide range of feelings, mostly the sad or scary kinds. It is diverse because people started to make their own kinds of metal music after it began. This started a chain of smaller groups and smaller groups inside those groups.\n\nToday, it is hard to say what metal music really is. It has taken ideas from other music styles, but it came from somewhere. To understand modern metal music, we need to know what metal music is and why it is a movement.\n\nMetal music is often about darkness. It is often louder and more violent than other music. Metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments. The music is different from other music because it is not simple. It is a movement that was influenced by drug use in the 1970s. People used drugs to create new and crazy sounds. Metal music has many qualities that are not found in other music, like feelings of sadness and fear. Later metal musicians took some of these qualities from the Romantic Era. Some examples of metal music show the darker side of emotions. For example, the Beatles wrote a song called Helter Skelter. It shows the ups and downs of life, like the effects of drugs. This song is often called one of the first metal songs. The Beatles wanted to show that they could be as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a painter in the early nineteen hundreds. He dreamed of making beautiful pictures that people would love. He wanted to be known and respected by other artists and art lovers. His famous painting \"The Dream\" is like a picture of his own dreams and goals. But he had a big problem. He wanted to make his own kind of art, not like other famous painters. He wanted to be unique.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know a little bit about his life. He was born in a town in northwest France in eighteen forty-four. His father was a maker of metal things and a seller. He was a happy man with a good life. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for many years doing a job for the city. When he was forty, he started painting. He wanted to make art to make himself feel better after a sad time in his life.\n\nMany other artists were making good art at the same time as Rousseau. He was not famous until a long time after he started painting. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not want to copy others. He wanted to make his own kind of art. The author Jan Gordon said that Rousseau wanted to make art that was simple, so people would like it. On the other hand, a famous artist named Matisse wanted to make art that was new and different.\n\nRousseau was a folk painter. He made pictures that everyday people could understand. He was not like other artists who made pictures of peasants and made them look beautiful. Rousseau's pictures were like the people who lived in his town.\n\nHis main problem was that he wanted to be accepted by the art world. He wanted to be like other famous artists, but he did not want to copy them. He wanted to be different.",
            "Many people think there is a close connection between right and wrong and what is beautiful. I believe there is a reason for this. The famous writer John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through school or experience. But we like what is right and what is beautiful without being taught. Both right and beautiful are ways to describe, not to tell us what to do. We try to understand why something is good or beautiful, but we can't fully explain it. \n\nFor example, people may talk about the painting Mona Lisa by da Vinci. They may say it has good background, contrast, and setting. But these do not explain why it is great art. When we talk about something we like, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This \"something\" is hard to explain. I think right and beautiful have this same \"something.\" The writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We can describe a story or its qualities, but there is still something more. I think right and good have this same quality. \n\nEthics and aesthetics, or right and beautiful, are closely connected because we experience them in the same way. We can feel them, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is stronger in literature. The writer McKean said, \"Literature is unique because of its moral quality.\" Literature is important to us because it shows us values. We use values in life, and literature helps us understand them.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is a united country with a special culture. This culture comes from many different parts of Germany. People in Germany live near mountains and rivers like the Rhine. They live in cities like Munich, Kiel, and Dresden.\n\nGermany has a long history. It comes from several different tribes and groups. The word 'Germany' comes from many different sources. Some people think it comes from a group of people called the Tungrians. They lived in the area before the river Rhine.\n\nThe Roman writer Julius Caesar first used the word 'German' in his book about the Gauls. He used it to talk about the people he fought against. He read this word from the Gauls themselves. They used it to talk about their neighbors.\n\nJulius Caesar wrote that the Germans lived beyond the river Rhine. They were at war with the Gauls all the time. The Gauls and Germans fought each other every day. \n\nSome people think the word 'German' comes from a spear called a 'ger'. This is a type of spear that people used in battles. Others think it comes from a word in the Old Irish language. This word means 'to shout'. It might mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus wrote a book about the Germans in AD 98. He said that the Germans were an old group of people. They did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild place with bad weather and strong people.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germany. They went to Germany to get things and to fight. They would come back to their big empire. The Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and worked for the Romans.",
            "I looked down at the view in front of me.  I was not thinking about it.  My mind was a blank.  I was studying it, but I was not thinking about it.  I was just looking.\n\nI wanted to learn to draw when I was six years old.  An artist I worked with told me to buy a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  The book teaches you how to draw.  It teaches you how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines.\n\nThe book says to put a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simpler.  I could not do that right then.  I was looking at a bowl of fruit.  I was amazed.\n\nMany famous artists saw the world differently.  Picasso liked blue.  Monet liked green.  I thought my picture could be like theirs.  I looked at the bowl and thought it was the start of my picture.\n\nMy hand went to the pencil.  I wanted to draw.  But I had to clean the toilet instead.  There was a brown package in the toilet bowl.  I tried to move it, but it was stuck.  The package was a problem.  I used a mop to try and move it.  But the mop was not working.\n\nI stood back and thought.  Then I used the toilet paper to clean the bowl.  I had to get the package out.  I dipped my hand into the bowl to get it.  It was not easy.",
            "Many young people die in car accidents.  There are several reasons for this.  One reason is that the brains of teenagers are not yet ready to handle the dangers of driving.  Teenagers also do not have much driving experience.  This lack of experience causes many serious accidents, including rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeenagers often drive with their friends, which makes the situation worse.  A study looked at how old the passengers are when accidents happen.  The study found a strong connection between the age of the passenger and the number of accidents.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teenagers by giving them temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and do not allow other teenagers to be passengers.  However, I think these temporary licenses are not enough.  The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that even 18-year-olds are too young to drive without restrictions.  He has done research that shows people under 19-20 years old often want to take risks just for the fun of it.  It makes sense to wait until this tendency to take risks goes away before giving teenagers a regular driver's license.  If we continue to give licenses to young teens, many more people will die in car accidents.\n\nWe can make a law to solve this problem.  Schools can teach driving classes to future drivers.  But no one under 18 can drive a car.  A temporary permit can still be given before a regular license.  And drivers need to practice for a certain number of hours with a grown-up.  The number of hours can be the same as most states already require.  For example, in California, drivers need 6 hours of practice with a grown-up and 50 hours of practice on their own.  A national law would be a good way to keep teenagers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it is a good idea to make driving safer for everyone.",
            "I looked at the movies from the early days of film. I wanted to see the trick films made by Thomas Edison. There were fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make things look real. My study of these films focused on how they worked and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of the trick films from this time period are set inside a theater. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style of filmmaking comes from theater and magic shows.\n\nOne of the things that all the trick films have in common is that they are filmed inside a theater set. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style was very popular at the time and came from theater and magic shows. \n\nIn these films, the actors usually move side-to-side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors come in from one side and move back and forth. They do not move towards or away from the camera.\n\nThe trick films also use long and medium shots. They almost never use close-up shots. This comes from theater and magic shows, where the whole performance is seen at once. In these early films, the actors do not move towards the camera, so close-up shots are not used.\n\nMost trick films from this time are very short. They are usually a minute or less. This is because they are made up of one idea or one action. However, a single \"shot\" can be made up of many parts. This is how the trick films make people disappear or appear. Look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) to see an example of this. If you look closely, you can see where the different parts of the film are joined together to make the illusion work.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of the Republican Party. He was a farmer, but his work and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions. He believed in personal freedom and a limited government.\n\nTaylor thought that the United States was special because it had no old traditions to follow. This gave its leaders the chance to make a perfect system of government. He believed people have basic rights that must not be taken away. If one right is denied, all are lost. These rights must be safe from the government.\n\nTaylor said that in nature, strong people often get what they want. But in a society, this should not happen. He believed a good government must understand the good and bad in people. Taylor thought a government with good principles would be fair, even if its leaders are not.\n\nHe believed good principles protect private property, help farmers, and stop greed. A government with these principles would work well, even if its leaders are selfish. Taylor thought self-interest was bad only when it hurts others. He wanted a government to keep people's bad sides under control.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to follow the Constitution exactly. He wanted a small government with no extra powers. He thought a big government would be expensive and unfair. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution can be wrong. He wanted to understand the writers' intentions.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution. It says the United States is a group of states, not one country.",
            "The number of people who submitted commuter logs dropped a lot in the third month of the project. This was unpleasant and not easy to understand. One reason might be the cold winter weather in New England. Fewer people ride their bicycles or walk in the cold. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They might not have time to submit commuter logs. The December holiday season is also a time when students and teachers do not need to come to campus. Classes start again in late January. But none of these reasons explains why the number of submissions was low in February. It is possible that a new project always starts with a lot of energy and excitement, but this excitement naturally ends. We had a Carpool Challenge Week in March to try and make the project more interesting again. This helped increase the number of submissions. One problem we faced was how to keep the project going when people are naturally less involved during the holiday and semester breaks. \n\nAnother problem is that many people like driving their cars because it gives them freedom and independence. This is a big part of our culture. To get people to use other ways to travel, we need to give them good reasons to do so. We gave out prizes like gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a new bicycle or car, would have affected the project. This might have helped the project stay strong even when people were less involved. The prizes we gave out did not change much during the project. If we had increased the prizes over time, that might have helped keep people interested. The gift cards were good at the start, but if we had promised bigger prizes in December and January, more people might have been interested and participated in the project.",
            "An ETF is a type of investment. It is like an index fund. But it is more flexible. It trades like a stock on the stock exchange. An ETF gives you the protection of an index fund. It also gives you the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time.\n\nETFs have low costs. They are lower than the costs of the average mutual fund. But ETFs have some problems. You have to pay a fee for trading. This is like paying a fee to buy a stock. There are many types of ETFs available. But it is a good idea to check if the benefits you are promised are real.\n\nWe are looking at one ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is like owning a group of 10 stocks. We also want to see if there is a better way to use these stocks.\n\nIt would be hard to look at all the stocks in the ETF. So we are only looking at the top 10 stocks. These stocks make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and how much of the ETF they make up.\n\nWe want to see if these 10 stocks are a good representation of the ETF. We can use a chart to see if they are similar to the ETF. The chart shows how much each stock contributes to the Beta and Return of the ETF.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means that the portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could provide a higher return with less risk.\n\nBut we need to be sure that this is not just a chance. We need to check if the difference is real. We will look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. This will help us understand how much risk each stock has. We will then compare the total risk of the 10 stocks to the risk of the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land\". One of his better poems, Poe said. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" twice. This word comes from the Latin poet Virgil. Virgil used it to describe a place north of Britain that the ancient Greeks considered the end of the world.\n\nThere is another source for the word \"Thulé\". Poe liked the writing of German authors. He was influenced by a famous writer named Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". This play was first published in 1808 and later in 1832, the year Goethe died. \"Faust\" is a story about a man who makes a deal with the devil.\n\nIn \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". This poem is about a king who loses his wife and then becomes very sad. He drinks a lot and cries. Eventually, he decides to die. The king's story is similar to the main character's story in \"Dream-Land\". This similarity may show that Poe was thinking of Goethe's story when he wrote \"Dream-Land\".\n\nGoethe's \"Faust\" was also made into a play by another writer in 1842. This play was published just a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in another one of his poems called \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land\", at the beginning and end of the poem. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a dark and lonely place called Thulé. This place is a world without color and is haunted by the speaker's dead friends.\n\nPoe was familiar with Goethe's work. He admired the work of another famous writer named Tennyson. Poe said he respected Tennyson. Poe would have also known Goethe's work because many copies of his books were published after the original. This means that many people could read Goethe's work, including Poe.",
            "Can a customer who hurt herself after slipping and falling on applesauce in a grocery store get money from the store because the manager acted very badly? The manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge will not quickly say no to Jennifer Palmer's claim for extra money. To get extra money, Jennifer must show that the manager acted on purpose to cause harm. She must also show that his actions were very bad. Jennifer can say that Martin should have known the spill was a problem because many customers had slipped on the floor before and got hurt. Martin still did not clean up the spill, even knowing this.\n\nJennifer can argue that Martin acted very badly because six people slipped and fell in the store in 2009, but he did not do anything to make the store safe. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, told Martin about the spill, and he gave the same answer. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly. Five people had slipped and fallen in the store in the same year.\n\nJennifer is suing D&D Markets for money for her injury. We want to know if we should ask the court to stop Jennifer from getting extra money.\n\nIn California, a person can get extra money if the other person acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means the person wanted to cause harm, or the person did something very bad and did not care about the other person. Courts have said that a person acts with malice when they know something bad will happen and do not try to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics we discussed was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is more important now than ever.  Since 9/11, I have seen the media's view of Islam change from very negative to very positive.  I do not think it was possible in 2001 for a presidential candidate to be named Barack Obama, who has Muslim family members.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  According to what I know, his history does not match his personality.  I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslims.  He would conquer tribes and make them become Muslims.  But in the biography, Muhammad is written as a kind and humble man.  People came to see the truth in his teaching on their own.\n\nThere are some similarities between Jesus and Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food for forty men.  I think this writing style makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything.  This is a problem because it downplays the life of Jesus.  It is like they are taking credit for Jesus' life. \n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem like the authors want to show how people became Muslims on their own.  But these stories are often from people who heard from others.  I do not like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad a kind and gentle man.

If we look at Christian history, we see a pattern of moving away from the beginning. Today, many people are becoming more aware and moving forward in a new way. Traditional people want to keep things the same. They will not want to change. But they may not have enough power to stop the change. In the future, many Christians will want to know more about the history of their religion. They will try to understand the original ideas of Jesus and the ideas that people added later. It may take a long time, but eventually, this will happen. The result will be a change in Christian history. People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus. They will remove the ideas that were added later. It will be like the clock moving backward. When this happens, the church will remain strong. The church will help people understand and follow the original ideas of Jesus. As a result, there will be less difference between people and groups of people. There will be more agreement in what they believe and do. \n\nWe have seen this happen before in history. The Roman Empire used to persecute Christians. But later, it became a Christian empire. Our country used to treat African-Americans badly. But now they have leadership positions.\n\nTo make this change possible, people need to understand that Jesus' words can be used as examples, not as facts. If we look back at the beginning of Christianity, we see that it started with Judaism. Christians believe in one god and the authority of the Jewish scriptures. But the Jewish people did not agree on one idea. They had different groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people deep down are often selfish and only think about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One example is the factory owners. They only want to make their factories bigger and more successful. They do not care about anything that gets in their way. According to the author, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky.\" He is showing the big damage from pollution. The owners do not care about people or animals that get hurt. They do not care about the big clouds of smoke from the factories or the bad water from the animal pens.\n\nThe factory owners also do not care about their workers. They want to make a lot of money, so they make their workers work long hours. They can lay off many workers at a time without giving them any help. During the time the story is set, there were no laws to protect workers. This allowed the owners to be cruel to their workers. The workers had to work in bad conditions and live in bad places. There were no groups to help them. Some unions were formed, but they often made money from the workers. The workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape. They were like slaves. This is why the author says immorality is very common in this situation.\n\nThe Jungle shows that people in power do not care about others. They only care about themselves and making their lives better. They do not think about the people who are suffering.",
            "Some writers try to make readers feel a certain way about important things. They use different techniques to do this. Some techniques work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a good example. He uses many of these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby.\n\nFitzgerald uses a special way to make readers feel something about a subject. He pairs two words together that are not usually together. This is called a combination. He also uses a symbol and gives it a special meaning. Then he uses that symbol again to make readers feel something.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with colors. He gives each color a special meaning. He uses these colors to make readers feel something about important things. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses the colors white and gray. He wants readers to think of these colors when they think of certain people or things.\n\nFitzgerald says that white and gray are the same, but with a difference. White is better and more important. Gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald shows this in the beginning of the book. Many characters wear white clothes. Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Other characters wear white too. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick talks about Gatsby's party. Nick says the party is colorful.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors with many other things. He uses white and gray to describe unimportant things. He makes readers think that these colors are not exciting. He uses these colors to describe Daisy too. He makes readers see Daisy as just a character, not as a person. Fitzgerald wants readers to think that Daisy is not special.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to make readers feel something about important things. He gives them a special meaning and then uses them again to make readers feel something. This is how he makes readers see things in a certain way.",
            "San Diego County is a very good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many common crops grow there, like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits such as peaches and lemons. Some people also grow berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big market for food from organic farms. Many people in the area want to buy this type of food. Some farms offer tours and allow people to hike and watch birds.\n\nOrganic farms have many benefits. They help keep the soil and water clean. This makes the area have more plants and animals. But organic farming can be more expensive. It needs more work and management to remove pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without using chemicals. It also has bigger losses than farming with chemicals. A small organic farm is not as efficient as a big farm.\n\nThe land for this example is 160 acres in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero. It has chaparral, grass and oak trees. It is in the Cleveland National Forest. Many plants and animals live there, including some that are endangered. These include the kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and some kinds of butterflies. Some animals are getting fewer in number and may become endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nPeople lived on this land a long time ago. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers lived there. The land was used for grazing and making wood. Now, a small farmer wants to grow food and take care of the wildlife. The farmer looks at government programs to get help and save money. The farmer also looks at a nearby organic farm to see what they do.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiations. But culture can be difficult to understand. It is not one thing. It is many things. Many people think all people from a certain country are the same. But they are not. For example, not all Russians are stubborn, and not all Japanese are polite. These ideas are too simple.\n\nWhen we meet people from another culture, we compare them to people from our own culture. This can cause problems. Instead of trying to understand another culture, we should try to accept it. We should work within its rules. This is especially important in negotiations. If we come to the table with a weak position, we need to respect the other culture.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. A company may work long hours or have a relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in its dress code, how people talk, and who they hire. Different companies have different cultures. Even in the same country, companies can be very different.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important. Values tell us why people behave in certain ways. If people value saving face, they will not do something that might look bad. If people value settling a deal quickly, they will not wait for a better offer. To be a good negotiator, we need to understand these values.\n\nBefore a negotiation, we should learn about the other person's culture and values. This will help us to succeed. But we should also try to learn about our opponent on a personal level. This will make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The Bible says, “The fool says, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is important to St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both think God exists. We will look at their ideas to see which one is better.\n\nWe will start by assuming they are both right. This is because their ideas are about the God of the Bible. If we said they were talking about a different kind of God, we could not compare their ideas.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea. He says God exists because we can think about him. He says that God is inside our minds. We can understand that God exists without looking outside of ourselves. St. Anselm thinks that faith is enough for us to know God.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can prove God exists with reason and facts. He does not need faith. St. Thomas says there are five good reasons for believing in God. He says:\n\n1. Change happens. This means something has a cause.\n2. We need someone to cause things to happen.\n3. Some things are not necessary. This means they have a purpose.\n4. There are different levels of good and bad.\n5. The world has order.\n\nSt. Thomas says these reasons prove God exists.",
            "Long ago, a prince was born. He would be called Buddha. This happened in the fifth or sixth century before Christ. The prince renounced the world and became a wise man. He taught people the path to happiness. His teachings formed a new religion, Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is very old. It is about 2,500 years old. It is different now than when Buddha was alive. You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. People there follow the Theravada way of Buddhism. They celebrate a special ceremony, the water-cutting ceremony. Many people participate in this ceremony. It has meaning for the people who follow this way.\n\nBuddhism has changed over time. This happened from the inside and the outside. The inside changes came from people who followed Buddha. The outside changes came from people who did not believe in Buddhism.\n\nTo understand these changes, we need to know some important words. The inside change is called internal. An internal force is something that comes from Buddhists. An external force is something that comes from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A hostile force is something that hurts Buddhism. A benign force is something that does not want to hurt or help Buddhism.\n\nNow, let's look at the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists want to be safe from suffering. They want to be safe from the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. Buddhists also want to be safe from three things: desire, hatred, and confusion. These three things cause suffering.\n\nBuddhists believe in three things that give them safety. They are the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha taught many things, but some of the most important are: there is no soul, life is suffering, and everything is not permanent. When people understand these things, they can escape the cycle of death and rebirth.\n\nBuddhists follow rules to live a good life. There are five rules for ordinary people. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145) This rivalry was very strong. The United States and Mexico fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The Americans won the war and took Texas and the American Southwest. \n\nMany problems happened between the two countries. They disagreed on important issues like religion, culture, and tradition. They also had different material interests. This is like other countries that have a long rivalry with a neighboring country. When countries share a border, they often disagree on things.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not alone in having a long rivalry. Other countries with borders also have disagreements. David M. Pletcher (1977) said that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find serious problems for the United States. Both of these countries are close to the United States and have been rivals.\n\nThe two countries disagreed on religious issues. This has been a problem for many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) said that Americans were against Catholicism and monarchy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The United States and Mexico had a similar problem, but it was about their different ways of thinking about God. This distrust came from the way the English and Spanish treated each other. The English and Spanish had a lot of distrust, and this was passed down to the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 disagreements between the United States and Mexico during the 57 years of their rivalry. Most of these disagreements were about land and people crossing the border. There were many problems with bandits and outlaws from one country coming into the other. This was a serious problem until the United States and Mexico used their military to control their borders.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries began to end as Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States also changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically. This change happened in the late 19th century.",

But as a child, I did not have a safe and secure life. I was told, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nEven so, at 46 years old, I was not working. I had no money and I could not work. To this day, I am still sick and I have been getting a small amount of money from the government for 15 years. I have nothing now. Every day is hard for me. I depend on my family and friends to help me.\n\nI know that life is hard. Sometimes big problems come and we cannot solve them alone. I agree that we should not rely on the government to solve all our problems. But we should help each other. We should be friendly and help our neighbors too.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism is good, but it is not the truth. Our ancestors who came to America did not cross the country alone. They worked together and helped each other.\n\nI am prepared for hard times. I have a kit with food, water, and other things I need in case of an emergency.

            "We want to know why living things change over time. What rules are they following? Although a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said in 1917 that we do not know much about how simple living things are made, this is still true today. Recently, people are using math to learn about how mollusks, like clams, make their shells. Our study is trying to use math and experiments to understand why and how living things change.\n\nWe are studying a kind of shellfish called Prunum. We took pictures of Prunum shells using special X-rays. We used these pictures to make numbers that we can use in a computer program to make pictures of what Prunum shells might look like. These pictures can help us understand what shells can look like.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It turns as it grows, like a spiral staircase. This staircase has lines that separate each turn, called sutures. The last turn is the biggest. The part of the shell above the last turn is called the spire. The small end of the spire is called the apex. The other end is called the base. The animal lives in the shell through a small opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. One way is from the top, one way is from the bottom, and one way is from the side. The usual way to look at a shell is from the side, with the opening toward us.\n\nTo count the turns of the shell, we look at it from the top and find the first line that separates two turns. We draw a line from this point to divide the shell into two parts. Then, we count the turns from this line. We can also count the size of the turns.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal makes as it grows its shell. We can use math to find this path and understand how the shell grows. We can change the math to see how the shell would grow if it were different.",
            "The health of babies and young children in Indonesia is a big problem.  For the last ten years, it has not improved very much.  Indonesia is on track to meet some of the goals set by the United Nations, but it is not making progress in improving the health of women and children.  The reasons for this are many and need to be discussed.\n\nIn Indonesia, more and more babies are being born with a doctor or nurse present, which is good.  But many of these workers are not doctors and cannot help if there are problems during delivery.  This means that many women are still dying from complications during pregnancy.  The number of children with diarrhea who see a doctor is also decreasing.  We do not have much information about how well new mothers are being cared for after they give birth.\n\nFewer babies are being born by surgery, which is good.  But this is mostly happening in cities, not in rural areas.  This shows that people in the country are not having the same access to healthcare services as people in the cities.  The poor are having a hard time getting the healthcare they need, probably because they cannot afford it.\n\nSo the question now is: how can Indonesia make healthcare better for babies and mothers?  The biggest question is: should Indonesia create special programs to solve these problems or strengthen the whole healthcare system?  One way to solve the problems is to give extra help to one area, like prenatal care or after-birth care for the mother and baby.  This can be effective, but it also has some problems.  One problem is that it can take money away from other important areas of healthcare.  This can cause people who work in healthcare to focus on the area with the most money and resources.  Also, having too many programs can cause confusion and waste.",
            "Two Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the rich people of that time. But two novels that are not like others from this period are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels have surprising and strange parts that help us understand the characters' thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the main character, Oliver, has strange thoughts and sees strange things. He hears two men arguing, Sikes and Crackit. They are loud and angry. Oliver is scared and confused. He sees and hears many strange things: loud noises, flashing lights, and people shouting. He feels a lot of pain.\n\nThe author uses strange events to show what is going on in Oliver's mind. These events often happen in his dreams or when he is feeling strange. When Oliver is shot, he relives the experience in his mind. He feels very scared and powerless. He does not have control over what happens to him.\n\nThe passage shows that Oliver has no control over his life. He is in a bad situation and cannot change it. This makes him feel defeated. He accepts his situation and cannot fight back.\n\nIn another novel, Wuthering Heights, the day is very long and very short. The sun does not shine. It is night and it is day at the same time. The silence is very scary and the time is very short.",
            "I worked with students at an after-school program a couple of years ago. I was a tutor for younger students, and my strengths were in English and reading. The program's instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. At first, I thought something was wrong with him. Some letters he could read, but others not at all. It was strange. He spoke perfect English, but I thought maybe he was from a Spanish-speaking family. I tried to help him, but it was hard. Then, his mother came to visit. She only spoke Spanish. We used simple words, and I used what little Spanish I knew. I then understood his problem: he knew English, but he didn't know the alphabet well. I don't know if he got better, but I hope he did.\n\nI tell this story to show the problem of language barriers in schools. Even if students speak perfect English, they can still struggle to read. This is a big problem in California. Everyone agrees it's a problem, but what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: more practice with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for other students who barely speak English, the answer is not clear. We need a combination of things: dual language systems, mainstream classes, private tutors, and English as a second language (ESL) classes.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps students who speak other languages and all students. Students in these programs do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it's not worth the money and that most students won't benefit. But that's not true. If we make these programs a part of our schools, all students will benefit. So, how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's not realistic. But we can have special helpers who understand two languages.",

            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what Ian Watt calls it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" Many people have looked down on the Gothic style, but others have praised it for its exciting and frightening parts. The original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by Horace Walpole, combines old and new ideas to create a new way of writing. Walpole uses old theatrical elements and new ways of writing to create a \"Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic style uses many ideas from the past, like medieval theatre, buildings, and traditions. Even when Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"Gothic\" meant many different things. People thought it was old-fashioned and unsophisticated. The combination of old and new ideas makes the Gothic style last a long time and become new again to readers who are far from the original time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It is a medieval idea that is both kept and changed in the original Gothic novel. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it shows what a good knight should be like: brave, honorable, and able. Gothic writers saw that their society did not have these qualities. They used chivalry in their writing to make the past seem better and to try to improve the present.\n\nHorace Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were not going well in his country. He was unhappy about the future. He might have thought that people in the past were better than people in his time. This is seen in the character of Frederic. Before we meet him, we know he has many chivalric qualities. He is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be dead. He is described as a gallant and courteous knight, which is an exaggeration. This shows the Gothic idea of excess.\n\nThe Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what makes it last a long time and become new again to readers who are far from the original time. The Gothic style uses many ideas from the past and combines them with new ways of writing to create a new way of telling stories.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of getting goods from the customer to the customer. It includes the stages of getting raw materials, making the product, and delivering it to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He said that supply chain management is planning, doing, and controlling all the things that happen to get the product to the customer quickly and efficiently. There are six important parts of a supply chain: making the product, getting the materials, keeping a stock of products, where the products are made, how the products are moved, and getting information about the products.\n\nThe first step in supply chain management is making the product. This is the start of the whole process. Making the product includes deciding when, why, where, and how to make it. Business managers need to know what the customers want. They can find out by looking at the market. The market shows them what the customers want and need. Once the managers know what the customers want, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory is best for making them, based on the customer's needs.\n\nThe next step is to schedule work and take care of the machines. After that, the managers focus on getting the products to the customers. This is a very important part of the supply chain process. Every small detail is important, and if it is not planned well, it can cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run.\n\nFor example, at a big retail store like Wal-Mart or Target, there are special plans and rules for every part of the business. There is a plan for how the employees should look, how the products should be received from the trucks, and how the store should be run. This helps the company to work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is getting the materials and products. This includes deciding what the company can do itself and what it should get from other companies. A company may have many different parts that make a single product. The manager must decide which part is best for each step of making the product. The manager may also decide to work with other companies to make the product. The main reason for working with other companies is to make the product quickly and at a low cost.",

The sign says something that makes people think. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of men with guns rule the country. They took power in 1962. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. The protests were the first in ten years. Many monks were leading the protests. The monks wear yellow robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution.\n\nAt first, the people in charge of the country let the monks hold meetings. But soon the government got angry and started to fight back. They hurt many people and destroyed many buildings. Journalists from other countries were arrested and imprisoned. A Japanese journalist was killed while he was covering the protests. The government said 13 people were killed, but a man who used to be in the army said many more people were killed.\n\nThis is not new. Many years ago, rulers wanted to have complete control over their people. Roman emperors said they had the right to make all the decisions. In Japan, the emperors are believed to be gods. They say they were sent to help people.\n\nIn the United States, the president has meetings with a man who leads a group called the Republican Party. Some examples of people being hurt by their rulers are the protests in China in 1989. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed, but others said 2,000-3,000 people were killed. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their skin color. The Nazis in Germany also hurt many people because of their skin color.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous musician. He made many great jazz pieces because he lived a long time and could keep creating new music. He often played the piano in his songs, but he was also a great composer. Ellington made music that showed off the special talents of each musician in his band. He created a framework where soloists could play freely and also wrote tightly organized parts that used each musician's style.\n\nEllington was a master at making the orchestra sound great together. He wrote music that was original and fit well with each piece. He knew how to use the sound of each musician and how they worked together to create new and exciting music.\n\nOne example of Ellington's work is the song \"Creole Love Call.\" It is a slow blues song with a call and response between voice and other instruments. The song starts with a smooth, melodic voice, then becomes rougher at the end. This shows Ellington's ability to mix different sounds and styles.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" the music is divided into six parts. Each part is different, but they all fit together well. The song has a muted trumpet solo that adds to the melody. A clarinet solo is also important, with a piano that plays a subtle, syncopated rhythm. The final part of the song returns to the call and response between voice and instruments.\n\nEllington's use of voice in his music is an important part of his style. In \"Creole Love Call,\" the voice is used like an instrument to add different colors and textures to the music. This is one way Ellington made his music special.\n\nIn another song, \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington uses his skill at organizing music and his ability to hear different sounds to create a rich and interesting sound. The song has a call and response between a trumpet player and a singer, creating a unique and complementary sound. Ellington also uses a trombone player to introduce a melody.\n\nEllington's music is full of new and exciting ideas. He was a master of using the sounds of each musician and making them work together to create something special. His music is still popular today and is considered some of the best jazz ever written.",

The Mediterranean Diet is a healthy way of eating that includes many plant foods, a little fish, and some nuts.

This new study wanted to know about stroke.\n\nResearchers looked at 74,886 women between the ages of 38 and 63. They asked these women about their eating habits six times between 1984 and 2004. The women also reported about their health, including if they had any heart problems.\n\nThe researchers found that women who ate a lot of Mediterranean diet foods were less likely to have heart disease and stroke. They also found that these women were less likely to die from heart disease and stroke. The researchers used a special score to measure how well the women followed the Mediterranean Diet.\n\nTo make the study more accurate, the researchers averaged the scores from the past two years to get a better idea of each woman's eating habits. They also controlled for factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of Mediterranean diet foods were 29% less likely to have heart disease and stroke than women who did not follow the diet as well. This study shows that eating a healthy Mediterranean Diet can help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
            "In two thousand seven, the United States had a serious financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market got worse. The economy was in trouble, and many large businesses were in bad shape. This problem is still happening today. We need to ask, how did this happen and how can we stop it?\n\nThe financial problem was caused by bad decisions made by politicians. They wanted banks to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was because the country wanted to help people who did not have enough money. But the banks did not have enough money to cover these loans. They sold these bad loans to other companies, and the problem spread.\n\nThe companies that sold these bad loans were called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They took these bad loans and made new investments called CDOs and CDSs. When people could not pay back the loans, the banks did not have enough money. The banks then gave the problem to the other companies that had bought the bad loans. This caused a big problem in the economy.\n\nThis problem started in nineteen ninety-nine. The President at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to be re-elected. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans. This made it easier for people to buy houses, but it also made the banks give out bad loans. A reporter named Steve Holmes wrote about this problem in nineteen ninety-nine. He said, \"Fannie Mae is giving out too many loans to people who cannot pay them back. This could cause big problems in the future.\"\n\nIndeed, many things worked together to make the economy worse. Banks gave out new kinds of loans that were hard to understand. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages and CDOs. They made the economy more connected to the housing market. This made people and banks borrow too much money, and they were not prepared for when the housing market went down.\n\nWhen the housing market went down, many banks had trouble. They had borrowed too much money and could not pay it back. The big banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This is a lot of money. In the end, some banks went out of business. The government had to take control of Fannie and Freddie, which had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans.",
            "Many writers know about exposition.  It's the part of a story where you tell the reader a lot of information at once.  This can make the reader bored or want to stop reading.  Dr. Merlin says that exposition is not your friend.\n\nYou already know the tip \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes this mistake.  Exposition is like a little devil that says to get the background out of the way so you can get to the good parts.\n\nExposition means saying what happened.  It's like a character telling another character a lot of information at once.  In fiction, the author does the telling.\n\nFor example, you read a story and are told that a woman met her husband at a certain time and place.  You're also told that he was murdered in front of her.  You would not expect this to take two pages, with not much happening during that time.  You would want to know more about the husband's character, how he loved his wife, and how she felt about him.  This would make you care about them and their story.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would give you more information about the heroine too.  You would understand why she loved him and how his death affected her.  You would be sad when he dies and care more about the heroine.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add more to the story.  It's easy to rush past some parts, but you should not.  You might introduce a new character and want to tell the reader a lot about him at once.  But you should not do this.  Instead, show the reader more about the character as the story goes on.\n\nFor example, you might tell the reader that a man used to be in the Air Force, is now a gas station manager, and has two ex-wives.  But you should not say he likes to fish on the weekends and dreams of owning the gas station.  Show this by what he says and does in the story.",
            "I saw two news programs from Columbus, Ohio, on the same day. The first one I saw was on NBC 4 in the morning. The lead story was a man in Ashley, Ohio, who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. The police arrested him. The newscaster showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news show talked about this story for only two minutes. I think it was enough time.\n\nThe next story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He is in the hospital. There are no arrests yet. The police are searching for the person who did this. This story was short. I think it might be because the police are still looking for the person who did it.\n\nI noticed something. When a white person is a victim, the news shows it a lot. But when a minority person is a victim, they do not show it as much. This is something I have noticed before.\n\nThe news also showed a story about a helicopter. A bullet hit it. The police are looking for the person who did it. They are offering money for information.\n\nThe news also talked about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be warm.\n\nThe news also showed a story about a store that was robbed. The man who robbed it is black. He was wearing a hoodie. He is six feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. I think they showed his picture too much.\n\nThere was another story about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The news said 300 months instead of years. I am not sure why they said it like that.",
            "Brothers have a strong bond. It is not easy to break. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brothers. Brothers can see the good and bad in themselves when they look at their brothers. This bond can bring many strong feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and hurt. Brothers can only see themselves when they look at their brother.\n\nIn a book called \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show what this bond can be like. They go on a hard journey through a beautiful and colorful place. They have strong feelings of pride and disappointment. One brother survives. \n\nThe main character's actions are guided by one strong feeling: pride. He wants a brother who can do things like run and jump. But his little brother, Doodle, cannot do these things. Doodle was born with a weak heart. He may not even live. This makes the brother very sad. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiles, he feels love. His heart is not hard. He loves his brother.\n\nThis story shows that brothers can have strong feelings for each other. These feelings can be good or bad. But they are real. Brothers can only see themselves when they look at their brother. They can see their own feelings and actions.",
            "The brain is a very complex system that helps us think and learn. As technology has improved, people have used different ways to compare the brain to other things. At first, it was compared to a piece of wax, then to paper, then to a book, and now to a computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons are not very good and can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain starts to process information when it receives signals from our senses. These signals come from things like touch, heat, sound, or light. The brain changes this information into signals that can be understood. It does this in two ways: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together simple information like color and shape to decide it's a box. Top-down processing helps you recognize the box faster by using the decisions made earlier.\n\nThe brain decides what information is important and what to do with it. For instance, when you look down at your shoes, you don't notice every blade of grass, but you might hear your name in a noisy room. There are many steps in the way the brain processes information, and attention helps at each step.\n\nFor the brain to work, it needs to store information. There are different types of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain stores information in a special way. For example, when we hear words, the brain stores them in different ways, such as how they look, sound, or mean. When information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies show that working memory, which lasts about 20 seconds, is kept by a signal moving through some brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some are based on how people remember things, others are based on computers, and others are based on how the brain works. One idea, the semantic network, says that there are nodes representing ideas, and that the nodes are connected based on how they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which can be connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley is critical of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He creates a world where people value their community above themselves and pursue happiness above all else. The people in this world are conditioned to obey one ideology and do not think for themselves. This is a commentary on the problems of the capitalist system.\n\nHuxley uses Marxist ideas to show his concerns about capitalism. He talks about how people are kept from knowing the truth about their place in society. This is called false consciousness. People are interested in their own gain and do not see the problems of the system. The World Controller controls the people and makes them think they are happy when they are really not.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are conditioned to want things they do not need. They are taught to spend and indulge. The different classes in society, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own thoughts. They are controlled by the World Controller. The upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are also controlled but do not do much to change the system.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have deep relationships. The characters are not very different from each other. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist in this world. People talk about each other's bodies and not about their feelings.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are very happy with their place in society. They do not try to change the system. This is like the Marxist idea of the proletariat, who are told they are better than others if they obey the rules. But Huxley is saying that this is not true.\n\nHuxley's ideas in Brave New World are a warning about the dangers of capitalism and technology. He wants people to think about the problems of the system and not just follow the rules.",
            "I am a student at University Park. It has been two and a half years since I came here. Getting around campus can be hard. My first year I lived in a dorm called East Halls. It is on the east side of campus. My classes were in the Willard building, near the center of campus. It took 25 minutes to walk to class. Sometimes it took longer because of the weather.\n\nThe East Halls dorms used to be far from the rest of the campus. Now it is not so far. New buildings and apartments have been added to the area. The campus is getting bigger. It is harder to get from one place to another.\n\nA good way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But bicycles alone are not enough. Students need to ride them and the campus needs to be built for people who ride bikes.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said that riding a bike is a great way to get around. It is good for the body and it is fast. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. I ride my bike to class every day. The ride is 25 minutes on foot, but 5 minutes on a bike. The road I ride on is not easy to travel. But I have no choice. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking would take too long. It would take over 2 hours every week. I do not have that much time."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.

            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I want to help people who are in trouble. I want to improve my skills to be a good social worker.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. But I was not sure which job to choose. In school, I saw people who were afraid to face their problems. I saw people who used bad ways to deal with their problems. I studied psychology to help people. After I finished college in 2009, I took a break. One day, a friend showed me a 16-year-old boy who was very nervous. His parents were hurting him. The next day, the boy called the police. I drove to his house to help. I told the police I was a psychology graduate. They asked me to talk to the parents. I asked them questions. They said their son was being manipulative. I realized I wanted to help children in this situation.\n\nSocial justice is also very important to me. Our society says the individual is special, but we often want to be like everyone else. I am different and I do not want to be like others. In school, I spoke out against unfairness: I colored my hair, wore what I wanted, and stood up against racism and discrimination.

            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep disorder: the biological model and the sociocultural model. The biological model looks at genetic information and medical health. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment affects sleep. We will explain these models and discuss the research that supports them.\n\nA sleep disorder is a problem with sleeping. It can be a main problem or a problem related to another health issue. There are two main types of sleep disorders: primary sleep disorders and sleep disorders related to mental health. Primary sleep disorders include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and breathing sleep disorder. Insomnia is a problem with sleeping at night, hypersomnia is a problem with staying awake, and narcolepsy is a problem with falling asleep suddenly. \n\nThe biological model of sleep focuses on genes and the body's physical parts that control sleep. Scientists have found that special cells in the brain called orexin help control sleep and wakefulness. They tested this idea on mice and found that special receptors on these cells help control sleep. If these receptors are not working correctly, it can cause problems with sleep. This shows that genetics and the body can affect sleep. This means that if someone has a problem with these receptors, they may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the environment and our surroundings affect sleep. This can include things like our culture, family, and income level. People from different cultures may have different sleep patterns. For example, some cultures sleep a lot during the day and are awake at night. This can affect how well they do in school or at work. If someone's environment is not good for sleep, it can cause problems with sleep.",
            "This paper is about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). We will explain three main parts. First, we will define CAPD. Next, we will explain how doctors diagnose the disorder. Finally, we will talk about how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a regular classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses what we hear. The brain cannot properly understand sounds. People with CAPD can hear normally. They do not have trouble hearing. But their brain has trouble understanding what they hear. It is like when you hear many noises and have trouble understanding what someone is saying.\n\nThe first mention of CAPD was in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children who had trouble communicating. They developed tests for these children in 1954. In 1961, another researcher introduced a way to test how the brain uses sound information. A big conference in 1977 helped researchers learn more about CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. A person with CAPD may have trouble finding the source of a sound. They may have trouble understanding two or more sounds at the same time. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may not be able to tell if someone is being serious or joking. One sound can cover up another sound. They may not be able to understand how to use sound clues. And they may not be able to understand how sounds come in order.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, doctors use different methods. They watch the patient's behavior and perform tests on their hearing. Doctors may use questionnaires and surveys, or watch how the patient responds to different sounds. There is no one test that works for everyone. There is no known reason why CAPD happens. Tests may present many sounds at the same time and ask the patient to choose the right one.\n\nIn a regular classroom, a teacher can help a student with CAPD. The teacher can provide extra help with listening and following directions. The teacher can also use visual aids to help the student understand what is being said. For example, the teacher can write down what they are saying. This can help the student understand better. The teacher can also seat the student in a quiet area of the classroom to help them focus.",
            "This play says that wearing a disguise can help us trick people, but it can also cause problems. A big problem is that we may hurt our relationships with others when the truth comes out. \n\nIn the play Twelfth Night, a woman named Viola wears a man's clothes to protect herself. She pretends to be a man so that she is safe. But this trick makes her lose touch with her friends. She also has to deal with romantic feelings she has for a man and a woman. \n\nViola is good at pretending to be a man. But she also causes a problem for the man she loves and the woman who loves him. The woman thinks Viola is actually a man named Sebastian. \n\nThis play is like a mirror for the characters. It shows their true feelings. The woman who loves the man and the man who loves the woman both have secret feelings. They don't know what they really want. \n\nBut does this mean that the woman really likes women too? The play doesn't say. It's like the woman is making fun of people who judge others based on how they look. \n\nIn the end, Viola is not a man anymore. The truth comes out, and she is no longer a trick. But she has hurt her friends and caused problems. This is a big problem with wearing a disguise. It can hurt the people we love.",
            "German rule in Africa was very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. But this is not the full story of the German colonial rule. The rule was different in different places and the treatment of people was not the same everywhere. \n\nIn German East Africa, the British found many Africans who could read and write when they took control in 1919. German education in Kamerun and other colonies was also good. People wrote about these good things at the time.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa, now called Namibia, was very different. The government did not make many schools for Africans like they did in East Africa. Instead, some missionary groups helped with education, but they did not get much help from the government. The government did make schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools more. This made a big difference in South West Africa. While many Africans in other colonies were able to read and write, most people in South West Africa were not educated. \n\nThere are many books about education in the German colonies. Most of these books were written in German and were written a long time ago. They just told about the schools in the colonies. Later, more books were written in English. They compared the schools in different colonies and looked at specific parts of the education system. One important book looked at the schools in South West Africa and East Africa. The author said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was a big reason for the difference in the education system.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but much of the land is hot desert. Many white people lived in South West Africa because of the good climate. By 1913, there were 15,000 white people living there. In contrast, only 5,336 white people lived in East Africa.",
            "Popular music is a big group of music styles. It has grown a lot over the last 100 years. There are many different kinds of music, and it is hard to make a complete list. Most music styles have smaller groups inside them. For example, rock music has many small groups like metal, jazz, and folk. The metal music group is one of the most interesting and expressive music styles in the past 40 years. It is expressive because it shows a wide range of feelings, mostly the sad or scary kinds. It is diverse because people started to make their own kinds of metal music after it began. This started a chain of smaller groups and smaller groups inside those groups.\n\nToday, it is hard to say what metal music really is. It has taken ideas from other music styles, but it came from somewhere. To understand modern metal music, we need to know what metal music is and why it is a movement.\n\nMetal music is often about darkness. It is often louder and more violent than other music. Metal musicians are very good at playing their instruments. The music is different from other music because it is not simple. It is a movement that was influenced by drug use in the 1970s. People used drugs to create new and crazy sounds. Metal music has many qualities that are not found in other music, like feelings of sadness and fear. Later metal musicians took some of these qualities from the Romantic Era. Some examples of metal music show the darker side of emotions. For example, the Beatles wrote a song called Helter Skelter. It shows the ups and downs of life, like the effects of drugs. This song is often called one of the first metal songs. The Beatles wanted to show that they could be as heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a painter in the early nineteen hundreds. He dreamed of making beautiful pictures that people would love. He wanted to be known and respected by other artists and art lovers. His famous painting \"The Dream\" is like a picture of his own dreams and goals. But he had a big problem. He wanted to make his own kind of art, not like other famous painters. He wanted to be unique.\n\nTo understand Rousseau's painting, we need to know a little bit about his life. He was born in a town in northwest France in eighteen forty-four. His father was a maker of metal things and a seller. He was a happy man with a good life. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for many years doing a job for the city. When he was forty, he started painting. He wanted to make art to make himself feel better after a sad time in his life.\n\nMany other artists were making good art at the same time as Rousseau. He was not famous until a long time after he started painting. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he did not want to copy others. He wanted to make his own kind of art. The author Jan Gordon said that Rousseau wanted to make art that was simple, so people would like it. On the other hand, a famous artist named Matisse wanted to make art that was new and different.\n\nRousseau was a folk painter. He made pictures that everyday people could understand. He was not like other artists who made pictures of peasants and made them look beautiful. Rousseau's pictures were like the people who lived in his town.\n\nHis main problem was that he wanted to be accepted by the art world. He wanted to be like other famous artists, but he did not want to copy them. He wanted to be different.",
            "Many people think there is a close connection between right and wrong and what is beautiful. I believe there is a reason for this. The famous writer John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty. That is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through school or experience. But we like what is right and what is beautiful without being taught. Both right and beautiful are ways to describe, not to tell us what to do. We try to understand why something is good or beautiful, but we can't fully explain it. \n\nFor example, people may talk about the painting Mona Lisa by da Vinci. They may say it has good background, contrast, and setting. But these do not explain why it is great art. When we talk about something we like, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This \"something\" is hard to explain. I think right and beautiful have this same \"something.\" The writer Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We can describe a story or its qualities, but there is still something more. I think right and good have this same quality. \n\nEthics and aesthetics, or right and beautiful, are closely connected because we experience them in the same way. We can feel them, but we can't fully explain them. This connection is stronger in literature. The writer McKean said, \"Literature is unique because of its moral quality.\" Literature is important to us because it shows us values. We use values in life, and literature helps us understand them.",
            "Germany is a strong country today. It is a united country with a special culture. This culture comes from many different parts of Germany. People in Germany live near mountains and rivers like the Rhine. They live in cities like Munich, Kiel, and Dresden.\n\nGermany has a long history. It comes from several different tribes and groups. The word 'Germany' comes from many different sources. Some people think it comes from a group of people called the Tungrians. They lived in the area before the river Rhine.\n\nThe Roman writer Julius Caesar first used the word 'German' in his book about the Gauls. He used it to talk about the people he fought against. He read this word from the Gauls themselves. They used it to talk about their neighbors.\n\nJulius Caesar wrote that the Germans lived beyond the river Rhine. They were at war with the Gauls all the time. The Gauls and Germans fought each other every day. \n\nSome people think the word 'German' comes from a spear called a 'ger'. This is a type of spear that people used in battles. Others think it comes from a word in the Old Irish language. This word means 'to shout'. It might mean that the Germans were loud and noisy.\n\nA Roman writer named Tacitus wrote a book about the Germans in AD 98. He said that the Germans were an old group of people. They did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild place with bad weather and strong people.\n\nThe Romans did not want to live in Germany. They went to Germany to get things and to fight. They would come back to their big empire. The Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and worked for the Romans.",
            "I looked down at the view in front of me.  I was not thinking about it.  My mind was a blank.  I was studying it, but I was not thinking about it.  I was just looking.\n\nI wanted to learn to draw when I was six years old.  An artist I worked with told me to buy a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.  The book teaches you how to draw.  It teaches you how to use a pencil and how the brain sees lines.\n\nThe book says to put a square around a picture.  This makes the picture simpler.  I could not do that right then.  I was looking at a bowl of fruit.  I was amazed.\n\nMany famous artists saw the world differently.  Picasso liked blue.  Monet liked green.  I thought my picture could be like theirs.  I looked at the bowl and thought it was the start of my picture.\n\nMy hand went to the pencil.  I wanted to draw.  But I had to clean the toilet instead.  There was a brown package in the toilet bowl.  I tried to move it, but it was stuck.  The package was a problem.  I used a mop to try and move it.  But the mop was not working.\n\nI stood back and thought.  Then I used the toilet paper to clean the bowl.  I had to get the package out.  I dipped my hand into the bowl to get it.  It was not easy.",
            "Many young people die in car accidents.  There are several reasons for this.  One reason is that the brains of teenagers are not yet ready to handle the dangers of driving.  Teenagers also do not have much driving experience.  This lack of experience causes many serious accidents, including rollover accidents, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeenagers often drive with their friends, which makes the situation worse.  A study looked at how old the passengers are when accidents happen.  The study found a strong connection between the age of the passenger and the number of accidents.\n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teenagers by giving them temporary licenses that limit the hours they can drive and do not allow other teenagers to be passengers.  However, I think these temporary licenses are not enough.  The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  A psychologist named Marvin Zuckerman says that even 18-year-olds are too young to drive without restrictions.  He has done research that shows people under 19-20 years old often want to take risks just for the fun of it.  It makes sense to wait until this tendency to take risks goes away before giving teenagers a regular driver's license.  If we continue to give licenses to young teens, many more people will die in car accidents.\n\nWe can make a law to solve this problem.  Schools can teach driving classes to future drivers.  But no one under 18 can drive a car.  A temporary permit can still be given before a regular license.  And drivers need to practice for a certain number of hours with a grown-up.  The number of hours can be the same as most states already require.  For example, in California, drivers need 6 hours of practice with a grown-up and 50 hours of practice on their own.  A national law would be a good way to keep teenagers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  But it is a good idea to make driving safer for everyone.",
            "I looked at the movies from the early days of film. I wanted to see the trick films made by Thomas Edison. There were fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make things look real. My study of these films focused on how they worked and how they changed over time.\n\nMost of the trick films from this time period are set inside a theater. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style of filmmaking comes from theater and magic shows.\n\nOne of the things that all the trick films have in common is that they are filmed inside a theater set. The camera does not move to follow the actors. This style was very popular at the time and came from theater and magic shows. \n\nIn these films, the actors usually move side-to-side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors come in from one side and move back and forth. They do not move towards or away from the camera.\n\nThe trick films also use long and medium shots. They almost never use close-up shots. This comes from theater and magic shows, where the whole performance is seen at once. In these early films, the actors do not move towards the camera, so close-up shots are not used.\n\nMost trick films from this time are very short. They are usually a minute or less. This is because they are made up of one idea or one action. However, a single \"shot\" can be made up of many parts. This is how the trick films make people disappear or appear. Look at \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895) to see an example of this. If you look closely, you can see where the different parts of the film are joined together to make the illusion work.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong supporter of the Republican Party. He was a farmer, but his work and short time in politics made him known for his strong opinions. He believed in personal freedom and a limited government.\n\nTaylor thought that the United States was special because it had no old traditions to follow. This gave its leaders the chance to make a perfect system of government. He believed people have basic rights that must not be taken away. If one right is denied, all are lost. These rights must be safe from the government.\n\nTaylor said that in nature, strong people often get what they want. But in a society, this should not happen. He believed a good government must understand the good and bad in people. Taylor thought a government with good principles would be fair, even if its leaders are not.\n\nHe believed good principles protect private property, help farmers, and stop greed. A government with these principles would work well, even if its leaders are selfish. Taylor thought self-interest was bad only when it hurts others. He wanted a government to keep people's bad sides under control.\n\nTaylor wanted the government to follow the Constitution exactly. He wanted a small government with no extra powers. He thought a big government would be expensive and unfair. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution can be wrong. He wanted to understand the writers' intentions.\n\nTaylor thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution. It says the United States is a group of states, not one country.",
            "The number of people who submitted commuter logs dropped a lot in the third month of the project. This was unpleasant and not easy to understand. One reason might be the cold winter weather in New England. Fewer people ride their bicycles or walk in the cold. December is also the end of the fall semester. People are busy finishing schoolwork and getting grades. They might not have time to submit commuter logs. The December holiday season is also a time when students and teachers do not need to come to campus. Classes start again in late January. But none of these reasons explains why the number of submissions was low in February. It is possible that a new project always starts with a lot of energy and excitement, but this excitement naturally ends. We had a Carpool Challenge Week in March to try and make the project more interesting again. This helped increase the number of submissions. One problem we faced was how to keep the project going when people are naturally less involved during the holiday and semester breaks. \n\nAnother problem is that many people like driving their cars because it gives them freedom and independence. This is a big part of our culture. To get people to use other ways to travel, we need to give them good reasons to do so. We gave out prizes like gift cards to local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, like a new bicycle or car, would have affected the project. This might have helped the project stay strong even when people were less involved. The prizes we gave out did not change much during the project. If we had increased the prizes over time, that might have helped keep people interested. The gift cards were good at the start, but if we had promised bigger prizes in December and January, more people might have been interested and participated in the project.",
            "An ETF is a type of investment. It is like an index fund. But it is more flexible. It trades like a stock on the stock exchange. An ETF gives you the protection of an index fund. It also gives you the benefits of owning one stock. You can sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time.\n\nETFs have low costs. They are lower than the costs of the average mutual fund. But ETFs have some problems. You have to pay a fee for trading. This is like paying a fee to buy a stock. There are many types of ETFs available. But it is a good idea to check if the benefits you are promised are real.\n\nWe are looking at one ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up the ETF. We want to see if owning one ETF is like owning a group of 10 stocks. We also want to see if there is a better way to use these stocks.\n\nIt would be hard to look at all the stocks in the ETF. So we are only looking at the top 10 stocks. These stocks make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and how much of the ETF they make up.\n\nWe want to see if these 10 stocks are a good representation of the ETF. We can use a chart to see if they are similar to the ETF. The chart shows how much each stock contributes to the Beta and Return of the ETF.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in returns. The Beta of the top 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means that the portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could provide a higher return with less risk.\n\nBut we need to be sure that this is not just a chance. We need to check if the difference is real. We will look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks. This will help us understand how much risk each stock has. We will then compare the total risk of the 10 stocks to the risk of the ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land\". One of his better poems, Poe said. In this poem, Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" twice. This word comes from the Latin poet Virgil. Virgil used it to describe a place north of Britain that the ancient Greeks considered the end of the world.\n\nThere is another source for the word \"Thulé\". Poe liked the writing of German authors. He was influenced by a famous writer named Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". This play was first published in 1808 and later in 1832, the year Goethe died. \"Faust\" is a story about a man who makes a deal with the devil.\n\nIn \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". This poem is about a king who loses his wife and then becomes very sad. He drinks a lot and cries. Eventually, he decides to die. The king's story is similar to the main character's story in \"Dream-Land\". This similarity may show that Poe was thinking of Goethe's story when he wrote \"Dream-Land\".\n\nGoethe's \"Faust\" was also made into a play by another writer in 1842. This play was published just a year before Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in another one of his poems called \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". Poe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land\", at the beginning and end of the poem. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a dark and lonely place called Thulé. This place is a world without color and is haunted by the speaker's dead friends.\n\nPoe was familiar with Goethe's work. He admired the work of another famous writer named Tennyson. Poe said he respected Tennyson. Poe would have also known Goethe's work because many copies of his books were published after the original. This means that many people could read Goethe's work, including Poe.",
            "Can a customer who hurt herself after slipping and falling on applesauce in a grocery store get money from the store because the manager acted very badly? The manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge will not quickly say no to Jennifer Palmer's claim for extra money. To get extra money, Jennifer must show that the manager acted on purpose to cause harm. She must also show that his actions were very bad. Jennifer can say that Martin should have known the spill was a problem because many customers had slipped on the floor before and got hurt. Martin still did not clean up the spill, even knowing this.\n\nJennifer can argue that Martin acted very badly because six people slipped and fell in the store in 2009, but he did not do anything to make the store safe. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J.

            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics we discussed was if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is more important now than ever.  Since 9/11, I have seen the media's view of Islam change from very negative to very positive.  I do not think it was possible in 2001 for a presidential candidate to be named Barack Obama, who has Muslim family members.\n\nThe story of the Prophet Muhammad is interesting to me.  According to what I know, his history does not match his personality.  I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslims.  He would conquer tribes and make them become Muslims.  But in the biography, Muhammad is written as a kind and humble man.  People came to see the truth in his teaching on their own.\n\nThere are some similarities between Jesus and Muhammad.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food for forty men.  I think this writing style makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who did not need to prove anything.  This is a problem because it downplays the life of Jesus.  It is like they are taking credit for Jesus' life. \n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem like the authors want to show how people became Muslims on their own.  But these stories are often from people who heard from others.  I do not like this because it makes the stories seem less true.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is that the biography tries to make Muhammad a kind and gentle man.  But history says he was not like that.  I wonder if Muslims today know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The ideas of Jesus and what he believed during his life were not kept after his death. Instead, the development of Christian thought moved forward. If we look at Christian history, we see a pattern of moving away from the beginning. Today, many people are becoming more aware and moving forward in a new way. Traditional people want to keep things the same. They will not want to change. But they may not have enough power to stop the change. In the future, many Christians will want to know more about the history of their religion. They will try to understand the original ideas of Jesus and the ideas that people added later. It may take a long time, but eventually, this will happen. The result will be a change in Christian history. People will go back to the original ideas of Jesus. They will remove the ideas that were added later. It will be like the clock moving backward. When this happens, the church will remain strong. The church will help people understand and follow the original ideas of Jesus. As a result, there will be less difference between people and groups of people. There will be more agreement in what they believe and do. \n\nWe have seen this happen before in history. The Roman Empire used to persecute Christians. But later, it became a Christian empire. Our country used to treat African-Americans badly. But now they have leadership positions.\n\nTo make this change possible, people need to understand that Jesus' words can be used as examples, not as facts. If we look back at the beginning of Christianity, we see that it started with Judaism. Christians believe in one god and the authority of the Jewish scriptures. But the Jewish people did not agree on one idea. They had different groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and others.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people deep down are often selfish and only think about themselves. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The Jungle shows this in many ways. One example is the factory owners. They only want to make their factories bigger and more successful. They do not care about anything that gets in their way. According to the author, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky.\" He is showing the big damage from pollution. The owners do not care about people or animals that get hurt. They do not care about the big clouds of smoke from the factories or the bad water from the animal pens.\n\nThe factory owners also do not care about their workers. They want to make a lot of money, so they make their workers work long hours. They can lay off many workers at a time without giving them any help. During the time the story is set, there were no laws to protect workers. This allowed the owners to be cruel to their workers. The workers had to work in bad conditions and live in bad places. There were no groups to help them. Some unions were formed, but they often made money from the workers. The workers were treated very badly and had no way to escape. They were like slaves. This is why the author says immorality is very common in this situation.\n\nThe Jungle shows that people in power do not care about others. They only care about themselves and making their lives better. They do not think about the people who are suffering.",
            "Some writers try to make readers feel a certain way about important things. They use different techniques to do this. Some techniques work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a good example. He uses many of these techniques in his book The Great Gatsby.\n\nFitzgerald uses a special way to make readers feel something about a subject. He pairs two words together that are not usually together. This is called a combination. He also uses a symbol and gives it a special meaning. Then he uses that symbol again to make readers feel something.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with colors. He gives each color a special meaning. He uses these colors to make readers feel something about important things. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald uses the colors white and gray. He wants readers to think of these colors when they think of certain people or things.\n\nFitzgerald says that white and gray are the same, but with a difference. White is better and more important. Gray is older and faded. Fitzgerald shows this in the beginning of the book. Many characters wear white clothes. Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Other characters wear white too. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick talks about Gatsby's party. Nick says the party is colorful.\n\nFitzgerald uses these colors with many other things. He uses white and gray to describe unimportant things. He makes readers think that these colors are not exciting. He uses these colors to describe Daisy too. He makes readers see Daisy as just a character, not as a person. Fitzgerald wants readers to think that Daisy is not special.\n\nFitzgerald uses the colors white and gray to make readers feel something about important things. He gives them a special meaning and then uses them again to make readers feel something. This is how he makes readers see things in a certain way.",
            "San Diego County is a very good place for growing food. The weather is mild and sunny. Many common crops grow there, like tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits such as peaches and lemons. Some people also grow berries, honey, and peppers. There is a big market for food from organic farms. Many people in the area want to buy this type of food. Some farms offer tours and allow people to hike and watch birds.\n\nOrganic farms have many benefits. They help keep the soil and water clean. This makes the area have more plants and animals. But organic farming can be more expensive. It needs more work and management to remove pests and weeds and to make the soil healthy without using chemicals. It also has bigger losses than farming with chemicals. A small organic farm is not as efficient as a big farm.\n\nThe land for this example is 160 acres in unincorporated San Diego County, near the town of Potrero. It has chaparral, grass and oak trees. It is in the Cleveland National Forest. Many plants and animals live there, including some that are endangered. These include the kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and some kinds of butterflies. Some animals are getting fewer in number and may become endangered soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nPeople lived on this land a long time ago. Later, cattle ranchers and wood sellers lived there. The land was used for grazing and making wood. Now, a small farmer wants to grow food and take care of the wildlife. The farmer looks at government programs to get help and save money. The farmer also looks at a nearby organic farm to see what they do.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiations. But culture can be difficult to understand. It is not one thing. It is many things. Many people think all people from a certain country are the same. But they are not. For example, not all Russians are stubborn, and not all Japanese are polite. These ideas are too simple.\n\nWhen we meet people from another culture, we compare them to people from our own culture. This can cause problems. Instead of trying to understand another culture, we should try to accept it. We should work within its rules. This is especially important in negotiations. If we come to the table with a weak position, we need to respect the other culture.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. A company may work long hours or have a relaxed schedule. We can see a company's culture in its dress code, how people talk, and who they hire. Different companies have different cultures. Even in the same country, companies can be very different.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important. Values tell us why people behave in certain ways. If people value saving face, they will not do something that might look bad. If people value settling a deal quickly, they will not wait for a better offer. To be a good negotiator, we need to understand these values.\n\nBefore a negotiation, we should learn about the other person's culture and values. This will help us to succeed. But we should also try to learn about our opponent on a personal level. This will make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The Bible says, “The fool says, 'There is no God.'\" This idea is important to St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. They both think God exists. We will look at their ideas to see which one is better.\n\nWe will start by assuming they are both right. This is because their ideas are about the God of the Bible. If we said they were talking about a different kind of God, we could not compare their ideas.\n\nLet's look at St. Anselm's idea. He says God exists because we can think about him. He says that God is inside our minds. We can understand that God exists without looking outside of ourselves. St. Anselm thinks that faith is enough for us to know God.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can prove God exists with reason and facts. He does not need faith. St. Thomas says there are five good reasons for believing in God. He says:\n\n1. Change happens. This means something has a cause.\n2. We need someone to cause things to happen.\n3. Some things are not necessary. This means they have a purpose.\n4. There are different levels of good and bad.\n5. The world has order.\n\nSt. Thomas says these reasons prove God exists.",
            "Long ago, a prince was born. He would be called Buddha. This happened in the fifth or sixth century before Christ. The prince renounced the world and became a wise man. He taught people the path to happiness. His teachings formed a new religion, Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is very old. It is about 2,500 years old. It is different now than when Buddha was alive. You can see this in the country of Sri Lanka. People there follow the Theravada way of Buddhism. They celebrate a special ceremony, the water-cutting ceremony. Many people participate in this ceremony. It has meaning for the people who follow this way.\n\nBuddhism has changed over time. This happened from the inside and the outside. The inside changes came from people who followed Buddha. The outside changes came from people who did not believe in Buddhism.\n\nTo understand these changes, we need to know some important words. The inside change is called internal. An internal force is something that comes from Buddhists. An external force is something that comes from people who do not believe in Buddhism. A hostile force is something that hurts Buddhism. A benign force is something that does not want to hurt or help Buddhism.\n\nNow, let's look at the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists want to be safe from suffering. They want to be safe from the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. Buddhists also want to be safe from three things: desire, hatred, and confusion. These three things cause suffering.\n\nBuddhists believe in three things that give them safety. They are the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha taught many things, but some of the most important are: there is no soul, life is suffering, and everything is not permanent. When people understand these things, they can escape the cycle of death and rebirth.\n\nBuddhists follow rules to live a good life. There are five rules for ordinary people. For monks, there are many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145) This rivalry was very strong. The United States and Mexico fought a war from 1846 to 1848. The Americans won the war and took Texas and the American Southwest. \n\nMany problems happened between the two countries. They disagreed on important issues like religion, culture, and tradition. They also had different material interests. This is like other countries that have a long rivalry with a neighboring country. When countries share a border, they often disagree on things.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not alone in having a long rivalry. Other countries with borders also have disagreements. David M. Pletcher (1977) said that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find serious problems for the United States. Both of these countries are close to the United States and have been rivals.\n\nThe two countries disagreed on religious issues. This has been a problem for many countries throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) said that Americans were against Catholicism and monarchy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The United States and Mexico had a similar problem, but it was about their different ways of thinking about God. This distrust came from the way the English and Spanish treated each other. The English and Spanish had a lot of distrust, and this was passed down to the United States and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 disagreements between the United States and Mexico during the 57 years of their rivalry. Most of these disagreements were about land and people crossing the border. There were many problems with bandits and outlaws from one country coming into the other. This was a serious problem until the United States and Mexico used their military to control their borders.\n\nThe rivalry between the two countries began to end as Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States also changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically. This change happened in the late 19th century.",

But as a child, I did not have a safe and secure life. I was told, \"You will always find work. People will always get sick.\" I wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead.\n\nEven so, at 46 years old, I was not working. I had no money and I could not work. To this day, I am still sick and I have been getting a small amount of money from the government for 15 years. I have nothing now. Every day is hard for me. I depend on my family and friends to help me.\n\nI know that life is hard. Sometimes big problems come and we cannot solve them alone. I agree that we should not rely on the government to solve all our problems. But we should help each other. We should be friendly and help our neighbors too.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism is good, but it is not the truth. Our ancestors who came to America did not cross the country alone.

            "We want to know why living things change over time. What rules are they following? Although a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said in 1917 that we do not know much about how simple living things are made, this is still true today. Recently, people are using math to learn about how mollusks, like clams, make their shells. Our study is trying to use math and experiments to understand why and how living things change.\n\nWe are studying a kind of shellfish called Prunum. We took pictures of Prunum shells using special X-rays. We used these pictures to make numbers that we can use in a computer program to make pictures of what Prunum shells might look like. These pictures can help us understand what shells can look like.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows over time. It turns as it grows, like a spiral staircase. This staircase has lines that separate each turn, called sutures. The last turn is the biggest. The part of the shell above the last turn is called the spire. The small end of the spire is called the apex. The other end is called the base. The animal lives in the shell through a small opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. One way is from the top, one way is from the bottom, and one way is from the side. The usual way to look at a shell is from the side, with the opening toward us.\n\nTo count the turns of the shell, we look at it from the top and find the first line that separates two turns. We draw a line from this point to divide the shell into two parts. Then, we count the turns from this line. We can also count the size of the turns.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal makes as it grows its shell. We can use math to find this path and understand how the shell grows. We can change the math to see how the shell would grow if it were different.",
            "The health of babies and young children in Indonesia is a big problem.  For the last ten years, it has not improved very much.  Indonesia is on track to meet some of the goals set by the United Nations, but it is not making progress in improving the health of women and children.  The reasons for this are many and need to be discussed.\n\nIn Indonesia, more and more babies are being born with a doctor or nurse present, which is good.  But many of these workers are not doctors and cannot help if there are problems during delivery.  This means that many women are still dying from complications during pregnancy.  The number of children with diarrhea who see a doctor is also decreasing.  We do not have much information about how well new mothers are being cared for after they give birth.\n\nFewer babies are being born by surgery, which is good.  But this is mostly happening in cities, not in rural areas.  This shows that people in the country are not having the same access to healthcare services as people in the cities.  The poor are having a hard time getting the healthcare they need, probably because they cannot afford it.\n\nSo the question now is: how can Indonesia make healthcare better for babies and mothers?  The biggest question is: should Indonesia create special programs to solve these problems or strengthen the whole healthcare system?  One way to solve the problems is to give extra help to one area, like prenatal care or after-birth care for the mother and baby.  This can be effective, but it also has some problems.  One problem is that it can take money away from other important areas of healthcare.  This can cause people who work in healthcare to focus on the area with the most money and resources.  Also, having too many programs can cause confusion and waste.",
            "Two Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions and focus on the rich people of that time. But two novels that are not like others from this period are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels have surprising and strange parts that help us understand the characters' thoughts and feelings.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the main character, Oliver, has strange thoughts and sees strange things. He hears two men arguing, Sikes and Crackit. They are loud and angry. Oliver is scared and confused. He sees and hears many strange things: loud noises, flashing lights, and people shouting. He feels a lot of pain.\n\nThe author uses strange events to show what is going on in Oliver's mind. These events often happen in his dreams or when he is feeling strange. When Oliver is shot, he relives the experience in his mind. He feels very scared and powerless. He does not have control over what happens to him.\n\nThe passage shows that Oliver has no control over his life. He is in a bad situation and cannot change it. This makes him feel defeated. He accepts his situation and cannot fight back.\n\nIn another novel, Wuthering Heights, the day is very long and very short. The sun does not shine. It is night and it is day at the same time. The silence is very scary and the time is very short.",
            "I worked with students at an after-school program a couple of years ago. I was a tutor for younger students, and my strengths were in English and reading. The program's instructor asked me to help a boy named Adrian, who was having trouble reading. At first, I thought something was wrong with him. Some letters he could read, but others not at all. It was strange. He spoke perfect English, but I thought maybe he was from a Spanish-speaking family. I tried to help him, but it was hard. Then, his mother came to visit. She only spoke Spanish. We used simple words, and I used what little Spanish I knew. I then understood his problem: he knew English, but he didn't know the alphabet well. I don't know if he got better, but I hope he did.\n\nI tell this story to show the problem of language barriers in schools. Even if students speak perfect English, they can still struggle to read. This is a big problem in California. Everyone agrees it's a problem, but what can we do? For Adrian, the answer was simple: more practice with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for other students who barely speak English, the answer is not clear. We need a combination of things: dual language systems, mainstream classes, private tutors, and English as a second language (ESL) classes.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It helps students who speak other languages and all students. Students in these programs do better in school. Some people are afraid of this idea. They think it's not worth the money and that most students won't benefit. But that's not true. If we make these programs a part of our schools, all students will benefit. So, how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's not realistic. But we can have special helpers who understand two languages.",

            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what Ian Watt calls it in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" Many people have looked down on the Gothic style, but others have praised it for its exciting and frightening parts. The original Gothic novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by Horace Walpole, combines old and new ideas to create a new way of writing. Walpole uses old theatrical elements and new ways of writing to create a \"Gothic Story.\"\n\nThe Gothic style uses many ideas from the past, like medieval theatre, buildings, and traditions. Even when Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" the word \"Gothic\" meant many different things. People thought it was old-fashioned and unsophisticated. The combination of old and new ideas makes the Gothic style last a long time and become new again to readers who are far from the original time.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is the idea of training a good knight. It is a medieval idea that is both kept and changed in the original Gothic novel. Chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it shows what a good knight should be like: brave, honorable, and able. Gothic writers saw that their society did not have these qualities. They used chivalry in their writing to make the past seem better and to try to improve the present.\n\nHorace Walpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" when things were not going well in his country. He was unhappy about the future. He might have thought that people in the past were better than people in his time. This is seen in the character of Frederic. Before we meet him, we know he has many chivalric qualities. He is a prince who has suffered and is supposed to be dead. He is described as a gallant and courteous knight, which is an exaggeration. This shows the Gothic idea of excess.\n\nThe Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. This is what makes it last a long time and become new again to readers who are far from the original time. The Gothic style uses many ideas from the past and combines them with new ways of writing to create a new way of telling stories.",
            "Supply chain management is the process of getting goods from the customer to the customer. It includes the stages of getting raw materials, making the product, and delivering it to the customer. The idea of supply chain management was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He said that supply chain management is planning, doing, and controlling all the things that happen to get the product to the customer quickly and efficiently. There are six important parts of a supply chain: making the product, getting the materials, keeping a stock of products, where the products are made, how the products are moved, and getting information about the products.\n\nThe first step in supply chain management is making the product. This is the start of the whole process. Making the product includes deciding when, why, where, and how to make it. Business managers need to know what the customers want. They can find out by looking at the market. The market shows them what the customers want and need. Once the managers know what the customers want, they decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and which factory is best for making them, based on the customer's needs.\n\nThe next step is to schedule work and take care of the machines. After that, the managers focus on getting the products to the customers. This is a very important part of the supply chain process. Every small detail is important, and if it is not planned well, it can cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run.\n\nFor example, at a big retail store like Wal-Mart or Target, there are special plans and rules for every part of the business. There is a plan for how the employees should look, how the products should be received from the trucks, and how the store should be run. This helps the company to work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nThe second important part of supply chain management is getting the materials and products. This includes deciding what the company can do itself and what it should get from other companies. A company may have many different parts that make a single product. The manager must decide which part is best for each step of making the product. The manager may also decide to work with other companies to make the product. The main reason for working with other companies is to make the product quickly and at a low cost.",

The sign says something that makes people think. Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of men with guns rule the country. They took power in 1962. In 2007, people in the street began to protest. The protests were the first in ten years. Many monks were leading the protests. The monks wear yellow robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution.\n\nAt first, the people in charge of the country let the monks hold meetings. But soon the government got angry and started to fight back. They hurt many people and destroyed many buildings. Journalists from other countries were arrested and imprisoned. A Japanese journalist was killed while he was covering the protests. The government said 13 people were killed, but a man who used to be in the army said many more people were killed.\n\nThis is not new. Many years ago, rulers wanted to have complete control over their people. Roman emperors said they had the right to make all the decisions. In Japan, the emperors are believed to be gods. They say they were sent to help people.\n\nIn the United States, the president has meetings with a man who leads a group called the Republican Party. Some examples of people being hurt by their rulers are the protests in China in 1989. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed, but others said 2,000-3,000 people were killed. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their skin color.

            "Duke Ellington was a famous musician. He made many great jazz pieces because he lived a long time and could keep creating new music. He often played the piano in his songs, but he was also a great composer. Ellington made music that showed off the special talents of each musician in his band. He created a framework where soloists could play freely and also wrote tightly organized parts that used each musician's style.\n\nEllington was a master at making the orchestra sound great together. He wrote music that was original and fit well with each piece. He knew how to use the sound of each musician and how they worked together to create new and exciting music.\n\nOne example of Ellington's work is the song \"Creole Love Call.\" It is a slow blues song with a call and response between voice and other instruments. The song starts with a smooth, melodic voice, then becomes rougher at the end. This shows Ellington's ability to mix different sounds and styles.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" the music is divided into six parts. Each part is different, but they all fit together well. The song has a muted trumpet solo that adds to the melody. A clarinet solo is also important, with a piano that plays a subtle, syncopated rhythm. The final part of the song returns to the call and response between voice and instruments.\n\nEllington's use of voice in his music is an important part of his style. In \"Creole Love Call,\" the voice is used like an instrument to add different colors and textures to the music. This is one way Ellington made his music special.\n\nIn another song, \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington uses his skill at organizing music and his ability to hear different sounds to create a rich and interesting sound. The song has a call and response between a trumpet player and a singer, creating a unique and complementary sound. Ellington also uses a trombone player to introduce a melody.\n\nEllington's music is full of new and exciting ideas. He was a master of using the sounds of each musician and making them work together to create something special. His music is still popular today and is considered some of the best jazz ever written.",

The researchers used a special score to measure how well the women followed the Mediterranean Diet.\n\nTo make the study more accurate, the researchers averaged the scores from the past two years to get a better idea of each woman's eating habits. They also controlled for factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, and physical activity.\n\nThe study found that women who ate a lot of Mediterranean diet foods were 29% less likely to have heart disease and stroke than women who did not follow the diet as well. This study shows that eating a healthy Mediterranean Diet can help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
            "In two thousand seven, the United States had a serious financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the housing market got worse. The economy was in trouble, and many large businesses were in bad shape. This problem is still happening today. We need to ask, how did this happen and how can we stop it?\n\nThe financial problem was caused by bad decisions made by politicians. They wanted banks to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was because the country wanted to help people who did not have enough money. But the banks did not have enough money to cover these loans. They sold these bad loans to other companies, and the problem spread.\n\nThe companies that sold these bad loans were called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They took these bad loans and made new investments called CDOs and CDSs. When people could not pay back the loans, the banks did not have enough money. The banks then gave the problem to the other companies that had bought the bad loans. This caused a big problem in the economy.\n\nThis problem started in nineteen ninety-nine. The President at that time, Bill Clinton, wanted to be re-elected. To do this, he made it easier for people to get loans. This made it easier for people to buy houses, but it also made the banks give out bad loans. A reporter named Steve Holmes wrote about this problem in nineteen ninety-nine. He said, \"Fannie Mae is giving out too many loans to people who cannot pay them back. This could cause big problems in the future.\"\n\nIndeed, many things worked together to make the economy worse. Banks gave out new kinds of loans that were hard to understand. These loans were called adjustable-rate mortgages and CDOs. They made the economy more connected to the housing market. This made people and banks borrow too much money, and they were not prepared for when the housing market went down.\n\nWhen the housing market went down, many banks had trouble. They had borrowed too much money and could not pay it back. The big banks in the United States had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This is a lot of money. In the end, some banks went out of business. The government had to take control of Fannie and Freddie, which had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans.",
            "Many writers know about exposition.  It's the part of a story where you tell the reader a lot of information at once.  This can make the reader bored or want to stop reading.  Dr. Merlin says that exposition is not your friend.\n\nYou already know the tip \"Show, don't tell.\"  But Dr. Merlin still makes this mistake.  Exposition is like a little devil that says to get the background out of the way so you can get to the good parts.\n\nExposition means saying what happened.  It's like a character telling another character a lot of information at once.  In fiction, the author does the telling.\n\nFor example, you read a story and are told that a woman met her husband at a certain time and place.  You're also told that he was murdered in front of her.  You would not expect this to take two pages, with not much happening during that time.  You would want to know more about the husband's character, how he loved his wife, and how she felt about him.  This would make you care about them and their story.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would give you more information about the heroine too.  You would understand why she loved him and how his death affected her.  You would be sad when he dies and care more about the heroine.\n\nAs a writer, you need to add more to the story.  It's easy to rush past some parts, but you should not.  You might introduce a new character and want to tell the reader a lot about him at once.  But you should not do this.  Instead, show the reader more about the character as the story goes on.\n\nFor example, you might tell the reader that a man used to be in the Air Force, is now a gas station manager, and has two ex-wives.  But you should not say he likes to fish on the weekends and dreams of owning the gas station.  Show this by what he says and does in the story.",
            "I saw two news programs from Columbus, Ohio, on the same day. The first one I saw was on NBC 4 in the morning. The lead story was a man in Ashley, Ohio, who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. The police arrested him. The newscaster showed his picture. He looked very bad. The news show talked about this story for only two minutes. I think it was enough time.\n\nThe next story was about a young man named Travis Buyers. He was 18 years old. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He is in the hospital. There are no arrests yet. The police are searching for the person who did this. This story was short. I think it might be because the police are still looking for the person who did it.\n\nI noticed something. When a white person is a victim, the news shows it a lot. But when a minority person is a victim, they do not show it as much. This is something I have noticed before.\n\nThe news also showed a story about a helicopter. A bullet hit it. The police are looking for the person who did it. They are offering money for information.\n\nThe news also talked about rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be warm.\n\nThe news also showed a story about a store that was robbed. The man who robbed it is black. He was wearing a hoodie. He is six feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. I think they showed his picture too much.\n\nThere was another story about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The news said 300 months instead of years. I am not sure why they said it like that.",
            "Brothers have a strong bond. It is not easy to break. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brothers. Brothers can see the good and bad in themselves when they look at their brothers. This bond can bring many strong feelings: love, pride, jealousy, and hurt. Brothers can only see themselves when they look at their brother.\n\nIn a book called \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers show what this bond can be like. They go on a hard journey through a beautiful and colorful place. They have strong feelings of pride and disappointment. One brother survives. \n\nThe main character's actions are guided by one strong feeling: pride. He wants a brother who can do things like run and jump. But his little brother, Doodle, cannot do these things. Doodle was born with a weak heart. He may not even live. This makes the brother very sad. He even thinks about hurting his brother. But when Doodle smiles, he feels love. His heart is not hard. He loves his brother.\n\nThis story shows that brothers can have strong feelings for each other. These feelings can be good or bad. But they are real. Brothers can only see themselves when they look at their brother. They can see their own feelings and actions.",
            "The brain is a very complex system that helps us think and learn. As technology has improved, people have used different ways to compare the brain to other things. At first, it was compared to a piece of wax, then to paper, then to a book, and now to a computer. Keep in mind that these comparisons are not very good and can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain starts to process information when it receives signals from our senses. These signals come from things like touch, heat, sound, or light. The brain changes this information into signals that can be understood. It does this in two ways: bottom-up and top-down. For example, when you look at a picture of a black box on a white background, the brain puts together simple information like color and shape to decide it's a box. Top-down processing helps you recognize the box faster by using the decisions made earlier.\n\nThe brain decides what information is important and what to do with it. For instance, when you look down at your shoes, you don't notice every blade of grass, but you might hear your name in a noisy room. There are many steps in the way the brain processes information, and attention helps at each step.\n\nFor the brain to work, it needs to store information. There are different types of memory, like sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain stores information in a special way. For example, when we hear words, the brain stores them in different ways, such as how they look, sound, or mean. When information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies show that working memory, which lasts about 20 seconds, is kept by a signal moving through some brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the structure of special proteins.\n\nThere are many ideas about how the brain organizes knowledge. Some are based on how people remember things, others are based on computers, and others are based on how the brain works. One idea, the semantic network, says that there are nodes representing ideas, and that the nodes are connected based on how they are related. For example, the word \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which can be connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley is critical of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He creates a world where people value their community above themselves and pursue happiness above all else. The people in this world are conditioned to obey one ideology and do not think for themselves. This is a commentary on the problems of the capitalist system.\n\nHuxley uses Marxist ideas to show his concerns about capitalism. He talks about how people are kept from knowing the truth about their place in society. This is called false consciousness. People are interested in their own gain and do not see the problems of the system. The World Controller controls the people and makes them think they are happy when they are really not.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are conditioned to want things they do not need. They are taught to spend and indulge. The different classes in society, like Delta and Gamma, do not have their own thoughts. They are controlled by the World Controller. The upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, are also controlled but do not do much to change the system.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have deep relationships. The characters are not very different from each other. Huxley may be saying that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and expression. Love and strong emotions do not exist in this world. People talk about each other's bodies and not about their feelings.\n\nThe people in Brave New World are very happy with their place in society. They do not try to change the system. This is like the Marxist idea of the proletariat, who are told they are better than others if they obey the rules. But Huxley is saying that this is not true.\n\nHuxley's ideas in Brave New World are a warning about the dangers of capitalism and technology. He wants people to think about the problems of the system and not just follow the rules.",
            "I am a student at University Park. It has been two and a half years since I came here. Getting around campus can be hard. My first year I lived in a dorm called East Halls. It is on the east side of campus. My classes were in the Willard building, near the center of campus. It took 25 minutes to walk to class. Sometimes it took longer because of the weather.\n\nThe East Halls dorms used to be far from the rest of the campus. Now it is not so far. New buildings and apartments have been added to the area. The campus is getting bigger. It is harder to get from one place to another.\n\nA good way to solve this problem is to use a bicycle. But bicycles alone are not enough. Students need to ride them and the campus needs to be built for people who ride bikes.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said that riding a bike is a great way to get around. It is good for the body and it is fast. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. I ride my bike to class every day. The ride is 25 minutes on foot, but 5 minutes on a bike. The road I ride on is not easy to travel. But I have no choice. If I did not have a bike, I would have to walk. Walking would take too long. It would take over 2 hours every week. I do not have that much time."
