            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at two ways people understand the problem of not sleeping well. One way is called the biological model. This model looks at how genes and the body affect sleep. It also looks at sicknesses that can cause problems with sleep. The other way is called the sociocultural model. This model looks at how the world around us and our life situations affect sleep.\n\nThe biological model focuses on genetic information that we get from our parents and medical problems that can affect sleep. Scientists have found that special cells in the brain called neurons help us sleep and wake up. These neurons have a special helper that is important for sleep. If this helper is not working right, it can be hard to sleep.\n\nOne study found that mice that were given a special medicine that helped this helper sleep more. This study shows that the body's helpers for sleep can be important for getting a good night's sleep. If these helpers are not working right, it can be hard to sleep without medicine. This study can help us understand why some people have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the world around us and our life situations affect sleep. This model looks at things like our family, friends, and where we live. It also looks at how our life situations, such as our job and money, can affect sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model is important because it shows that our surroundings and life situations can affect our sleep. For example, if we are stressed or anxious, it can be hard to sleep. If we have a hard time sleeping, it can affect our daily life and our ability to do things we need to do.\n\nThis paper will look at research that helps us understand the biological and sociocultural models of not sleeping well. We will look at the strengths and weaknesses of this research and how it can help us understand the problem of not sleeping well.\n\nInsomnia is a problem that can be caused by different things.

            "This paper will explain Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. We will look at the definition, how to identify the problem, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in the classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses sound. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brains do not work well with what they hear. The brain has trouble separating sounds and understanding speech when there is noise around. \n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Back then, it was called \"auditory imperception.\" Scientists were trying to understand children with communication problems. They started making tests to help identify these problems in 1954. In 1961, a scientist named Kimura created a model to explain how our brains work with sound.\n\nCAPD shows itself in different ways. A person with CAPD may have trouble locating where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two sounds at the same time. They may not be able to understand sound patterns or changes in speech. They may have trouble understanding sarcasm or jokes because of changes in voice. Sometimes, a loud sound can block out a softer sound. They may have trouble putting together sound clues to make sense of things. And they may have trouble understanding the order of things they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, a doctor or therapist will watch how they listen and act. They may also give them tests to see how they do with sound. These tests can include asking questions, watching how they respond to different sounds, and looking at how well they can understand speech. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nTeachers in a classroom can help students with CAPD by giving them extra help and understanding. They can also make changes in the classroom to make it easier for the student to learn.",

The Germans had done a good job of helping Africans learn. But in another colony, South West Africa (now Namibia), the situation was very different. The government did not help the Africans learn as much. Instead, missionary groups helped, but they did not get much help from the government. The government, however, spent a lot of money to help the Europeans learn.\n\nThe government built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools a lot. This had a big effect on South West Africa long after the Germans were gone. Many Africans in other German colonies were educated and could read and write. But in South West Africa, the majority of the people were not educated.\n\nThere are many books about education in the German colonies. Most of these books are in German and were written a long time ago. Some of these books just described the education systems in the colonies. Later, more writers compared the education systems in the different colonies. They found many differences. One writer, Cohen, compared the education systems in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of European settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the differences.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but a lot of the land was desert. The number of European settlers in South West Africa was not as high as in other colonies. By 1913, there were about 15,000 Europeans living in South West Africa. This was more than in East Africa, where the next largest number of settlers lived.",
            "Heavy Metal Music - A Special Kind of Sound\n\nHeavy Metal music has changed a lot over the past 100 years. It is now many different kinds, and some are very hard to understand. When Heavy Metal first started, it was a new kind of music that was different from others. It was loud and had a lot of strong feelings, mostly sad or angry. Many people started to make their own kinds of Heavy Metal music. This led to many new kinds of Heavy Metal, and the types of music kept growing.\n\nToday, there are many kinds of Heavy Metal music. It has ideas from other kinds of music and has become very different. To understand Heavy Metal music, we need to know what it is and where it came from.\n\nHeavy Metal is music that is often about dark feelings. It is loud, strong, and has a lot of energy. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at their jobs. They show this in their music. Heavy Metal music also often talks about using drugs to get new ideas. Many people made Heavy Metal music in the 1970s using these drugs. They wanted to make music that was different and new. Heavy Metal music also talks about feelings that are hard to deal with, like sadness and pain. This was new in music because most music at that time was happy.\n\nSome people think that Heavy Metal music started with the Beatles. They made a song called Helter Skelter that was very loud and had strong feelings. It was like this song to show that the Beatles could make music that was as loud and strong as the Rolling Stones. The song is on the Beatles' White Album.",
            "A French artist named Henri Rousseau painted a famous picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy and amazed by the beautiful things around her. But The Dream also shows Rousseau's own dreams and wishes as an artist. Rousseau wanted many things: he wanted to be famous, to be accepted by other artists, and to get praise for his work. But he had a big problem: he wanted to be an original artist, but he also wanted to be like other famous artists. This made him very unhappy.\n\nTo understand his painting, we need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a businessman and they had a good life. Rousseau did not go to art school, but he worked for the government for many years. He was a toll collector and people called him a customs inspector. When his first wife died, he was very sad. He had eight babies, but all of them died. He had one daughter left. He wanted a new life and painting helped him to feel better. Rousseau's paintings are not like the paintings of other famous artists. They are like the paintings of ordinary people.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous, but it was hard for him. Many other artists were famous and they started painting when they were young. Rousseau started painting when he was old and he was not well-known until many years later. When someone else became famous, a man named Matisse, Rousseau was still not well-known. But Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a special way, but Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was easy to understand and that people would like. He wanted to be accepted by the art world.",
            "Many people believe that people who think about ethics and art have a close connection. They think that truth and beauty are connected. I agree with this. As the poet John Keats says, “Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty.” This is all you need to know. We learn many things in life, but we also like ethics and art without being taught. Both ethics and art try to explain things, but not to tell us what to do. We try to say why something is good or beautiful, not how to make it good or beautiful.\n\nWhen we talk about art, we use words like \"good\" and \"beautiful.\" But saying these words does not explain why something is good or beautiful. For example, people may talk about the famous painting \"Mona Lisa\" by da Vinci. They may say it is good because of its colors or its history. But saying these things does not tell us why it is good. When we talk about our favorite art or story, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This means there is something more than words can say.\n\nI believe that art and ethics are like this. They are hard to explain. As the writer Flannery O'Connor says, “You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” This means that sometimes we need to use stories to say things that cannot be said in words. I think ethics is like this too. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein says, “Ethics cannot be expressed. It is transcendental.”\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because we experience them in the same way. We experience them at a deep level, but they are hard to explain. This is true for art, but especially for literature. Literature is a special kind of art that talks about values. Values are important for living. Literature is important to us because it teaches us values.",
            "Germany is a strong country with a unique culture. This culture comes from different parts of the country. It can be seen from the mountains in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. The same culture is felt in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many groups of people lived there a long time ago. They were called Germanic tribes. The name \"German\" comes from a group called the Tungrians. Some people think the name also comes from the word \"ger,\" which means a spear. Others think it comes from the word \"garim,\" which means to shout or make a loud noise.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said they were an original people and did not come from other places. He said they lived in a wild and cold country, far from the Roman Empire. Tacitus also said the Germans traded with the Romans and sometimes fought against them.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany, but they sent their soldiers to the country to get goods. The Germanic tribes also served in the Roman army. They traded goods and skills with the Romans, but they remained on the borders of the Roman Empire.",
            "I looked down at the toilet. My mind was not working well. I was thinking, but my thoughts were not connected. I was not feeling anything. I was looking at the toilet, but I was not thinking about it. \n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw. I wanted to draw pictures since I was six years old. An artist I worked with told me to try a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The book teaches how to draw. It teaches how the brain works when we look at lines and shapes. \n\nThe book says to draw a square around the picture you want to draw. This helps you see the picture better. But when I looked at the toilet, I could not think of a square. I was too busy looking at the toilet. \n\nI thought about artists like Picasso. He liked the color blue. Monet liked green. But I was not thinking about colors. I was thinking about the toilet. \n\nMy hand was on the toilet handle. I turned the handle. But nothing happened. The toilet was not flushing. I was frustrated. I had to flush the toilet. I gripped the mop and tried again. The toilet still did not flush. I was getting angry. \n\nI was staring at the toilet. It was full of brown water. I did not want to touch it. But I had to. I had to get the mop into the toilet. I gripped the toilet paper holder with my other hand and leaned in. I was trying to be careful. I did not want to touch the yucky water. \n\nI dipped the mop into the toilet. It was not easy. I had to be careful not to get my hand wet. I was thinking about the book. I was thinking about drawing. But I was also thinking about the toilet. It was not a nice thought.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several reasons make this a big problem. The National Institutes of Health say the brain of a teenager is not ready for the dangers of driving. Driving without experience is also a problem. Many inexperienced drivers cause more accidents, and they crash more often. They also drive too fast and leave the road.\n\nTeenagers are more likely to crash when they drive with friends. A study in Southern California found that the age of the passenger is linked to the number of accidents. \n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teenagers by requiring special licenses that limit the hours they drive and do not allow other minors in the car.\n\nBut I think these special licenses are not enough. The real problem is that teenagers are not ready to handle the dangers of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He says teenagers often like to take risks for the fun of it. This is why we should not give driver's licenses to young teens. If we do, the number of accidents and deaths will keep going up. By 2010, there will be many more young drivers on the road.\n\nSimple rules could help solve this problem. Schools could teach driving classes, but no one under 18 could drive. A special permit could still be given before a full license. Students would need to practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours required could be the same as in most states. This would help keep teenagers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a good way to protect young drivers.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. They have many old films made by Thomas Edison. I wanted to watch all of the films that were tricks. There were fifteen of these films from 1895 to 1901. These films often use editing to make illusions. I studied these films to learn how they use creative editing. I also wanted to see how some of the later films were different.\n\nMost of these trick films were made on a small stage. They used a special framework called a proscenium. The camera did not move. It stayed in one place. The filmmakers used long shots and medium shots. This was common in early films. It came from the way theatre and magic shows were done. \n\nOne thing that is clear is that the actors in these films can only move side to side. They cannot walk towards or away from the camera. In the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors come in from one side and move back and forth. They go out of the frame, but the camera does not follow.\n\nThese trick films often use long shots or medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. It is like watching a play or a magic show. You see the whole performance at once.\n\nMost of these early trick films have only one shot. This limits the length of the film. It is usually short, about a minute. The films often show simple tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, sometimes one shot can be made up of many different parts. This can create an illusion of something disappearing or appearing. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). You can see when the \"head\" of Mary is shown, even though the whole film is one shot.",
            "One American man was very important to the early United States. His name was John Taylor. He was a farmer and a politician. He was dedicated to his work and spoke his mind. Taylor believed in freedom for everyone. He thought farming was the best way to live. His ideas about government were based on his love of farming.\n\nTaylor thought the United States was special because it had no old traditions to follow. This meant the country could create a fair government. He believed all people have rights that should not be taken away by the government. He said if one right is taken away, all rights are at risk.\n\nTaylor believed in a system of good and evil. He thought governments have the same good and bad qualities as people. He said a good government protects private property and helps farmers. He also believed in fairness and did not like capitalism. He thought a fair government would work well, even if the people in charge are not fair.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that follows the Constitution exactly. He did not want the government to have too much power. He thought a big government would be expensive and unfair. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution was not enough. He believed the writers of the Constitution had a plan, and we should follow it.\n\nTaylor liked the Declaration of Independence more than the Constitution. He thought it said the United States is made up of many independent states, not just one country.",
            "The number of people filling out commuter logs was very low in the third month of the project. This was a problem and hard to understand. There was a big drop in the number of people commuting by bicycle or on foot in the winter. December was a very busy time on campus. Many students and teachers were finishing their schoolwork and preparing for grades. They may not have had time to fill out the commuter log. There was also a holiday break in December. Many people did not have to come to campus. Classes did not start again until late January. But even this did not explain why so few people filled out the log in February.\n\nWe thought that a big project like this might have a lot of excitement at first, but then the interest would decrease. We wanted to keep people involved. We made a special project called Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a big effort to keep people interested. It did work and more people filled out the log that month.\n\nOne problem with this project was that people like to drive their cars. This is a part of American culture. We gave prizes to people who used alternative ways to commute. We gave gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. This was very helpful. But we thought it would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would have helped. For example, a new bicycle or a new car could have made people more interested.\n\nThe prizes we gave out did not change much during the project. We thought it would be better to increase the prizes as the project went on. This might have kept people more interested. The gift cards were good at first, but if we had announced that we would give a new bicycle or a new car later, many more people might have filled out the log.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. But an ETF is more flexible and trades like a stock. \n\nAn ETF gives you the benefits of an index fund and the benefits of owning one stock. These benefits include the ability to sell the stock quickly, buy more stock with borrowed money, and buy as little as one share. The fees of ETFs are much lower than those of most mutual funds. \n\nHowever, there are some downsides. You must pay a fee for each trade like you would for a stock. Many ETFs are available. It is smart to check if the benefits of an ETF are true and how much they are true. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if the benefits of owning one ETF are the same as owning a group of 10 stocks. We will also see if there is a better way to own these stocks. \n\nTo make this easier, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and their share of the ETF.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can look at how they would do if they made up a portfolio on their own. We will use a chart to show the results.\n\nThe chart shows that the 10 stocks make up a portfolio that is 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in returns. The chart also shows that the 10 stocks have a lower risk level, or Beta, than the ETF. \n\nThis means that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with less risk. But we must be sure that these results are true and not just a chance. \n\nTo do this, we will look at the risk level of each stock. We will compare the risk level of the 10 stocks to the risk level of the ETF. If they are different, we will say they are statistically different.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land.\" Some people think \"Dream-Land\" is one of Poe's best poems. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in two parts of the poem. He got this word from an old writer named Virgil.\n\nVirgil used the word \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the end of the world. But Poe got the word from another writer. Poe liked reading German writers.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew about the German writer Goethe. Goethe was a famous writer of poetic plays. One of his plays is called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king whose wife dies. The king is very sad and starts drinking. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. Then he goes to a cliff, throws a goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" is similar to the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" They both feel sad and alone. Maybe Poe used \"Thulé\" as a way to show his own sadness. Goethe's \"Faust\" was made into a play in 1842. This was just before Poe wrote about Thulé in another poem. Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" The poem is about a dark and lonely place. The speaker is haunted by his dead friends and sees a world without color. This is similar to the king in \"The King of Thulé,\" who has lost his wife and his will to live.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known about. Poe said he admired another writer named Tennyson. Poe would have learned about Goethe from his work or from reproductions of his writing.",
            "If a customer at a grocery store in California slips and falls on spilled applesauce, can the customer get extra money as punishment from the store? This extra money is called punitive damages. The customer, Jennifer Palmer, claims the store manager acted very badly. She says he was told about the spill twice but did nothing about it because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to throw out Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To get this kind of damages, the customer must show that the store manager acted on purpose and with a complete disregard for the harm that could happen. Jennifer Palmer can say that the store manager should have known about the danger because many other customers had slipped and fallen on the same issue in the past. The manager still did nothing. Jennifer Palmer can also say that the manager's behavior was very bad because he ignored the problem even though it had happened many times before.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee of the store told the manager about the spill. The manager said he was busy eating and did not have time to help. Fifteen minutes later, another employee told the manager about the spill, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell and got hurt. Before that, five other customers had slipped and fallen in the same store in 2009.\n\nJennifer Palmer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury and for extra money as punishment. We are thinking about asking the judge to throw out the part of the lawsuit that asks for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a person can get punitive damages if someone breaks a rule that is not part of a contract. The rule says that someone can get punitive damages if the person acted with evil or was very mean and showed a complete disregard for the safety of others. The court has said that someone acts with malice when they are aware of the danger and do nothing to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC. A big question in class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is even more important today. Looking back on events since 9/11, I have seen how the media view Islam changed. In 2001, it was mostly negative. Today, it is very accepting of Islam in America. Now we have a president named Barack Obama, whose family has Muslim background.\n\nThe story of the Prophet is interesting to me. It says Muhammad was a kind and humble man. This is different from what I thought I knew about him. I thought he made people join Islam by force. He would conquer cities and make people follow Islam. But the story says Muhammad was a hero who was misunderstood. People saw the good in him and wanted to learn from him.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the actions of Muhammad. One example is when he made food multiply to feed many people. This makes me think the writers wanted us to see Muhammad as a great teacher who didn't need to prove himself. They wanted us to see that he was a man of truth and miracles. This is dishonest because it takes away from the special story of Jesus Christ. It's like they are taking credit for Jesus' work.\n\nSome stories in the biography seem to be about proving that many people converted to Islam on their own. But these stories are not direct. They tell us what someone else heard from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true. I don't like this because it makes the story seem suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the biography makes Muhammad seem like a perfect man. It says he was kind and gentle. But history says he was not. I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus were not followed by his followers after he died.  A movement of Christian thought happened after his death.  This movement moved away from Jesus' ideas.  If we look at this history, we see that Christianity has changed a lot over time.  It has moved away from its start.  Today, people are starting to think differently.  Many people are aware of this change and want to know more.  Some people still believe in the old teachings.  They will not change their minds.  But they may not be able to stop the change.  Many Christians will learn more about the past.  This will make them want to go back to the original ideas of Jesus.  This will take a long time, maybe even centuries.  But it will happen.  There will be a time when Christians go back to the original teachings of Jesus.  A movement will grow and people will remove the extra teachings that were added over time.  This will make Christianity like it was when Jesus lived.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas.  The church will remain strong to lead the way.  But the church will not be the same.  People will think and believe the same way.  There will be less difference between different groups of Christians.  This has happened before.  A long time ago, Christians were persecuted.  Then they became the rulers.  Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly.  Now they have leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the start and forget the extra teachings.\n\nIf we look back in time, we see that there was only one kind of Jewish religion.  But over time, the Jewish people divided into groups.  These groups were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and many ordinary people.  They did not agree with each other.  They had different ideas about God.",
            "The Jungle shows how people are naturally selfish. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The main factory owners and managers are very greedy. They want to make their businesses big and strong, but they do not think about people or animals who might be hurt. They do not care about the pollution from their factories or the dirty water and air.\n\nThe factory owners do not care about their workers. They want to make more money, so they make their workers work very long hours. They can lay off many workers at any time without giving them anything. There were no laws to protect workers in those days. The factory owners could do what they wanted. They made their workers work in bad conditions. People who worked in the factories were treated very badly. They were living in very poor conditions and had no help. Unions were formed to help workers, but they often made money from the workers instead of helping them. Workers had no way to get out of this bad situation. They were like slaves. Many workers were poor and hungry, and they had to ask for help from the factory owners. This made immorality common.\n\nThis book, The Jungle, shows how people are treated unfairly. It shows how some people are very cruel and only care about themselves. The author, Upton Sinclair, wants to show us the problems that exist in the world.",
            "Some authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. They use many techniques. Some are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He uses a special way of combining words to give readers a certain feeling. Sometimes, he pairs an adjective and a noun that do not usually go together. This creates a special meaning around a subject. \n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with colors. He gives meaning to many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red. In The Great Gatsby, he creates meaning for white and gray. White is nice and high class. Gray is old and faded. Fitzgerald starts to use these meanings in the beginning of the novel. \n\nIn the beginning, everyone wears white. The rich characters, like Daisy and Jordan, wear white. Nick wears white flannel to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt. Even houses are white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting an impression of Gatsby's party. But even then, the colors are bright and not white. \n\nFitzgerald uses the colors to describe many everyday things. He makes some people and places seem unimportant by using the colors white and gray. He describes Jordan and Daisy's childhood as a \"white girlhood\". He says there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes. He describes an old man as gray. \n\nAfter creating these meanings, Fitzgerald uses the colors to show that some subjects are unimportant. He uses the colors to describe Daisy. He says she is dressed in white in a white car. Fitzgerald uses this technique again and again to show that Daisy is just a uniform addition. He says Daisy's fur collar is gray and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's meeting. \n\nFitzgerald uses colors in a special way to give readers a certain feeling about important objects and people. He creates meaning for colors and then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling.",
            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The weather is nice and sunny. Many crops grow well there, like tomatoes, citrus fruits, lettuce, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a big market for organic food in the San Diego area. Many people want to buy food from local farms. Some farms in the area offer tours and allow people to walk around and enjoy nature.\n\nOrganic farming helps the environment. It makes the area better for plants and animals. But it can be more difficult and costly than other ways of farming. Organic farmers need to work harder to keep pests and weeds away and make the soil healthy. They also need to spend more time and money.\n\nThe land in question is in a good place for this kind of farming. It is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County. The land is 160 acres and has chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is near a big forest and is home to many animals, some of which are in danger.\n\nPeople have lived on this land for a long time. Native Americans were there first, and then some people came to raise cattle and sell wood. The land was used for these things for many years.\n\nI found a real farm in the area that is doing this kind of farming. I used this farm as an example to see what kind of help a small farmer might need to make their farm successful and good for the environment.",
            "Culture is important in any discussion. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not the same for everyone. It can be hard to understand. Culture is not one thing. It is not the same everywhere. We should not say that all people from one place are the same. For example, we should not say that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are polite.\n\nIt is better to understand the culture that is important for the discussion. We should know how the culture feels about the issue. We should know how the culture will affect the talk. When we talk to people from another culture, we think about our own culture. We compare them to our own culture. This can be helpful.\n\nTo understand a different culture, we can learn about its history. We can learn about its ideas. We can learn about its prejudices. We should not judge another culture. We should accept it as it is. We should work with the culture, not against it. Especially, if we are in a weak position.\n\nIn a company, there is a company culture. The company culture is not the same as the national culture. A company culture can be strict or relaxed. A company may like employees to dress a certain way. A company may like employees to communicate in a certain way. A company may like employees to give to charities. Companies in the same country can be very different.\n\nValues are important because they tell us why people behave in certain ways. If people value saving face, they will not make their company or boss look bad. If people value a strong bargain, they will not give in easily. We should know these values before we talk to people from another culture.\n\nIt is also good to know the person we are talking to. This can help us talk to them more effectively. We should learn about the person's values and culture. This can help us get what we want.",
            "A famous Bible quote says, “The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This quote is in the Christian Bible and is used by a famous thinker, St. Anselm. We will look at the ideas of St. Anselm and another thinker, Thomas Aquinas. They both believe in the existence of God. We will compare their ideas.\n\nLet us start with the idea of St. Anselm. He thinks that we can find God inside our minds. We all know that God exists, he says. We can see this in our own thoughts. We do not need to look outside for proof. This idea is called faith. Faith means believing in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can find God by using reason and evidence. We do not need faith to believe in God. He gives five reasons for believing in God: change, cause, an uncertain world, levels of good things, and harmony. He says that these reasons show that God must exist.\n\nWe can compare these ideas. St. Anselm’s idea is based on faith. Thomas Aquinas’ idea is based on reason and evidence. We will look at these ideas to see which one is better.",
            "A long time ago, in a place called India, a famous man named Siddhartha was born. He was later known as the Buddha. He gave up his life of wealth and power to find a better way. After many years of study and hard work, he became a wise teacher. His ideas caused many people to start the religion of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is now more than 2,500 years old. But it has changed over time. This can be seen in a country called Sri Lanka. The people there celebrate a big festival every year. They cut down a tree to start the festival. The monks and laypeople participate, but the Buddha never taught about this festival. This is just one example of how Buddhism has changed. There are also changes in the rules and ideas of the religion.\n\nThese changes can be caused by both friends and enemies. Friends are people who are part of the Buddhist group. Enemies are people who do not like Buddhism. Sometimes friends can change Buddhism in bad ways. Sometimes enemies try to hurt Buddhism.\n\nWe need to know some words to understand this discussion. A friend can be a monk or a layperson. A friend is a person who is part of the Buddhist group. An enemy is a person who is not a Buddhist. A bad enemy is a person who wants to hurt Buddhism. A good enemy is a person who does not want to hurt Buddhism but may cause problems anyway.\n\nNow, let's learn about the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a big book of Buddhist texts. It is divided into three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for monks and laypeople. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and life.\n\nSome important ideas in Buddhism are no soul, suffering, and change. Everything in life is impermanent. If we understand these ideas, we can end the cycle of life and death. We can also end desire, hatred, and confusion. These ideas are like the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry was a big problem for both countries. The Mexican-American War was the most important event in this rivalry. The United States won the war and took Texas and the American Southwest from Mexico in 1848.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many disagreements about important things like religion, culture, and money. These disagreements helped create a strong dislike between the two countries. Many other nations with a shared border have similar problems and rivalries.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not alone in having a long rivalry with a neighbor. This is common in countries that share a border. The United States has had long-standing problems with Mexico and Cuba. These countries are close to the United States and have had rivalries with it for a long time.\n\nOne of the big issues between the United States and Mexico was about different religions. The United States did not want to be ruled by a king or have the Catholic Church in charge. This was also true in the past with the English and Spanish. \n\nThe United States and Mexico had 17 big disagreements during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these were about border problems. The United States and Mexico used military force to control their borders and stop bandits and outlaws from crossing. \n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico started to get better as Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States' goals changed from taking land to helping Mexico's economy. This change helped end the rivalry.",
            "I became very sick fifteen years ago. I had no idea I was going to get sick. I was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted security and safety. When I was a child, I did not have these things.\n\nA nurse always has a job. People will always get sick. This was what I was told when I grew up. So, I chose to be a nurse instead of being a scientist or a journalist.\n\nBut here I am. I am 46 years old and alone. I have no money. I cannot work. I am still sick. I have been on disability for fifteen years. I have no money left.\n\nEvery day is hard for me. I need help from my family and friends. I am lucky to have them. When bad things happen, you feel weak. You do not feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen to anyone. We cannot always prepare for them. We need to help each other. We need to trust each other.\n\nSome people in the United States think we should not depend on the government. But I think we should help each other more. We should help those who need it.\n\nOur ancestors came to America because they had help from their neighbors. They did not come alone. They worked together. We should do the same.\n\nYes, we should be prepared. I have a disaster kit. I have things to help me if I am hurt. I have food and water. But we should also help each other. We should know our neighbors.\n\nGet to know the people who live near you. This is very important.",
            "Many things happen in nature because of evolution. This is the process of change in living things over many years. People are still trying to understand how and why this change happens. Even in the year nineteen seventeen, biologist D'Arcy Thompson said that scientists have not yet found an easy way to describe how living things are made. Today, scientists are using math to learn about how some animals build their shells.\n\nWe are studying how one type of animal builds its shell. This animal is called Prunum. We are using math to help us understand how the shell changes over time. We also studied the animal's shell in different ways. We took pictures of the animal's shell from the inside using X-rays. We used these pictures to make a list of things that describe the shape of the shell. We then put these things into a computer program. This program helps us understand how the shell might change over time.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that grows over time. The shell grows in a spiral way, like a big coil. This coil is made up of many turns, or whorls. The center of the shell is called the columella. The whorls grow at different rates. A line separates each whorl and is called a suture. The biggest whorl is called the body whorl. The rest of the whorls are called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the front, and from the back. The most common way to look at a shell is from the front, with the opening facing us.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we look at the top of the shell. We find the first line that separates the whorls. We draw a line across the shell at this point. We then count the whorls from this line. We can count them in parts of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a path that the animal follows as it grows. The path is made up of many points, or coordinates. We can use math to describe this path. We can also use math to change the way the shell grows. This helps us understand how the animal builds its shell.",
            "In Indonesia, many babies and young children die. Their deaths do not stop. The country is trying to meet goals set by the world to help the poor. But Indonesia is not doing well in helping mothers and children stay healthy. The country is not improving as fast as it should.\n\nIndonesia is making progress in getting health workers at births. Now 72 percent of births have a health worker. But this is not always a good thing. It includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot help if the baby is sick. This is why many mothers die from bleeding during birth.\n\nMore children are not getting medical help when they are sick with diarrhea. We do not have good information on how many mothers get good care after they have a baby. But we know that mothers in Indonesia do not get good care.\n\nNot enough mothers have a cesarean section, a type of surgery. Only 4 percent of mothers have this surgery. And it is worse in rural areas. In cities, 7 percent of mothers have a cesarean section, but in rural areas, it is only 2 percent. This is a problem because it means some mothers do not get good care. It also means that some mothers are not treated fairly. The rich have better access to good healthcare.\n\nThe problem is that not everyone has access to good healthcare. The poor have a hard time getting medical help. They often have to pay money to get help. And they have to pay a lot if they go to the hospital.\n\nThe next step is to fix the lack of healthcare. There are two ways to do this. We can make specific programs to help mothers and children. Or we can make the healthcare system better. The system is like a big machine. If we fix the machine, it will help all parts of the system. \n\nOne way to help mothers and children is to make programs that target one area. These programs can give good results fast. But there are some problems. If we spend a lot of money on one program, we might not have enough for other programs. And if we have many programs, they might not work well together.",
            "Two novels from the Victorian period are not like other novels from this time. They are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These stories have mystery and are a little strange. They help us understand the characters. We see their feelings and reasons for doing things.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to the main character. These strange things help us know what is going on inside Oliver's mind. For example, he remembers a shooting in his mind. This shooting makes Oliver very sad and scared. He feels pain and has no control over what is happening to him.\n\nOliver Twist uses dreams to show us what the main character is feeling. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers the shooting again. This time it feels like a dream. Oliver is very sad and helpless. He cannot change what happened. He is in a lot of pain and is very scared. This shows that Oliver does not have control over his life.\n\nOliver Twist also shows that Oliver is very sad and defeated. He feels like he cannot do anything. It is like someone, like Fagin, is controlling him and making him feel this way.\n\nAnother example of a strange and dreamlike scene is from Wuthering Heights. It says: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"\n\nThis passage describes a long and quiet night. It is like a dream. The writer uses this kind of scene to show how the characters are feeling. It helps us understand their emotions and thoughts.\n\nBoth Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are different from other novels from the Victorian period. They use strange and dreamlike scenes to show us the characters' feelings and thoughts. This makes the characters more interesting and helps us understand them better.",
            "I worked in a program for children after school. I helped students with their homework. My strengths were in English and reading. I worked with a teacher to help a boy named Adrian. He was having a hard time reading. I thought he had a problem. Some letters he could read, but others he could not. It was strange. Adrian spoke perfect English, but I thought he was from a different country. His mother came to the program one day. She did not speak English. We used my bad Spanish to talk. I understood that Adrian did not know the English alphabet. He could read, but he did not know how to read in English.\n\nI tell this story to talk about a problem in schools. Many students have trouble with language. I want to show that it is not always easy to see the problem. Adrian spoke good English, but he still had a problem.\n\nThis is a big problem in California and other places. What can we do? One answer is to help students with reading in English. But for students who do not speak much English, it is harder. We need a good plan.\n\nOne good part of a plan is dual language programs. This means teaching students in two languages. It is good for students who speak a different language at home. But it is also good for all students. Students in these programs do better in school.\n\nSome people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But it is not true. If we use this idea in all schools, all students will benefit. How can we do this? We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. But we can use helpers who speak two languages.\n\nWe can use special helpers in the classroom. They can be tutors or aids. They can help students who need it. This is a good way to help students who have trouble with language.\n\nWe can also use other ideas. We can have English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. These classes can help students learn English. We can also use private tutors. These people can help students one-on-one.\n\nThe key is to use all of these ideas together. We should not use just one idea. We should use many ideas to help students who have trouble with language.",
            "We learn early in life that there is something bigger than us. Some people go to church to learn about it, while others go to a special place called a temple. Some look inside themselves for answers. We often accept the religions our parents believe in. But some of us do not believe. We may change our ideas about what is important. We look for our own path in life.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. We sat on our porch together during the rain. The rain made the plants on the porch wet. My father looked out into the rain. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and did not know what to say. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out at the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December. I was twenty-two years old. He was sick for a long time. The doctors kept him alive, but it was hard for him. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember him when he was alive, not when he was sick. I thought my dad would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days. I was very sad.\n\nI thought about God. I did not know if God was real. If God was real, I thought he was not listening to me. I said no prayers at night. I was angry. I wanted to remember my father, not how he died. I wanted to think about how he lived.",
            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt says this in his book, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" People see the Gothic style as a mix of good and bad things. Some say it is not real, while others say it is great. The Gothic style has its roots in old stories and ideas. Horace Walpole's book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" is the first Gothic Novel. It combines old traditions and new ideas to create a new way of writing.\n\nWalpole uses old-fashioned stories and new ideas to make a new kind of story. He says it is a \"Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style uses ideas from the Middle Ages, like old buildings and old customs. Many people thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned and not smart. They thought it was not as good as new ideas and ways of writing.\n\nThe Gothic style is a mix of old and new ideas. It combines old stories and traditions with new ways of writing. This is why it lasts a long time and is new to people who read it a long time after it was written.\n\nOne idea that is important in Gothic stories is the idea of chivalry. Chivalry is a way of training a knight to be brave and honorable. The idea of chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it represents a good knight who is brave and honest. Gothic writers used chivalry to show what was missing in society. They wanted to make the past seem better than the present.\n\nThe writer of \"The Castle of Otranto\" was living in a time when there was a lot of trouble in the world. He was unhappy about the future. He wanted to show that the past was better than the present. He used the idea of chivalry to make the past seem ideal and romantic. He wanted to make people think that the past was better than the present.\n\nIn \"The Castle of Otranto,\" there is a character named Frederic. He is a prince who has suffered a lot. He has many qualities of a chivalrous knight. He is brave, kind, and honest. The writer uses Frederic to show what a good knight should be like. Frederic is an example of the Gothic trope of excess, which means being too good to be true.",
            "A supply chain is a flow of things. It includes the steps from getting raw materials to making and delivering products to customers. This idea was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He explained how to plan, make, and control the supply chain to meet customers' needs quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: making things, getting supplies, storing products, finding a place, moving things, and sharing information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nMaking things is the first step. It is the base of the supply chain. It says when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can find this out by looking at the market. The market is a good sign of what customers want.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many. Then they choose where to make the products and which factory will be best. This is based on the customer's needs and satisfaction. Next, managers plan the work and take care of the equipment.\n\nMaking things is a very important step. Every detail is very important. If details are not planned well, it can cost a company a lot of time and money. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of the business. This plan shows how employees should look, how to get products from trucks, and more. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly.\n\nThe second key part is getting supplies. This means making strategic decisions to decide what a company can do well. A company may have many groups making the same product. Each group has different equipment and workers. The manager chooses which group is best for each step of making the product. Managers may also decide to work with other companies to make things better.\n\nA manager might choose to work with another company to make things faster and cheaper. This is called velocity. It means making good products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "A sign on a street corner in Burma says Hitler is alive.\n\nActress Ellen Page, known for her role in the movie Juno, stands alone with a sign. The sign says Burma, now called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia with a bad government. The government came to power in 1962. In 2007, people in Burma protested against their government. The protests were led by Burmese monks. They wore red clothes. The people of Burma started to take notice of the protests. At first, the government allowed the monks to meet peacefully. But then the situation became violent. The military fought the monks. The monks' houses were broken. Foreign reporters were arrested. A Japanese reporter, Kenji Nagai, was killed in 2007 for watching a protest.\n\nThis is not new. Governments want to control people. They do not like dissent. This has happened many times in history. Ancient Roman leaders thought they were chosen by gods. Japanese leaders believed they were gods. Some leaders in the United States have talked to a man named Ted Haggard. He leads a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nMany bad things have happened. One example is the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Students and workers protested against their government. The death toll was not clear. Some said 200-300 people died. Others said 2,000-3,000 people died. In Rwanda, Hutu groups killed many people, including those from another group called Tutsis. Hitler's government also killed many people during World War II. They killed anyone who was Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington is a famous musician. His long career helped make him a great composer. Many of his songs show his good skills as a composer. He often wrote music that let band members show their skills. This was good for the band and made their music sound great. Ellington wrote music that fit the style of each band member. He made music that sounded good together.\n\nEllington’s piano playing is not very noticeable in some of his music. But he was a great composer. He wrote music that sounded rich and complex. He let band members play freely in his music. He also wrote tightly planned pieces that sounded great with the band.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington’s music. It says he used voice like a musical instrument. This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to make his music sound better. One of his songs, Creole Love Call, is an early example of this. This song is a slow blues song with 12 parts. It has six parts where the voice and the band trade back and forth.\n\nIn the first part, the voice sings smoothly. Then it gets rough at the end. In the second part, a trumpet plays a solo. The trumpet makes the basic melody sound better. In the third part, a clarinet plays a solo. The piano plays a simple but nice rhythm. In the fourth part, the whole band plays the first part again. The brass and reed sections trade back and forth. In the fifth part, the reeds start to play the call and response in a high sound. The brass and rhythm sections play a funny stop-and-go rhythm. In the sixth part, the voice and reeds trade back and forth again. This time the voice sounds like a special growl.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to make his music sound better is one thing he did well. Another example is in the song Hot and Bothered. He wrote tight music and used his ear to make his music sound good. He made a call and response part between a trumpet and a singer. The singer sang in a funny way and the trumpet player played in a special way. This made their music sound rich and good. He also used a trombone player to make the music sound good in another song.\n\nEllington’s use of voice and his good ear for music made his music sound great. He was a great composer and musician.",

She wanted a person, not a thing. But she was not interested in any boys. Many boys liked her, but none of them interested her. She often asked herself, \"What is it that I want?\" She thought about this for a long time. She thought maybe it was a boy, but she didn't think so.\n\nThis girl was very lucky. Her parents were good people. They never fought with each other. They rarely argued with her. The only time they argued was when she wanted to be independent. Her parents were calm, but she was not.

            "This study wanted to see if following a special way of eating, called the Mediterranean Diet, can help prevent heart disease and strokes. The study looked at how well women followed this diet. The Mediterranean Diet is a way of eating that includes many plant foods, nuts, fruits, whole grains, and fish. It also includes some alcohol, but less animal products and fat.\n\nPast studies showed that people who followed this diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems. This new study wanted to see if it could prevent strokes and deaths from strokes.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old who did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women were part of a big study of nurses in 11 states. The women answered questions about what they ate six times between 1984 and 2004. The answers were used to create a score that showed how well they followed the Mediterranean Diet.\n\nThe study also looked at other things that might affect the results, like how much the women weighed, if they smoked, and how much they exercised. The study adjusted for these things to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet more closely were less likely to get heart disease and strokes. They were also less likely to die from these diseases. Women who followed the diet the most were 71% less likely to get heart disease and strokes compared to those who followed it the least.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a very bad financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes fell. Some very big companies failed. This situation is still bad today. We need to know how this happened and how to stop it.\n\nThe financial crisis was caused by bad decisions made by people in government. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was done in a country with weak financial systems. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big companies, were asked to make these bad loans into something called CDOs.\n\nWhen people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. They sold the bad loans to other companies and to the rest of the economy. This caused big problems.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he loosened rules about lending. This helped create the problem of bad loans seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times said at that time, “Fannie Mae is giving more loans to people who cannot pay them back.” He said this could cause big problems in the future.\n\nMany things happened together to make the economy very bad. New types of mortgages made things worse. These were mortgages that could change their interest rates, and they were very complicated. This made people and banks take too many risks.\n\nThe value of homes fell, and many people could not pay their mortgages. The big banks that had these bad loans were in big trouble. In 2007, these banks had $4.1 trillion in bad debts. This was 30% of the total value of the United States.\n\nFour big banks, Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and Goldman Sachs, lost a lot of money. They were forced to change what they did. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in bad loans and were taken over by the government.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky. It is the part where you tell your readers about events and things that happened before the main story starts. But too much exposition can be boring. It is like a long, slow walk on a quiet street. You might start to feel sleepy.\n\nThe problem with exposition is that it is easy to use too much. You might think, \"I want to tell you everything about this character.\" But the reader does not need to know everything. They just need to know what is important.\n\nImagine you are reading a story and you are told that the heroine met her husband at a party, got married in a big ceremony, and then he was murdered in front of her. That would take a lot of time. The writer would have to tell you a lot of details. But it would be better to show you this part of the story instead of just telling you. For example, you could see how the heroine and her husband talk to each other. You could see how much they love each other. This way, you would care about what happens to him when he dies.\n\nAs a writer, you have to give your readers the right amount of information. You do not want to give them too much or too little. If you give them too much, they might get bored. If you give them too little, they might not understand what is happening.\n\nIt is like cooking a meal. You have to put the right amount of salt and pepper in the food so it tastes good. If you put too much salt, it is too salty. If you put too little salt, it is not tasty.\n\nSo, remember, as a writer, you need to be careful with exposition. Give your readers just the right amount of information so they can enjoy your story.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. The man's name is Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They spent two minutes on this story. The wife was hurt badly and the man was arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe next story was about a boy named Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very badly hurt but no one was arrested yet. The police were investigating. This story was short. I think it was short because the boy is black and lives in a black neighborhood. I noticed that when a white person is hurt or missing, the news talks about it a lot. But when a minority person is hurt or missing, it is not talked about as much.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. The police think a small bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. They are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information about who did it.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. They said it would be hot and stormy on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be high.\n\nThe next story was about a robbery at a Clime Road store. The police said a tall, black man with a black hoodie robbed the store. They spent a lot of time talking about how black the man was. This seemed strange.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer from Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months. They also said he is Hispanic. I don't think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special feeling between brothers. It is strong and hard to break. This feeling has many parts: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers know each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brother. This bond is clear when things get very bad. When brothers see the good or bad things in their bond, they have to deal with the results. When one brother looks at another and sees himself, he sees who he really is. He sees his true character in his actions and what happens because of them.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this idea. They go on a journey through a beautiful place. They are very different. One brother is very sick and can't do many things. The healthy brother is very disappointed. He wanted a brother to play with and learn from. He wanted someone to be with him in exciting activities. But the sick brother can't do those things. The healthy brother feels angry and sad. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels a little better. This shows that he loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about a boy named Doodle. He is sick and can't play like other children. His brother wants to teach him things, but Doodle can't do them. The brother feels sad and angry because his brother can't be what he wants him to be.

            "The brain is a very important and complicated system. It helps us think and remember.  Long ago, people thought of the brain like a slate, a piece of paper, and a book. Later, they thought of it like a computer. But these pictures are not very good. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain works like a machine. It takes in information from our senses. Our senses feel, see, and hear things. They turn these things into signals that the brain can understand. The brain then changes these signals many times. This is called processing. There are two kinds of processing: one goes from simple to complex, and the other uses the brain's decisions to help us recognize things faster.\n\nFor example, when you see a picture of a box, the brain puts together small pieces of information like color and shape. Then it decides that you are seeing a box. The brain also uses what it already knows to help you decide that it's a box and not a hole. It's like your brain is helping your brain.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides which signals are important. It sends the important signals to the right parts of the brain. For example, you might hear many different sounds, but you only pay attention to the sound of your name. The brain has many steps of processing, and it repeats this filtering many times.\n\nThe brain needs to store information to process it. There are three kinds of memory: short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory is like a computer screen. It keeps information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Working memory is like a computer program that stores information for a short time. Long-term memory is like a computer that stores information forever.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain stores information. Some scientists study how people remember things. Others study computers. Still, others study how the brain works. One idea is that the brain has a network of ideas. Each idea is connected to other ideas like it. For example, the idea of a chair is connected to the idea of a table, which is connected to the idea of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He creates a society where people value community over individual freedom. They are taught from birth to be happy and not think too much. The citizens are like pawns in a game, controlled by the World Controller. Huxley is worried about the future and the way people are being treated.\n\nIn Brave New World, people are not thinking for themselves. They are controlled by the people in charge. This is like the idea of false consciousness in Marxism. The common people do not know about the relationship between different groups in society. They are too busy thinking about themselves. This is because the people in charge control what they think and do. The lower classes are not aware of this. They are happy to buy and consume, and do not think about the system they live in. The people in charge are also not doing anything to change things. They just accept their position.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have deep relationships. They do not have strong feelings like love or hate. They just talk about physical things, like how someone looks. This is because they are not allowed to have deep feelings. The people in the different social classes are happy with their place in society. This shows how capitalism affects people's lives. They do not think about anything else, and just follow the rules.\n\nHuxley is saying that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and individuality. People are not allowed to be different or think for themselves. They just do what they are told. This is what Huxley is trying to show in his novel.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, a place far from the center of campus. My home in Stuart Hall was very far from my classes in Willard building. It took 25 minutes to walk from my home to class, especially on bad days. I met an older student and asked about the old East Halls dorms. He told me they were once far from the rest of the school. Now, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus grows, getting around becomes harder. The best way to solve this problem is with bicycles. But it is not just about the bike. Students need to ride them, and the campus must be made for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who started riding again after a few years. He said, \"Bikes are great. It is the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and the most efficient way to travel. You can go 30 miles or more with a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. I bought a bike this year and it was a smart decision. I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding my bike takes only 5 minutes. However, Pollock Road is not a safe road to ride on. Walking is also good, but I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk to class, which would take 30-40 minutes every day. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",

Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "I want to work in social work to help people. I want to work with the Division of Family and Children Services. They help children who are hurt or mistreated. They also help families who are having problems. I want to help these children and families.\n\nI have good values that can help me in social work. I value helping others. I respect people. I am honest. I promise to do my best to help people. I will work hard to be good at my job.\n\nI always wanted to help people, but I did not know how. I studied psychology in college. I thought that would help me help people. After I graduated, I took some time off. A friend introduced me to a boy who was having trouble at home. He was being hurt by his parents. I wanted to help him. I went to the police and told them what I knew. They asked me to talk to the parents. I talked to them and asked them why they were hurting their son. They made excuses. This made me want to work in social work even more. I want to help children like that boy.\n\nAnother important value for social workers is fairness. We say that everyone is special and important. But we also want everyone to be the same. I am different and I like to be different. I do not want to be like everyone else. In school, I spoke out against unfairness. I wore clothes that were not like what everyone else wore. I expressed myself in my own way. I will continue to stand up for what is right.",
            "This paper looks at two ways people understand the problem of not sleeping well. One way is called the biological model. This model looks at how genes and the body affect sleep. It also looks at sicknesses that can cause problems with sleep. The other way is called the sociocultural model. This model looks at how the world around us and our life situations affect sleep.\n\nThe biological model focuses on genetic information that we get from our parents and medical problems that can affect sleep. Scientists have found that special cells in the brain called neurons help us sleep and wake up. These neurons have a special helper that is important for sleep. If this helper is not working right, it can be hard to sleep.\n\nOne study found that mice that were given a special medicine that helped this helper sleep more. This study shows that the body's helpers for sleep can be important for getting a good night's sleep. If these helpers are not working right, it can be hard to sleep without medicine. This study can help us understand why some people have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the world around us and our life situations affect sleep. This model looks at things like our family, friends, and where we live. It also looks at how our life situations, such as our job and money, can affect sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model is important because it shows that our surroundings and life situations can affect our sleep. For example, if we are stressed or anxious, it can be hard to sleep. If we have a hard time sleeping, it can affect our daily life and our ability to do things we need to do.\n\nThis paper will look at research that helps us understand the biological and sociocultural models of not sleeping well. We will look at the strengths and weaknesses of this research and how it can help us understand the problem of not sleeping well.\n\nInsomnia is a problem that can be caused by different things. It can be caused by medical problems, mental health problems, or other issues. There are different types of insomnia, including primary insomnia, which is a problem with sleeping, and hypersomnia, which is a problem with staying awake.\n\nResearch has shown that insomnia can be caused by genetic factors, such as problems with the body's helpers for sleep. It can also be caused by environmental factors, such as stress and anxiety. This shows that both the biological and sociocultural models are important for understanding the problem of not sleeping well.",
            "This paper will explain Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. We will look at the definition, how to identify the problem, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in the classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses sound. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brains do not work well with what they hear. The brain has trouble separating sounds and understanding speech when there is noise around. \n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Back then, it was called \"auditory imperception.\" Scientists were trying to understand children with communication problems. They started making tests to help identify these problems in 1954. In 1961, a scientist named Kimura created a model to explain how our brains work with sound.\n\nCAPD shows itself in different ways. A person with CAPD may have trouble locating where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two sounds at the same time. They may not be able to understand sound patterns or changes in speech. They may have trouble understanding sarcasm or jokes because of changes in voice. Sometimes, a loud sound can block out a softer sound. They may have trouble putting together sound clues to make sense of things. And they may have trouble understanding the order of things they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, a doctor or therapist will watch how they listen and act. They may also give them tests to see how they do with sound. These tests can include asking questions, watching how they respond to different sounds, and looking at how well they can understand speech. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nTeachers in a classroom can help students with CAPD by giving them extra help and understanding. They can also make changes in the classroom to make it easier for the student to learn.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that people use disguise to trick others. But this trickery can be difficult to end. When someone uses a disguise, they may lose their true self. A problem with stopping a trick is that the person may become lonely. They may not be able to keep their friends.\n\nThe play makes us think about why people want to change who they are. In the play, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man. She does this to keep herself safe. She is in a new place and wants to hide. Her plan works, but it also separates her from her female friends.\n\nViola is very good at acting like a man. A woman named Olivia thinks she is in love with Viola. But really, Olivia is in love with Viola's friend Sebastian. Viola also has feelings for the king, Orsino. Orsino wants Viola to love him, but Viola is pretending to be a man.\n\nSome people see Twelfth Night as a play that helps people understand their feelings. It shows how people may have hidden emotions that they do not show. For example, Olivia may be attracted to Viola because Viola is a man. But this is not clear. The play makes fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThis is shown when Olivia forgets about Viola and starts to think of Viola as a sister. This makes us wonder if Olivia really liked Viola as a man or if she was just pretending.",
            "The German colonial rule in Africa was a time of much suffering. Many people saw this suffering, especially with the deaths of the Ovaherero and Nama people. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. It was different in different places, like in geography and how the rulers made decisions. The German colonies had different education systems.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. The Germans had done a good job of helping Africans learn. But in another colony, South West Africa (now Namibia), the situation was very different. The government did not help the Africans learn as much. Instead, missionary groups helped, but they did not get much help from the government. The government, however, spent a lot of money to help the Europeans learn.\n\nThe government built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools a lot. This had a big effect on South West Africa long after the Germans were gone. Many Africans in other German colonies were educated and could read and write. But in South West Africa, the majority of the people were not educated.\n\nThere are many books about education in the German colonies. Most of these books are in German and were written a long time ago. Some of these books just described the education systems in the colonies. Later, more writers compared the education systems in the different colonies. They found many differences. One writer, Cohen, compared the education systems in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of European settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the differences.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but a lot of the land was desert. The number of European settlers in South West Africa was not as high as in other colonies. By 1913, there were about 15,000 Europeans living in South West Africa. This was more than in East Africa, where the next largest number of settlers lived.",
            "Heavy Metal Music - A Special Kind of Sound\n\nHeavy Metal music has changed a lot over the past 100 years. It is now many different kinds, and some are very hard to understand. When Heavy Metal first started, it was a new kind of music that was different from others. It was loud and had a lot of strong feelings, mostly sad or angry. Many people started to make their own kinds of Heavy Metal music. This led to many new kinds of Heavy Metal, and the types of music kept growing.\n\nToday, there are many kinds of Heavy Metal music. It has ideas from other kinds of music and has become very different. To understand Heavy Metal music, we need to know what it is and where it came from.\n\nHeavy Metal is music that is often about dark feelings. It is loud, strong, and has a lot of energy. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at their jobs. They show this in their music. Heavy Metal music also often talks about using drugs to get new ideas. Many people made Heavy Metal music in the 1970s using these drugs. They wanted to make music that was different and new. Heavy Metal music also talks about feelings that are hard to deal with, like sadness and pain. This was new in music because most music at that time was happy.\n\nSome people think that Heavy Metal music started with the Beatles. They made a song called Helter Skelter that was very loud and had strong feelings. It was like this song to show that the Beatles could make music that was as loud and strong as the Rolling Stones. The song is on the Beatles' White Album.",
            "A French artist named Henri Rousseau painted a famous picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy and amazed by the beautiful things around her. But The Dream also shows Rousseau's own dreams and wishes as an artist. Rousseau wanted many things: he wanted to be famous, to be accepted by other artists, and to get praise for his work. But he had a big problem: he wanted to be an original artist, but he also wanted to be like other famous artists. This made him very unhappy.\n\nTo understand his painting, we need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a businessman and they had a good life. Rousseau did not go to art school, but he worked for the government for many years. He was a toll collector and people called him a customs inspector. When his first wife died, he was very sad. He had eight babies, but all of them died. He had one daughter left. He wanted a new life and painting helped him to feel better. Rousseau's paintings are not like the paintings of other famous artists. They are like the paintings of ordinary people.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous, but it was hard for him. Many other artists were famous and they started painting when they were young. Rousseau started painting when he was old and he was not well-known until many years later. When someone else became famous, a man named Matisse, Rousseau was still not well-known. But Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a special way, but Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was easy to understand and that people would like. He wanted to be accepted by the art world.",
            "Many people believe that people who think about ethics and art have a close connection. They think that truth and beauty are connected. I agree with this. As the poet John Keats says, “Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty.” This is all you need to know. We learn many things in life, but we also like ethics and art without being taught. Both ethics and art try to explain things, but not to tell us what to do. We try to say why something is good or beautiful, not how to make it good or beautiful.\n\nWhen we talk about art, we use words like \"good\" and \"beautiful.\" But saying these words does not explain why something is good or beautiful. For example, people may talk about the famous painting \"Mona Lisa\" by da Vinci. They may say it is good because of its colors or its history. But saying these things does not tell us why it is good. When we talk about our favorite art or story, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This means there is something more than words can say.\n\nI believe that art and ethics are like this. They are hard to explain. As the writer Flannery O'Connor says, “You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” This means that sometimes we need to use stories to say things that cannot be said in words. I think ethics is like this too. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein says, “Ethics cannot be expressed. It is transcendental.”\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because we experience them in the same way. We experience them at a deep level, but they are hard to explain. This is true for art, but especially for literature. Literature is a special kind of art that talks about values. Values are important for living. Literature is important to us because it teaches us values.",
            "Germany is a strong country with a unique culture. This culture comes from different parts of the country. It can be seen from the mountains in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. The same culture is felt in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many groups of people lived there a long time ago. They were called Germanic tribes. The name \"German\" comes from a group called the Tungrians. Some people think the name also comes from the word \"ger,\" which means a spear. Others think it comes from the word \"garim,\" which means to shout or make a loud noise.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said they were an original people and did not come from other places. He said they lived in a wild and cold country, far from the Roman Empire. Tacitus also said the Germans traded with the Romans and sometimes fought against them.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany, but they sent their soldiers to the country to get goods. The Germanic tribes also served in the Roman army. They traded goods and skills with the Romans, but they remained on the borders of the Roman Empire.",
            "I looked down at the toilet. My mind was not working well. I was thinking, but my thoughts were not connected. I was not feeling anything. I was looking at the toilet, but I was not thinking about it. \n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw. I wanted to draw pictures since I was six years old. An artist I worked with told me to try a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The book teaches how to draw. It teaches how the brain works when we look at lines and shapes. \n\nThe book says to draw a square around the picture you want to draw. This helps you see the picture better. But when I looked at the toilet, I could not think of a square. I was too busy looking at the toilet. \n\nI thought about artists like Picasso. He liked the color blue. Monet liked green. But I was not thinking about colors. I was thinking about the toilet. \n\nMy hand was on the toilet handle. I turned the handle. But nothing happened. The toilet was not flushing. I was frustrated. I had to flush the toilet. I gripped the mop and tried again. The toilet still did not flush. I was getting angry. \n\nI was staring at the toilet. It was full of brown water. I did not want to touch it. But I had to. I had to get the mop into the toilet. I gripped the toilet paper holder with my other hand and leaned in. I was trying to be careful. I did not want to touch the yucky water. \n\nI dipped the mop into the toilet. It was not easy. I had to be careful not to get my hand wet. I was thinking about the book. I was thinking about drawing. But I was also thinking about the toilet. It was not a nice thought.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several reasons make this a big problem. The National Institutes of Health say the brain of a teenager is not ready for the dangers of driving. Driving without experience is also a problem. Many inexperienced drivers cause more accidents, and they crash more often. They also drive too fast and leave the road.\n\nTeenagers are more likely to crash when they drive with friends. A study in Southern California found that the age of the passenger is linked to the number of accidents. \n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teenagers by requiring special licenses that limit the hours they drive and do not allow other minors in the car.\n\nBut I think these special licenses are not enough. The real problem is that teenagers are not ready to handle the dangers of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He says teenagers often like to take risks for the fun of it. This is why we should not give driver's licenses to young teens. If we do, the number of accidents and deaths will keep going up. By 2010, there will be many more young drivers on the road.\n\nSimple rules could help solve this problem. Schools could teach driving classes, but no one under 18 could drive. A special permit could still be given before a full license. Students would need to practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours required could be the same as in most states. This would help keep teenagers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a good way to protect young drivers.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. They have many old films made by Thomas Edison. I wanted to watch all of the films that were tricks. There were fifteen of these films from 1895 to 1901. These films often use editing to make illusions. I studied these films to learn how they use creative editing. I also wanted to see how some of the later films were different.\n\nMost of these trick films were made on a small stage. They used a special framework called a proscenium. The camera did not move. It stayed in one place. The filmmakers used long shots and medium shots. This was common in early films. It came from the way theatre and magic shows were done. \n\nOne thing that is clear is that the actors in these films can only move side to side. They cannot walk towards or away from the camera. In the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors come in from one side and move back and forth. They go out of the frame, but the camera does not follow.\n\nThese trick films often use long shots or medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. It is like watching a play or a magic show. You see the whole performance at once.\n\nMost of these early trick films have only one shot. This limits the length of the film. It is usually short, about a minute. The films often show simple tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, sometimes one shot can be made up of many different parts. This can create an illusion of something disappearing or appearing. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). You can see when the \"head\" of Mary is shown, even though the whole film is one shot.",
            "One American man was very important to the early United States. His name was John Taylor. He was a farmer and a politician. He was dedicated to his work and spoke his mind. Taylor believed in freedom for everyone. He thought farming was the best way to live. His ideas about government were based on his love of farming.\n\nTaylor thought the United States was special because it had no old traditions to follow. This meant the country could create a fair government. He believed all people have rights that should not be taken away by the government. He said if one right is taken away, all rights are at risk.\n\nTaylor believed in a system of good and evil. He thought governments have the same good and bad qualities as people. He said a good government protects private property and helps farmers. He also believed in fairness and did not like capitalism. He thought a fair government would work well, even if the people in charge are not fair.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that follows the Constitution exactly. He did not want the government to have too much power. He thought a big government would be expensive and unfair. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution was not enough. He believed the writers of the Constitution had a plan, and we should follow it.\n\nTaylor liked the Declaration of Independence more than the Constitution. He thought it said the United States is made up of many independent states, not just one country.",
            "The number of people filling out commuter logs was very low in the third month of the project. This was a problem and hard to understand. There was a big drop in the number of people commuting by bicycle or on foot in the winter. December was a very busy time on campus. Many students and teachers were finishing their schoolwork and preparing for grades. They may not have had time to fill out the commuter log. There was also a holiday break in December. Many people did not have to come to campus. Classes did not start again until late January. But even this did not explain why so few people filled out the log in February.\n\nWe thought that a big project like this might have a lot of excitement at first, but then the interest would decrease. We wanted to keep people involved. We made a special project called Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a big effort to keep people interested. It did work and more people filled out the log that month.\n\nOne problem with this project was that people like to drive their cars. This is a part of American culture. We gave prizes to people who used alternative ways to commute. We gave gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. This was very helpful. But we thought it would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would have helped. For example, a new bicycle or a new car could have made people more interested.\n\nThe prizes we gave out did not change much during the project. We thought it would be better to increase the prizes as the project went on. This might have kept people more interested. The gift cards were good at first, but if we had announced that we would give a new bicycle or a new car later, many more people might have filled out the log.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. But an ETF is more flexible and trades like a stock. \n\nAn ETF gives you the benefits of an index fund and the benefits of owning one stock. These benefits include the ability to sell the stock quickly, buy more stock with borrowed money, and buy as little as one share. The fees of ETFs are much lower than those of most mutual funds. \n\nHowever, there are some downsides. You must pay a fee for each trade like you would for a stock. Many ETFs are available. It is smart to check if the benefits of an ETF are true and how much they are true. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if the benefits of owning one ETF are the same as owning a group of 10 stocks. We will also see if there is a better way to own these stocks. \n\nTo make this easier, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and their share of the ETF.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can look at how they would do if they made up a portfolio on their own. We will use a chart to show the results.\n\nThe chart shows that the 10 stocks make up a portfolio that is 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in returns. The chart also shows that the 10 stocks have a lower risk level, or Beta, than the ETF. \n\nThis means that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with less risk. But we must be sure that these results are true and not just a chance. \n\nTo do this, we will look at the risk level of each stock. We will compare the risk level of the 10 stocks to the risk level of the ETF. If they are different, we will say they are statistically different.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land.\" Some people think \"Dream-Land\" is one of Poe's best poems. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in two parts of the poem. He got this word from an old writer named Virgil.\n\nVirgil used the word \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the end of the world. But Poe got the word from another writer. Poe liked reading German writers.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew about the German writer Goethe. Goethe was a famous writer of poetic plays. One of his plays is called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king whose wife dies. The king is very sad and starts drinking. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. Then he goes to a cliff, throws a goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" is similar to the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" They both feel sad and alone. Maybe Poe used \"Thulé\" as a way to show his own sadness. Goethe's \"Faust\" was made into a play in 1842. This was just before Poe wrote about Thulé in another poem. Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" The poem is about a dark and lonely place. The speaker is haunted by his dead friends and sees a world without color. This is similar to the king in \"The King of Thulé,\" who has lost his wife and his will to live.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known about. Poe said he admired another writer named Tennyson. Poe would have learned about Goethe from his work or from reproductions of his writing.",
            "If a customer at a grocery store in California slips and falls on spilled applesauce, can the customer get extra money as punishment from the store? This extra money is called punitive damages. The customer, Jennifer Palmer, claims the store manager acted very badly. She says he was told about the spill twice but did nothing about it because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to throw out Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To get this kind of damages, the customer must show that the store manager acted on purpose and with a complete disregard for the harm that could happen. Jennifer Palmer can say that the store manager should have known about the danger because many other customers had slipped and fallen on the same issue in the past. The manager still did nothing. Jennifer Palmer can also say that the manager's behavior was very bad because he ignored the problem even though it had happened many times before.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee of the store told the manager about the spill. The manager said he was busy eating and did not have time to help. Fifteen minutes later, another employee told the manager about the spill, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell and got hurt. Before that, five other customers had slipped and fallen in the same store in 2009.\n\nJennifer Palmer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury and for extra money as punishment. We are thinking about asking the judge to throw out the part of the lawsuit that asks for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a person can get punitive damages if someone breaks a rule that is not part of a contract. The rule says that someone can get punitive damages if the person acted with evil or was very mean and showed a complete disregard for the safety of others. The court has said that someone acts with malice when they are aware of the danger and do nothing to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC. A big question in class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is even more important today. Looking back on events since 9/11, I have seen how the media view Islam changed. In 2001, it was mostly negative. Today, it is very accepting of Islam in America. Now we have a president named Barack Obama, whose family has Muslim background.\n\nThe story of the Prophet is interesting to me. It says Muhammad was a kind and humble man. This is different from what I thought I knew about him. I thought he made people join Islam by force. He would conquer cities and make people follow Islam. But the story says Muhammad was a hero who was misunderstood. People saw the good in him and wanted to learn from him.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the actions of Muhammad. One example is when he made food multiply to feed many people. This makes me think the writers wanted us to see Muhammad as a great teacher who didn't need to prove himself. They wanted us to see that he was a man of truth and miracles. This is dishonest because it takes away from the special story of Jesus Christ. It's like they are taking credit for Jesus' work.\n\nSome stories in the biography seem to be about proving that many people converted to Islam on their own. But these stories are not direct. They tell us what someone else heard from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true. I don't like this because it makes the story seem suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the biography makes Muhammad seem like a perfect man. It says he was kind and gentle. But history says he was not. I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus were not followed by his followers after he died.  A movement of Christian thought happened after his death.  This movement moved away from Jesus' ideas.  If we look at this history, we see that Christianity has changed a lot over time.  It has moved away from its start.  Today, people are starting to think differently.  Many people are aware of this change and want to know more.  Some people still believe in the old teachings.  They will not change their minds.  But they may not be able to stop the change.  Many Christians will learn more about the past.  This will make them want to go back to the original ideas of Jesus.  This will take a long time, maybe even centuries.  But it will happen.  There will be a time when Christians go back to the original teachings of Jesus.  A movement will grow and people will remove the extra teachings that were added over time.  This will make Christianity like it was when Jesus lived.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas.  The church will remain strong to lead the way.  But the church will not be the same.  People will think and believe the same way.  There will be less difference between different groups of Christians.  This has happened before.  A long time ago, Christians were persecuted.  Then they became the rulers.  Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly.  Now they have leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the start and forget the extra teachings.\n\nIf we look back in time, we see that there was only one kind of Jewish religion.  But over time, the Jewish people divided into groups.  These groups were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and many ordinary people.  They did not agree with each other.  They had different ideas about God.",
            "The Jungle shows how people are naturally selfish. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The main factory owners and managers are very greedy. They want to make their businesses big and strong, but they do not think about people or animals who might be hurt. They do not care about the pollution from their factories or the dirty water and air.\n\nThe factory owners do not care about their workers. They want to make more money, so they make their workers work very long hours. They can lay off many workers at any time without giving them anything. There were no laws to protect workers in those days. The factory owners could do what they wanted. They made their workers work in bad conditions. People who worked in the factories were treated very badly. They were living in very poor conditions and had no help. Unions were formed to help workers, but they often made money from the workers instead of helping them. Workers had no way to get out of this bad situation. They were like slaves. Many workers were poor and hungry, and they had to ask for help from the factory owners. This made immorality common.\n\nThis book, The Jungle, shows how people are treated unfairly. It shows how some people are very cruel and only care about themselves. The author, Upton Sinclair, wants to show us the problems that exist in the world.",
            "Some authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. They use many techniques. Some are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He uses a special way of combining words to give readers a certain feeling. Sometimes, he pairs an adjective and a noun that do not usually go together. This creates a special meaning around a subject. \n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with colors. He gives meaning to many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red. In The Great Gatsby, he creates meaning for white and gray. White is nice and high class. Gray is old and faded. Fitzgerald starts to use these meanings in the beginning of the novel. \n\nIn the beginning, everyone wears white. The rich characters, like Daisy and Jordan, wear white. Nick wears white flannel to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt. Even houses are white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting an impression of Gatsby's party. But even then, the colors are bright and not white. \n\nFitzgerald uses the colors to describe many everyday things. He makes some people and places seem unimportant by using the colors white and gray. He describes Jordan and Daisy's childhood as a \"white girlhood\". He says there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes. He describes an old man as gray. \n\nAfter creating these meanings, Fitzgerald uses the colors to show that some subjects are unimportant. He uses the colors to describe Daisy. He says she is dressed in white in a white car. Fitzgerald uses this technique again and again to show that Daisy is just a uniform addition. He says Daisy's fur collar is gray and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's meeting. \n\nFitzgerald uses colors in a special way to give readers a certain feeling about important objects and people. He creates meaning for colors and then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling.",
            "San Diego County is a great place for growing food. The weather is nice and sunny. Many crops grow well there, like tomatoes, citrus fruits, lettuce, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.\n\nThere is a big market for organic food in the San Diego area. Many people want to buy food from local farms. Some farms in the area offer tours and allow people to walk around and enjoy nature.\n\nOrganic farming helps the environment. It makes the area better for plants and animals. But it can be more difficult and costly than other ways of farming. Organic farmers need to work harder to keep pests and weeds away and make the soil healthy. They also need to spend more time and money.\n\nThe land in question is in a good place for this kind of farming. It is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County. The land is 160 acres and has chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is near a big forest and is home to many animals, some of which are in danger.\n\nPeople have lived on this land for a long time. Native Americans were there first, and then some people came to raise cattle and sell wood. The land was used for these things for many years.\n\nI found a real farm in the area that is doing this kind of farming. I used this farm as an example to see what kind of help a small farmer might need to make their farm successful and good for the environment.",
            "Culture is important in any discussion. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not the same for everyone. It can be hard to understand. Culture is not one thing. It is not the same everywhere. We should not say that all people from one place are the same. For example, we should not say that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are polite.\n\nIt is better to understand the culture that is important for the discussion. We should know how the culture feels about the issue. We should know how the culture will affect the talk. When we talk to people from another culture, we think about our own culture. We compare them to our own culture. This can be helpful.\n\nTo understand a different culture, we can learn about its history. We can learn about its ideas. We can learn about its prejudices. We should not judge another culture. We should accept it as it is. We should work with the culture, not against it. Especially, if we are in a weak position.\n\nIn a company, there is a company culture. The company culture is not the same as the national culture. A company culture can be strict or relaxed. A company may like employees to dress a certain way. A company may like employees to communicate in a certain way. A company may like employees to give to charities. Companies in the same country can be very different.\n\nValues are important because they tell us why people behave in certain ways. If people value saving face, they will not make their company or boss look bad. If people value a strong bargain, they will not give in easily. We should know these values before we talk to people from another culture.\n\nIt is also good to know the person we are talking to. This can help us talk to them more effectively. We should learn about the person's values and culture. This can help us get what we want.",
            "A famous Bible quote says, “The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This quote is in the Christian Bible and is used by a famous thinker, St. Anselm. We will look at the ideas of St. Anselm and another thinker, Thomas Aquinas. They both believe in the existence of God. We will compare their ideas.\n\nLet us start with the idea of St. Anselm. He thinks that we can find God inside our minds. We all know that God exists, he says. We can see this in our own thoughts. We do not need to look outside for proof. This idea is called faith. Faith means believing in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can find God by using reason and evidence. We do not need faith to believe in God. He gives five reasons for believing in God: change, cause, an uncertain world, levels of good things, and harmony. He says that these reasons show that God must exist.\n\nWe can compare these ideas. St. Anselm’s idea is based on faith. Thomas Aquinas’ idea is based on reason and evidence. We will look at these ideas to see which one is better.",
            "A long time ago, in a place called India, a famous man named Siddhartha was born. He was later known as the Buddha. He gave up his life of wealth and power to find a better way. After many years of study and hard work, he became a wise teacher. His ideas caused many people to start the religion of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is now more than 2,500 years old. But it has changed over time. This can be seen in a country called Sri Lanka. The people there celebrate a big festival every year. They cut down a tree to start the festival. The monks and laypeople participate, but the Buddha never taught about this festival. This is just one example of how Buddhism has changed. There are also changes in the rules and ideas of the religion.\n\nThese changes can be caused by both friends and enemies. Friends are people who are part of the Buddhist group. Enemies are people who do not like Buddhism. Sometimes friends can change Buddhism in bad ways. Sometimes enemies try to hurt Buddhism.\n\nWe need to know some words to understand this discussion. A friend can be a monk or a layperson. A friend is a person who is part of the Buddhist group. An enemy is a person who is not a Buddhist. A bad enemy is a person who wants to hurt Buddhism. A good enemy is a person who does not want to hurt Buddhism but may cause problems anyway.\n\nNow, let's learn about the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a big book of Buddhist texts. It is divided into three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for monks and laypeople. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and life.\n\nSome important ideas in Buddhism are no soul, suffering, and change. Everything in life is impermanent. If we understand these ideas, we can end the cycle of life and death. We can also end desire, hatred, and confusion. These ideas are like the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry was a big problem for both countries. The Mexican-American War was the most important event in this rivalry. The United States won the war and took Texas and the American Southwest from Mexico in 1848.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many disagreements about important things like religion, culture, and money. These disagreements helped create a strong dislike between the two countries. Many other nations with a shared border have similar problems and rivalries.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not alone in having a long rivalry with a neighbor. This is common in countries that share a border. The United States has had long-standing problems with Mexico and Cuba. These countries are close to the United States and have had rivalries with it for a long time.\n\nOne of the big issues between the United States and Mexico was about different religions. The United States did not want to be ruled by a king or have the Catholic Church in charge. This was also true in the past with the English and Spanish. \n\nThe United States and Mexico had 17 big disagreements during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these were about border problems. The United States and Mexico used military force to control their borders and stop bandits and outlaws from crossing. \n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico started to get better as Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States' goals changed from taking land to helping Mexico's economy. This change helped end the rivalry.",
            "I became very sick fifteen years ago. I had no idea I was going to get sick. I was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted security and safety. When I was a child, I did not have these things.\n\nA nurse always has a job. People will always get sick. This was what I was told when I grew up. So, I chose to be a nurse instead of being a scientist or a journalist.\n\nBut here I am. I am 46 years old and alone. I have no money. I cannot work. I am still sick.

            "Many things happen in nature because of evolution. This is the process of change in living things over many years. People are still trying to understand how and why this change happens. Even in the year nineteen seventeen, biologist D'Arcy Thompson said that scientists have not yet found an easy way to describe how living things are made. Today, scientists are using math to learn about how some animals build their shells.\n\nWe are studying how one type of animal builds its shell. This animal is called Prunum. We are using math to help us understand how the shell changes over time. We also studied the animal's shell in different ways. We took pictures of the animal's shell from the inside using X-rays. We used these pictures to make a list of things that describe the shape of the shell. We then put these things into a computer program. This program helps us understand how the shell might change over time.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that grows over time. The shell grows in a spiral way, like a big coil. This coil is made up of many turns, or whorls. The center of the shell is called the columella. The whorls grow at different rates. A line separates each whorl and is called a suture. The biggest whorl is called the body whorl. The rest of the whorls are called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the front, and from the back. The most common way to look at a shell is from the front, with the opening facing us.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we look at the top of the shell. We find the first line that separates the whorls. We draw a line across the shell at this point. We then count the whorls from this line. We can count them in parts of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a path that the animal follows as it grows. The path is made up of many points, or coordinates. We can use math to describe this path. We can also use math to change the way the shell grows. This helps us understand how the animal builds its shell.",
            "In Indonesia, many babies and young children die. Their deaths do not stop. The country is trying to meet goals set by the world to help the poor. But Indonesia is not doing well in helping mothers and children stay healthy. The country is not improving as fast as it should.\n\nIndonesia is making progress in getting health workers at births. Now 72 percent of births have a health worker. But this is not always a good thing. It includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot help if the baby is sick. This is why many mothers die from bleeding during birth.\n\nMore children are not getting medical help when they are sick with diarrhea. We do not have good information on how many mothers get good care after they have a baby. But we know that mothers in Indonesia do not get good care.\n\nNot enough mothers have a cesarean section, a type of surgery. Only 4 percent of mothers have this surgery. And it is worse in rural areas. In cities, 7 percent of mothers have a cesarean section, but in rural areas, it is only 2 percent. This is a problem because it means some mothers do not get good care. It also means that some mothers are not treated fairly. The rich have better access to good healthcare.\n\nThe problem is that not everyone has access to good healthcare. The poor have a hard time getting medical help. They often have to pay money to get help. And they have to pay a lot if they go to the hospital.\n\nThe next step is to fix the lack of healthcare. There are two ways to do this. We can make specific programs to help mothers and children. Or we can make the healthcare system better. The system is like a big machine. If we fix the machine, it will help all parts of the system. \n\nOne way to help mothers and children is to make programs that target one area. These programs can give good results fast. But there are some problems. If we spend a lot of money on one program, we might not have enough for other programs. And if we have many programs, they might not work well together.",
            "Two novels from the Victorian period are not like other novels from this time. They are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These stories have mystery and are a little strange. They help us understand the characters. We see their feelings and reasons for doing things.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to the main character. These strange things help us know what is going on inside Oliver's mind. For example, he remembers a shooting in his mind. This shooting makes Oliver very sad and scared. He feels pain and has no control over what is happening to him.\n\nOliver Twist uses dreams to show us what the main character is feeling. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers the shooting again. This time it feels like a dream. Oliver is very sad and helpless. He cannot change what happened. He is in a lot of pain and is very scared. This shows that Oliver does not have control over his life.\n\nOliver Twist also shows that Oliver is very sad and defeated. He feels like he cannot do anything. It is like someone, like Fagin, is controlling him and making him feel this way.\n\nAnother example of a strange and dreamlike scene is from Wuthering Heights. It says: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"\n\nThis passage describes a long and quiet night. It is like a dream. The writer uses this kind of scene to show how the characters are feeling. It helps us understand their emotions and thoughts.\n\nBoth Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are different from other novels from the Victorian period. They use strange and dreamlike scenes to show us the characters' feelings and thoughts. This makes the characters more interesting and helps us understand them better.",
            "I worked in a program for children after school. I helped students with their homework. My strengths were in English and reading. I worked with a teacher to help a boy named Adrian. He was having a hard time reading. I thought he had a problem. Some letters he could read, but others he could not. It was strange. Adrian spoke perfect English, but I thought he was from a different country. His mother came to the program one day. She did not speak English. We used my bad Spanish to talk. I understood that Adrian did not know the English alphabet. He could read, but he did not know how to read in English.\n\nI tell this story to talk about a problem in schools. Many students have trouble with language. I want to show that it is not always easy to see the problem. Adrian spoke good English, but he still had a problem.\n\nThis is a big problem in California and other places. What can we do? One answer is to help students with reading in English. But for students who do not speak much English, it is harder. We need a good plan.\n\nOne good part of a plan is dual language programs. This means teaching students in two languages. It is good for students who speak a different language at home. But it is also good for all students. Students in these programs do better in school.\n\nSome people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But it is not true. If we use this idea in all schools, all students will benefit. How can we do this? We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. But we can use helpers who speak two languages.\n\nWe can use special helpers in the classroom. They can be tutors or aids. They can help students who need it. This is a good way to help students who have trouble with language.\n\nWe can also use other ideas. We can have English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. These classes can help students learn English. We can also use private tutors. These people can help students one-on-one.\n\nThe key is to use all of these ideas together. We should not use just one idea. We should use many ideas to help students who have trouble with language.",
            "We learn early in life that there is something bigger than us. Some people go to church to learn about it, while others go to a special place called a temple. Some look inside themselves for answers. We often accept the religions our parents believe in. But some of us do not believe. We may change our ideas about what is important. We look for our own path in life.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. We sat on our porch together during the rain. The rain made the plants on the porch wet. My father looked out into the rain.

            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt says this in his book, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" People see the Gothic style as a mix of good and bad things. Some say it is not real, while others say it is great. The Gothic style has its roots in old stories and ideas. Horace Walpole's book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" is the first Gothic Novel. It combines old traditions and new ideas to create a new way of writing.\n\nWalpole uses old-fashioned stories and new ideas to make a new kind of story. He says it is a \"Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style uses ideas from the Middle Ages, like old buildings and old customs. Many people thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned and not smart. They thought it was not as good as new ideas and ways of writing.\n\nThe Gothic style is a mix of old and new ideas. It combines old stories and traditions with new ways of writing. This is why it lasts a long time and is new to people who read it a long time after it was written.\n\nOne idea that is important in Gothic stories is the idea of chivalry. Chivalry is a way of training a knight to be brave and honorable. The idea of chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it represents a good knight who is brave and honest. Gothic writers used chivalry to show what was missing in society. They wanted to make the past seem better than the present.\n\nThe writer of \"The Castle of Otranto\" was living in a time when there was a lot of trouble in the world. He was unhappy about the future. He wanted to show that the past was better than the present. He used the idea of chivalry to make the past seem ideal and romantic. He wanted to make people think that the past was better than the present.\n\nIn \"The Castle of Otranto,\" there is a character named Frederic. He is a prince who has suffered a lot. He has many qualities of a chivalrous knight. He is brave, kind, and honest. The writer uses Frederic to show what a good knight should be like. Frederic is an example of the Gothic trope of excess, which means being too good to be true.",
            "A supply chain is a flow of things. It includes the steps from getting raw materials to making and delivering products to customers. This idea was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He explained how to plan, make, and control the supply chain to meet customers' needs quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: making things, getting supplies, storing products, finding a place, moving things, and sharing information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nMaking things is the first step. It is the base of the supply chain. It says when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can find this out by looking at the market. The market is a good sign of what customers want.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many. Then they choose where to make the products and which factory will be best. This is based on the customer's needs and satisfaction. Next, managers plan the work and take care of the equipment.\n\nMaking things is a very important step. Every detail is very important. If details are not planned well, it can cost a company a lot of time and money. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of the business. This plan shows how employees should look, how to get products from trucks, and more. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly.\n\nThe second key part is getting supplies. This means making strategic decisions to decide what a company can do well. A company may have many groups making the same product. Each group has different equipment and workers. The manager chooses which group is best for each step of making the product. Managers may also decide to work with other companies to make things better.\n\nA manager might choose to work with another company to make things faster and cheaper. This is called velocity. It means making good products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "A sign on a street corner in Burma says Hitler is alive.\n\nActress Ellen Page, known for her role in the movie Juno, stands alone with a sign. The sign says Burma, now called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia with a bad government. The government came to power in 1962. In 2007, people in Burma protested against their government. The protests were led by Burmese monks. They wore red clothes. The people of Burma started to take notice of the protests. At first, the government allowed the monks to meet peacefully. But then the situation became violent. The military fought the monks. The monks' houses were broken. Foreign reporters were arrested. A Japanese reporter, Kenji Nagai, was killed in 2007 for watching a protest.\n\nThis is not new. Governments want to control people. They do not like dissent. This has happened many times in history. Ancient Roman leaders thought they were chosen by gods. Japanese leaders believed they were gods. Some leaders in the United States have talked to a man named Ted Haggard. He leads a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nMany bad things have happened. One example is the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Students and workers protested against their government. The death toll was not clear. Some said 200-300 people died. Others said 2,000-3,000 people died. In Rwanda, Hutu groups killed many people, including those from another group called Tutsis. Hitler's government also killed many people during World War II. They killed anyone who was Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington is a famous musician. His long career helped make him a great composer. Many of his songs show his good skills as a composer. He often wrote music that let band members show their skills. This was good for the band and made their music sound great. Ellington wrote music that fit the style of each band member. He made music that sounded good together.\n\nEllington’s piano playing is not very noticeable in some of his music. But he was a great composer. He wrote music that sounded rich and complex. He let band members play freely in his music. He also wrote tightly planned pieces that sounded great with the band.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington’s music. It says he used voice like a musical instrument. This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to make his music sound better. One of his songs, Creole Love Call, is an early example of this. This song is a slow blues song with 12 parts. It has six parts where the voice and the band trade back and forth.\n\nIn the first part, the voice sings smoothly. Then it gets rough at the end. In the second part, a trumpet plays a solo. The trumpet makes the basic melody sound better. In the third part, a clarinet plays a solo. The piano plays a simple but nice rhythm. In the fourth part, the whole band plays the first part again. The brass and reed sections trade back and forth. In the fifth part, the reeds start to play the call and response in a high sound. The brass and rhythm sections play a funny stop-and-go rhythm. In the sixth part, the voice and reeds trade back and forth again. This time the voice sounds like a special growl.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to make his music sound better is one thing he did well. Another example is in the song Hot and Bothered. He wrote tight music and used his ear to make his music sound good. He made a call and response part between a trumpet and a singer. The singer sang in a funny way and the trumpet player played in a special way. This made their music sound rich and good. He also used a trombone player to make the music sound good in another song.\n\nEllington’s use of voice and his good ear for music made his music sound great. He was a great composer and musician.",

She wanted a person, not a thing. But she was not interested in any boys. Many boys liked her, but none of them interested her. She often asked herself, \"What is it that I want?\" She thought about this for a long time. She thought maybe it was a boy, but she didn't think so.\n\nThis girl was very lucky.

            "This study wanted to see if following a special way of eating, called the Mediterranean Diet, can help prevent heart disease and strokes. The study looked at how well women followed this diet. The Mediterranean Diet is a way of eating that includes many plant foods, nuts, fruits, whole grains, and fish. It also includes some alcohol, but less animal products and fat.\n\nPast studies showed that people who followed this diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems. This new study wanted to see if it could prevent strokes and deaths from strokes.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old who did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women were part of a big study of nurses in 11 states. The women answered questions about what they ate six times between 1984 and 2004. The answers were used to create a score that showed how well they followed the Mediterranean Diet.\n\nThe study also looked at other things that might affect the results, like how much the women weighed, if they smoked, and how much they exercised. The study adjusted for these things to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet more closely were less likely to get heart disease and strokes. They were also less likely to die from these diseases. Women who followed the diet the most were 71% less likely to get heart disease and strokes compared to those who followed it the least.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a very bad financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes fell. Some very big companies failed. This situation is still bad today. We need to know how this happened and how to stop it.\n\nThe financial crisis was caused by bad decisions made by people in government. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was done in a country with weak financial systems. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big companies, were asked to make these bad loans into something called CDOs.\n\nWhen people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. They sold the bad loans to other companies and to the rest of the economy. This caused big problems.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he loosened rules about lending. This helped create the problem of bad loans seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times said at that time, “Fannie Mae is giving more loans to people who cannot pay them back.” He said this could cause big problems in the future.\n\nMany things happened together to make the economy very bad. New types of mortgages made things worse. These were mortgages that could change their interest rates, and they were very complicated. This made people and banks take too many risks.\n\nThe value of homes fell, and many people could not pay their mortgages. The big banks that had these bad loans were in big trouble. In 2007, these banks had $4.1 trillion in bad debts. This was 30% of the total value of the United States.\n\nFour big banks, Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and Goldman Sachs, lost a lot of money. They were forced to change what they did. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in bad loans and were taken over by the government.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky. It is the part where you tell your readers about events and things that happened before the main story starts. But too much exposition can be boring. It is like a long, slow walk on a quiet street. You might start to feel sleepy.\n\nThe problem with exposition is that it is easy to use too much. You might think, \"I want to tell you everything about this character.\" But the reader does not need to know everything. They just need to know what is important.\n\nImagine you are reading a story and you are told that the heroine met her husband at a party, got married in a big ceremony, and then he was murdered in front of her. That would take a lot of time. The writer would have to tell you a lot of details. But it would be better to show you this part of the story instead of just telling you. For example, you could see how the heroine and her husband talk to each other. You could see how much they love each other. This way, you would care about what happens to him when he dies.\n\nAs a writer, you have to give your readers the right amount of information. You do not want to give them too much or too little. If you give them too much, they might get bored. If you give them too little, they might not understand what is happening.\n\nIt is like cooking a meal. You have to put the right amount of salt and pepper in the food so it tastes good. If you put too much salt, it is too salty. If you put too little salt, it is not tasty.\n\nSo, remember, as a writer, you need to be careful with exposition. Give your readers just the right amount of information so they can enjoy your story.",
            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. The man's name is Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They spent two minutes on this story. The wife was hurt badly and the man was arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe next story was about a boy named Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very badly hurt but no one was arrested yet. The police were investigating. This story was short. I think it was short because the boy is black and lives in a black neighborhood. I noticed that when a white person is hurt or missing, the news talks about it a lot. But when a minority person is hurt or missing, it is not talked about as much.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. The police think a small bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. They are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information about who did it.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. They said it would be hot and stormy on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be high.\n\nThe next story was about a robbery at a Clime Road store. The police said a tall, black man with a black hoodie robbed the store. They spent a lot of time talking about how black the man was. This seemed strange.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer from Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months. They also said he is Hispanic. I don't think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special feeling between brothers. It is strong and hard to break. This feeling has many parts: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers know each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brother. This bond is clear when things get very bad. When brothers see the good or bad things in their bond, they have to deal with the results. When one brother looks at another and sees himself, he sees who he really is. He sees his true character in his actions and what happens because of them.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this idea. They go on a journey through a beautiful place. They are very different. One brother is very sick and can't do many things. The healthy brother is very disappointed. He wanted a brother to play with and learn from. He wanted someone to be with him in exciting activities. But the sick brother can't do those things. The healthy brother feels angry and sad. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels a little better. This shows that he loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about a boy named Doodle. He is sick and can't play like other children. His brother wants to teach him things, but Doodle can't do them. The brother feels sad and angry because his brother can't be what he wants him to be. But when Doodle smiles, his brother feels a little better.\n\nThe story shows how brothers feel about each other. They can love and be angry at the same time. They can see themselves in their brother and learn about themselves. The story is about the special bond between brothers.",
            "The brain is a very important and complicated system. It helps us think and remember.  Long ago, people thought of the brain like a slate, a piece of paper, and a book. Later, they thought of it like a computer. But these pictures are not very good. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain works like a machine. It takes in information from our senses. Our senses feel, see, and hear things. They turn these things into signals that the brain can understand. The brain then changes these signals many times. This is called processing. There are two kinds of processing: one goes from simple to complex, and the other uses the brain's decisions to help us recognize things faster.\n\nFor example, when you see a picture of a box, the brain puts together small pieces of information like color and shape. Then it decides that you are seeing a box. The brain also uses what it already knows to help you decide that it's a box and not a hole. It's like your brain is helping your brain.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides which signals are important. It sends the important signals to the right parts of the brain. For example, you might hear many different sounds, but you only pay attention to the sound of your name. The brain has many steps of processing, and it repeats this filtering many times.\n\nThe brain needs to store information to process it. There are three kinds of memory: short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory is like a computer screen. It keeps information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Working memory is like a computer program that stores information for a short time. Long-term memory is like a computer that stores information forever.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain stores information. Some scientists study how people remember things. Others study computers. Still, others study how the brain works. One idea is that the brain has a network of ideas. Each idea is connected to other ideas like it. For example, the idea of a chair is connected to the idea of a table, which is connected to the idea of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He creates a society where people value community over individual freedom. They are taught from birth to be happy and not think too much. The citizens are like pawns in a game, controlled by the World Controller. Huxley is worried about the future and the way people are being treated.\n\nIn Brave New World, people are not thinking for themselves. They are controlled by the people in charge. This is like the idea of false consciousness in Marxism. The common people do not know about the relationship between different groups in society. They are too busy thinking about themselves. This is because the people in charge control what they think and do. The lower classes are not aware of this. They are happy to buy and consume, and do not think about the system they live in. The people in charge are also not doing anything to change things. They just accept their position.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have deep relationships. They do not have strong feelings like love or hate. They just talk about physical things, like how someone looks. This is because they are not allowed to have deep feelings. The people in the different social classes are happy with their place in society. This shows how capitalism affects people's lives. They do not think about anything else, and just follow the rules.\n\nHuxley is saying that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and individuality. People are not allowed to be different or think for themselves. They just do what they are told. This is what Huxley is trying to show in his novel.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, a place far from the center of campus. My home in Stuart Hall was very far from my classes in Willard building. It took 25 minutes to walk from my home to class, especially on bad days. I met an older student and asked about the old East Halls dorms. He told me they were once far from the rest of the school. Now, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus grows, getting around becomes harder. The best way to solve this problem is with bicycles. But it is not just about the bike. Students need to ride them, and the campus must be made for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who started riding again after a few years. He said, \"Bikes are great. It is the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and the most efficient way to travel. You can go 30 miles or more with a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. I bought a bike this year and it was a smart decision. I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding my bike takes only 5 minutes. However, Pollock Road is not a safe road to ride on. Walking is also good, but I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk to class, which would take 30-40 minutes every day. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have that much time."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",

The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today.

Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "This paper looks at two ways people understand the problem of not sleeping well. One way is called the biological model. This model looks at how genes and the body affect sleep. It also looks at sicknesses that can cause problems with sleep. The other way is called the sociocultural model. This model looks at how the world around us and our life situations affect sleep.\n\nThe biological model focuses on genetic information that we get from our parents and medical problems that can affect sleep. Scientists have found that special cells in the brain called neurons help us sleep and wake up. These neurons have a special helper that is important for sleep. If this helper is not working right, it can be hard to sleep.\n\nOne study found that mice that were given a special medicine that helped this helper sleep more. This study shows that the body's helpers for sleep can be important for getting a good night's sleep. If these helpers are not working right, it can be hard to sleep without medicine. This study can help us understand why some people have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe sociocultural model looks at how the world around us and our life situations affect sleep. This model looks at things like our family, friends, and where we live. It also looks at how our life situations, such as our job and money, can affect sleep.\n\nThe sociocultural model is important because it shows that our surroundings and life situations can affect our sleep. For example, if we are stressed or anxious, it can be hard to sleep. If we have a hard time sleeping, it can affect our daily life and our ability to do things we need to do.\n\nThis paper will look at research that helps us understand the biological and sociocultural models of not sleeping well. We will look at the strengths and weaknesses of this research and how it can help us understand the problem of not sleeping well.\n\nInsomnia is a problem that can be caused by different things. It can be caused by medical problems, mental health problems, or other issues. There are different types of insomnia, including primary insomnia, which is a problem with sleeping, and hypersomnia, which is a problem with staying awake.\n\nResearch has shown that insomnia can be caused by genetic factors, such as problems with the body's helpers for sleep. It can also be caused by environmental factors, such as stress and anxiety. This shows that both the biological and sociocultural models are important for understanding the problem of not sleeping well.",
            "This paper will explain Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD. We will look at the definition, how to identify the problem, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in the classroom.\n\nCAPD is a problem with how the brain uses sound. It is not a hearing problem. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but their brains do not work well with what they hear. The brain has trouble separating sounds and understanding speech when there is noise around. \n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Back then, it was called \"auditory imperception.\" Scientists were trying to understand children with communication problems. They started making tests to help identify these problems in 1954. In 1961, a scientist named Kimura created a model to explain how our brains work with sound.\n\nCAPD shows itself in different ways. A person with CAPD may have trouble locating where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two sounds at the same time. They may not be able to understand sound patterns or changes in speech. They may have trouble understanding sarcasm or jokes because of changes in voice. Sometimes, a loud sound can block out a softer sound. They may have trouble putting together sound clues to make sense of things. And they may have trouble understanding the order of things they hear.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, a doctor or therapist will watch how they listen and act. They may also give them tests to see how they do with sound. These tests can include asking questions, watching how they respond to different sounds, and looking at how well they can understand speech. There is no one test that works for everyone, and we do not know what causes CAPD.\n\nTeachers in a classroom can help students with CAPD by giving them extra help and understanding. They can also make changes in the classroom to make it easier for the student to learn.",
            "The play Twelfth Night shows that people use disguise to trick others. But this trickery can be difficult to end. When someone uses a disguise, they may lose their true self. A problem with stopping a trick is that the person may become lonely. They may not be able to keep their friends.\n\nThe play makes us think about why people want to change who they are. In the play, a woman named Viola pretends to be a man. She does this to keep herself safe. She is in a new place and wants to hide. Her plan works, but it also separates her from her female friends.\n\nViola is very good at acting like a man. A woman named Olivia thinks she is in love with Viola. But really, Olivia is in love with Viola's friend Sebastian. Viola also has feelings for the king, Orsino. Orsino wants Viola to love him, but Viola is pretending to be a man.\n\nSome people see Twelfth Night as a play that helps people understand their feelings. It shows how people may have hidden emotions that they do not show. For example, Olivia may be attracted to Viola because Viola is a man. But this is not clear. The play makes fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThis is shown when Olivia forgets about Viola and starts to think of Viola as a sister. This makes us wonder if Olivia really liked Viola as a man or if she was just pretending.",
            "The German colonial rule in Africa was a time of much suffering. Many people saw this suffering, especially with the deaths of the Ovaherero and Nama people. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. It was different in different places, like in geography and how the rulers made decisions. The German colonies had different education systems.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated Africans. The Germans had done a good job of helping Africans learn. But in another colony, South West Africa (now Namibia), the situation was very different. The government did not help the Africans learn as much. Instead, missionary groups helped, but they did not get much help from the government. The government, however, spent a lot of money to help the Europeans learn.\n\nThe government built schools for Europeans and helped the missionary schools a lot. This had a big effect on South West Africa long after the Germans were gone. Many Africans in other German colonies were educated and could read and write. But in South West Africa, the majority of the people were not educated.\n\nThere are many books about education in the German colonies. Most of these books are in German and were written a long time ago. Some of these books just described the education systems in the colonies. Later, more writers compared the education systems in the different colonies. They found many differences. One writer, Cohen, compared the education systems in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of European settlers in South West Africa was the main reason for the differences.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but a lot of the land was desert. The number of European settlers in South West Africa was not as high as in other colonies. By 1913, there were about 15,000 Europeans living in South West Africa. This was more than in East Africa, where the next largest number of settlers lived.",
            "Heavy Metal Music - A Special Kind of Sound\n\nHeavy Metal music has changed a lot over the past 100 years. It is now many different kinds, and some are very hard to understand. When Heavy Metal first started, it was a new kind of music that was different from others. It was loud and had a lot of strong feelings, mostly sad or angry. Many people started to make their own kinds of Heavy Metal music. This led to many new kinds of Heavy Metal, and the types of music kept growing.\n\nToday, there are many kinds of Heavy Metal music. It has ideas from other kinds of music and has become very different. To understand Heavy Metal music, we need to know what it is and where it came from.\n\nHeavy Metal is music that is often about dark feelings. It is loud, strong, and has a lot of energy. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at their jobs. They show this in their music. Heavy Metal music also often talks about using drugs to get new ideas. Many people made Heavy Metal music in the 1970s using these drugs. They wanted to make music that was different and new. Heavy Metal music also talks about feelings that are hard to deal with, like sadness and pain. This was new in music because most music at that time was happy.\n\nSome people think that Heavy Metal music started with the Beatles. They made a song called Helter Skelter that was very loud and had strong feelings. It was like this song to show that the Beatles could make music that was as loud and strong as the Rolling Stones. The song is on the Beatles' White Album.",
            "A French artist named Henri Rousseau painted a famous picture called The Dream in 1910. This painting shows a woman who is very happy and amazed by the beautiful things around her. But The Dream also shows Rousseau's own dreams and wishes as an artist. Rousseau wanted many things: he wanted to be famous, to be accepted by other artists, and to get praise for his work. But he had a big problem: he wanted to be an original artist, but he also wanted to be like other famous artists. This made him very unhappy.\n\nTo understand his painting, we need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a small town in northwest France. His father was a businessman and they had a good life. Rousseau did not go to art school, but he worked for the government for many years. He was a toll collector and people called him a customs inspector. When his first wife died, he was very sad. He had eight babies, but all of them died. He had one daughter left. He wanted a new life and painting helped him to feel better. Rousseau's paintings are not like the paintings of other famous artists. They are like the paintings of ordinary people.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous, but it was hard for him. Many other artists were famous and they started painting when they were young. Rousseau started painting when he was old and he was not well-known until many years later. When someone else became famous, a man named Matisse, Rousseau was still not well-known. But Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a special way, but Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that was easy to understand and that people would like. He wanted to be accepted by the art world.",
            "Many people believe that people who think about ethics and art have a close connection. They think that truth and beauty are connected. I agree with this. As the poet John Keats says, “Beauty is truth, and truth is beauty.” This is all you need to know. We learn many things in life, but we also like ethics and art without being taught. Both ethics and art try to explain things, but not to tell us what to do. We try to say why something is good or beautiful, not how to make it good or beautiful.\n\nWhen we talk about art, we use words like \"good\" and \"beautiful.\" But saying these words does not explain why something is good or beautiful. For example, people may talk about the famous painting \"Mona Lisa\" by da Vinci. They may say it is good because of its colors or its history. But saying these things does not tell us why it is good. When we talk about our favorite art or story, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This means there is something more than words can say.\n\nI believe that art and ethics are like this. They are hard to explain. As the writer Flannery O'Connor says, “You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” This means that sometimes we need to use stories to say things that cannot be said in words. I think ethics is like this too. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein says, “Ethics cannot be expressed. It is transcendental.”\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because we experience them in the same way. We experience them at a deep level, but they are hard to explain. This is true for art, but especially for literature. Literature is a special kind of art that talks about values. Values are important for living. Literature is important to us because it teaches us values.",
            "Germany is a strong country with a unique culture. This culture comes from different parts of the country. It can be seen from the mountains in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. The same culture is felt in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nGermany has a long history. Many groups of people lived there a long time ago. They were called Germanic tribes. The name \"German\" comes from a group called the Tungrians. Some people think the name also comes from the word \"ger,\" which means a spear. Others think it comes from the word \"garim,\" which means to shout or make a loud noise.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said they were an original people and did not come from other places. He said they lived in a wild and cold country, far from the Roman Empire. Tacitus also said the Germans traded with the Romans and sometimes fought against them.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germany, but they sent their soldiers to the country to get goods. The Germanic tribes also served in the Roman army. They traded goods and skills with the Romans, but they remained on the borders of the Roman Empire.",
            "I looked down at the toilet. My mind was not working well. I was thinking, but my thoughts were not connected. I was not feeling anything. I was looking at the toilet, but I was not thinking about it. \n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw. I wanted to draw pictures since I was six years old. An artist I worked with told me to try a book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The book teaches how to draw. It teaches how the brain works when we look at lines and shapes. \n\nThe book says to draw a square around the picture you want to draw. This helps you see the picture better. But when I looked at the toilet, I could not think of a square. I was too busy looking at the toilet. \n\nI thought about artists like Picasso. He liked the color blue. Monet liked green. But I was not thinking about colors. I was thinking about the toilet. \n\nMy hand was on the toilet handle. I turned the handle. But nothing happened. The toilet was not flushing. I was frustrated. I had to flush the toilet. I gripped the mop and tried again. The toilet still did not flush. I was getting angry. \n\nI was staring at the toilet. It was full of brown water. I did not want to touch it. But I had to. I had to get the mop into the toilet. I gripped the toilet paper holder with my other hand and leaned in. I was trying to be careful. I did not want to touch the yucky water. \n\nI dipped the mop into the toilet. It was not easy. I had to be careful not to get my hand wet. I was thinking about the book. I was thinking about drawing. But I was also thinking about the toilet. It was not a nice thought.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several reasons make this a big problem. The National Institutes of Health say the brain of a teenager is not ready for the dangers of driving. Driving without experience is also a problem. Many inexperienced drivers cause more accidents, and they crash more often. They also drive too fast and leave the road.\n\nTeenagers are more likely to crash when they drive with friends. A study in Southern California found that the age of the passenger is linked to the number of accidents. \n\nSome states try to make driving safer for teenagers by requiring special licenses that limit the hours they drive and do not allow other minors in the car.\n\nBut I think these special licenses are not enough. The real problem is that teenagers are not ready to handle the dangers of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He says teenagers often like to take risks for the fun of it. This is why we should not give driver's licenses to young teens. If we do, the number of accidents and deaths will keep going up. By 2010, there will be many more young drivers on the road.\n\nSimple rules could help solve this problem. Schools could teach driving classes, but no one under 18 could drive. A special permit could still be given before a full license. Students would need to practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours required could be the same as in most states. This would help keep teenagers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new. It is a good way to protect young drivers.",
            "I looked at films from the Library of Congress. They have many old films made by Thomas Edison. I wanted to watch all of the films that were tricks. There were fifteen of these films from 1895 to 1901. These films often use editing to make illusions. I studied these films to learn how they use creative editing. I also wanted to see how some of the later films were different.\n\nMost of these trick films were made on a small stage. They used a special framework called a proscenium. The camera did not move. It stayed in one place. The filmmakers used long shots and medium shots. This was common in early films. It came from the way theatre and magic shows were done. \n\nOne thing that is clear is that the actors in these films can only move side to side. They cannot walk towards or away from the camera. In the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors come in from one side and move back and forth. They go out of the frame, but the camera does not follow.\n\nThese trick films often use long shots or medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because the actors do not move towards the camera. It is like watching a play or a magic show. You see the whole performance at once.\n\nMost of these early trick films have only one shot. This limits the length of the film. It is usually short, about a minute. The films often show simple tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, sometimes one shot can be made up of many different parts. This can create an illusion of something disappearing or appearing. Look closely at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). You can see when the \"head\" of Mary is shown, even though the whole film is one shot.",
            "One American man was very important to the early United States. His name was John Taylor. He was a farmer and a politician. He was dedicated to his work and spoke his mind. Taylor believed in freedom for everyone. He thought farming was the best way to live. His ideas about government were based on his love of farming.\n\nTaylor thought the United States was special because it had no old traditions to follow. This meant the country could create a fair government. He believed all people have rights that should not be taken away by the government. He said if one right is taken away, all rights are at risk.\n\nTaylor believed in a system of good and evil. He thought governments have the same good and bad qualities as people. He said a good government protects private property and helps farmers. He also believed in fairness and did not like capitalism. He thought a fair government would work well, even if the people in charge are not fair.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that follows the Constitution exactly. He did not want the government to have too much power. He thought a big government would be expensive and unfair. But he also thought a simple reading of the Constitution was not enough. He believed the writers of the Constitution had a plan, and we should follow it.\n\nTaylor liked the Declaration of Independence more than the Constitution. He thought it said the United States is made up of many independent states, not just one country.",
            "The number of people filling out commuter logs was very low in the third month of the project. This was a problem and hard to understand. There was a big drop in the number of people commuting by bicycle or on foot in the winter. December was a very busy time on campus. Many students and teachers were finishing their schoolwork and preparing for grades. They may not have had time to fill out the commuter log. There was also a holiday break in December. Many people did not have to come to campus. Classes did not start again until late January. But even this did not explain why so few people filled out the log in February.\n\nWe thought that a big project like this might have a lot of excitement at first, but then the interest would decrease. We wanted to keep people involved. We made a special project called Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a big effort to keep people interested. It did work and more people filled out the log that month.\n\nOne problem with this project was that people like to drive their cars. This is a part of American culture. We gave prizes to people who used alternative ways to commute. We gave gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. This was very helpful. But we thought it would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would have helped. For example, a new bicycle or a new car could have made people more interested.\n\nThe prizes we gave out did not change much during the project. We thought it would be better to increase the prizes as the project went on. This might have kept people more interested. The gift cards were good at first, but if we had announced that we would give a new bicycle or a new car later, many more people might have filled out the log.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment. It follows an index, a commodity, or a group of assets like an index fund. But an ETF is more flexible and trades like a stock. \n\nAn ETF gives you the benefits of an index fund and the benefits of owning one stock. These benefits include the ability to sell the stock quickly, buy more stock with borrowed money, and buy as little as one share. The fees of ETFs are much lower than those of most mutual funds. \n\nHowever, there are some downsides. You must pay a fee for each trade like you would for a stock. Many ETFs are available. It is smart to check if the benefits of an ETF are true and how much they are true. \n\nIn this article, we will look at the ETF IHF. We will compare it to its top 10 holdings to see if the benefits of owning one ETF are the same as owning a group of 10 stocks. We will also see if there is a better way to own these stocks. \n\nTo make this easier, we will only look at the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of the ETF. Below are the top 10 stocks and their share of the ETF.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF, we can look at how they would do if they made up a portfolio on their own. We will use a chart to show the results.\n\nThe chart shows that the 10 stocks make up a portfolio that is 6.11% higher than the ETF. This is a 16% increase in returns. The chart also shows that the 10 stocks have a lower risk level, or Beta, than the ETF. \n\nThis means that a portfolio of just the top 10 stocks could give a higher return with less risk. But we must be sure that these results are true and not just a chance. \n\nTo do this, we will look at the risk level of each stock. We will compare the risk level of the 10 stocks to the risk level of the ETF. If they are different, we will say they are statistically different.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land.\" Some people think \"Dream-Land\" is one of Poe's best poems. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in two parts of the poem. He got this word from an old writer named Virgil.\n\nVirgil used the word \"Thulé\" to describe an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the end of the world. But Poe got the word from another writer. Poe liked reading German writers.\n\nThis is important because it shows Poe knew about the German writer Goethe. Goethe was a famous writer of poetic plays. One of his plays is called \"Faust.\" It was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem is about a king whose wife dies. The king is very sad and starts drinking. He decides to die and gives his things to his children. Then he goes to a cliff, throws a goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" is similar to the speaker in \"Dream-Land.\" They both feel sad and alone. Maybe Poe used \"Thulé\" as a way to show his own sadness. Goethe's \"Faust\" was made into a play in 1842. This was just before Poe wrote about Thulé in another poem. Poe used \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land.\" The poem is about a dark and lonely place. The speaker is haunted by his dead friends and sees a world without color. This is similar to the king in \"The King of Thulé,\" who has lost his wife and his will to live.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known about. Poe said he admired another writer named Tennyson. Poe would have learned about Goethe from his work or from reproductions of his writing.",
            "If a customer at a grocery store in California slips and falls on spilled applesauce, can the customer get extra money as punishment from the store? This extra money is called punitive damages. The customer, Jennifer Palmer, claims the store manager acted very badly. She says he was told about the spill twice but did nothing about it because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to throw out Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To get this kind of damages, the customer must show that the store manager acted on purpose and with a complete disregard for the harm that could happen. Jennifer Palmer can say that the store manager should have known about the danger because many other customers had slipped and fallen on the same issue in the past. The manager still did nothing. Jennifer Palmer can also say that the manager's behavior was very bad because he ignored the problem even though it had happened many times before.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee of the store told the manager about the spill. The manager said he was busy eating and did not have time to help. Fifteen minutes later, another employee told the manager about the spill, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell and got hurt. Before that, five other customers had slipped and fallen in the same store in 2009.\n\nJennifer Palmer is suing the store for money to pay for her injury and for extra money as punishment. We are thinking about asking the judge to throw out the part of the lawsuit that asks for punitive damages.\n\nIn California, a person can get punitive damages if someone breaks a rule that is not part of a contract. The rule says that someone can get punitive damages if the person acted with evil or was very mean and showed a complete disregard for the safety of others. The court has said that someone acts with malice when they are aware of the danger and do nothing to stop it.",
            "Four years ago, I studied Islam at CBC. A big question in class was whether Islam is a hostile religion. I think this question is even more important today. Looking back on events since 9/11, I have seen how the media view Islam changed. In 2001, it was mostly negative. Today, it is very accepting of Islam in America. Now we have a president named Barack Obama, whose family has Muslim background.\n\nThe story of the Prophet is interesting to me. It says Muhammad was a kind and humble man. This is different from what I thought I knew about him. I thought he made people join Islam by force. He would conquer cities and make people follow Islam. But the story says Muhammad was a hero who was misunderstood. People saw the good in him and wanted to learn from him.\n\nThere are some similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the actions of Muhammad. One example is when he made food multiply to feed many people. This makes me think the writers wanted us to see Muhammad as a great teacher who didn't need to prove himself. They wanted us to see that he was a man of truth and miracles. This is dishonest because it takes away from the special story of Jesus Christ. It's like they are taking credit for Jesus' work.\n\nSome stories in the biography seem to be about proving that many people converted to Islam on their own. But these stories are not direct. They tell us what someone else heard from someone else. This makes the stories seem less true. I don't like this because it makes the story seem suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the biography makes Muhammad seem like a perfect man. It says he was kind and gentle. But history says he was not. I wonder if Muslims know the true story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus were not followed by his followers after he died.  A movement of Christian thought happened after his death.  This movement moved away from Jesus' ideas.  If we look at this history, we see that Christianity has changed a lot over time.  It has moved away from its start.  Today, people are starting to think differently.  Many people are aware of this change and want to know more.  Some people still believe in the old teachings.  They will not change their minds.  But they may not be able to stop the change.  Many Christians will learn more about the past.  This will make them want to go back to the original ideas of Jesus.  This will take a long time, maybe even centuries.  But it will happen.  There will be a time when Christians go back to the original teachings of Jesus.  A movement will grow and people will remove the extra teachings that were added over time.  This will make Christianity like it was when Jesus lived.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' ideas.  The church will remain strong to lead the way.  But the church will not be the same.  People will think and believe the same way.  There will be less difference between different groups of Christians.  This has happened before.  A long time ago, Christians were persecuted.  Then they became the rulers.  Our country used to treat African-Americans unfairly.  Now they have leaders.  The same thing will happen with Christianity.  People will go back to the start and forget the extra teachings.\n\nIf we look back in time, we see that there was only one kind of Jewish religion.  But over time, the Jewish people divided into groups.  These groups were Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and many ordinary people.  They did not agree with each other.  They had different ideas about God.",
            "The Jungle shows how people are naturally selfish. They want to make their lives better, but they do not care about others. The main factory owners and managers are very greedy. They want to make their businesses big and strong, but they do not think about people or animals who might be hurt. They do not care about the pollution from their factories or the dirty water and air.\n\nThe factory owners do not care about their workers. They want to make more money, so they make their workers work very long hours. They can lay off many workers at any time without giving them anything. There were no laws to protect workers in those days. The factory owners could do what they wanted. They made their workers work in bad conditions. People who worked in the factories were treated very badly. They were living in very poor conditions and had no help. Unions were formed to help workers, but they often made money from the workers instead of helping them. Workers had no way to get out of this bad situation. They were like slaves. Many workers were poor and hungry, and they had to ask for help from the factory owners. This made immorality common.\n\nThis book, The Jungle, shows how people are treated unfairly. It shows how some people are very cruel and only care about themselves. The author, Upton Sinclair, wants to show us the problems that exist in the world.",
            "Some authors use different ways to make readers feel a certain way about important subjects. They use many techniques. Some are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. He uses a special way of combining words to give readers a certain feeling. Sometimes, he pairs an adjective and a noun that do not usually go together. This creates a special meaning around a subject. \n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with colors. He gives meaning to many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red. In The Great Gatsby, he creates meaning for white and gray. White is nice and high class. Gray is old and faded. Fitzgerald starts to use these meanings in the beginning of the novel. \n\nIn the beginning, everyone wears white. The rich characters, like Daisy and Jordan, wear white. Nick wears white flannel to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt. Even houses are white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting an impression of Gatsby's party. But even then, the colors are bright and not white. \n\nFitzgerald uses the colors to describe many everyday things. He makes some people and places seem unimportant by using the colors white and gray. He describes Jordan and Daisy's childhood as a \"white girlhood\". He says there are gray cars and gray land in the valley of ashes. He describes an old man as gray. \n\nAfter creating these meanings, Fitzgerald uses the colors to show that some subjects are unimportant. He uses the colors to describe Daisy. He says she is dressed in white in a white car. Fitzgerald uses this technique again and again to show that Daisy is just a uniform addition. He says Daisy's fur collar is gray and she wears a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's meeting. \n\nFitzgerald uses colors in a special way to give readers a certain feeling about important objects and people. He creates meaning for colors and then uses that meaning to remind readers of a feeling.",

Many people want to buy food from local farms. Some farms in the area offer tours and allow people to walk around and enjoy nature.\n\nOrganic farming helps the environment. It makes the area better for plants and animals. But it can be more difficult and costly than other ways of farming. Organic farmers need to work harder to keep pests and weeds away and make the soil healthy. They also need to spend more time and money.\n\nThe land in question is in a good place for this kind of farming. It is near a town called Potrero in San Diego County. The land is 160 acres and has chaparral, grass, and oak trees. It is near a big forest and is home to many animals, some of which are in danger.\n\nPeople have lived on this land for a long time. Native Americans were there first, and then some people came to raise cattle and sell wood. The land was used for these things for many years.\n\nI found a real farm in the area that is doing this kind of farming. I used this farm as an example to see what kind of help a small farmer might need to make their farm successful and good for the environment.",
            "Culture is important in any discussion. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not the same for everyone. It can be hard to understand. Culture is not one thing. It is not the same everywhere. We should not say that all people from one place are the same. For example, we should not say that all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are polite.\n\nIt is better to understand the culture that is important for the discussion. We should know how the culture feels about the issue. We should know how the culture will affect the talk. When we talk to people from another culture, we think about our own culture. We compare them to our own culture. This can be helpful.\n\nTo understand a different culture, we can learn about its history. We can learn about its ideas. We can learn about its prejudices. We should not judge another culture. We should accept it as it is. We should work with the culture, not against it. Especially, if we are in a weak position.\n\nIn a company, there is a company culture. The company culture is not the same as the national culture. A company culture can be strict or relaxed. A company may like employees to dress a certain way. A company may like employees to communicate in a certain way. A company may like employees to give to charities. Companies in the same country can be very different.\n\nValues are important because they tell us why people behave in certain ways. If people value saving face, they will not make their company or boss look bad. If people value a strong bargain, they will not give in easily. We should know these values before we talk to people from another culture.\n\nIt is also good to know the person we are talking to. This can help us talk to them more effectively. We should learn about the person's values and culture. This can help us get what we want.",
            "A famous Bible quote says, “The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” This quote is in the Christian Bible and is used by a famous thinker, St. Anselm. We will look at the ideas of St. Anselm and another thinker, Thomas Aquinas. They both believe in the existence of God. We will compare their ideas.\n\nLet us start with the idea of St. Anselm. He thinks that we can find God inside our minds. We all know that God exists, he says. We can see this in our own thoughts. We do not need to look outside for proof. This idea is called faith. Faith means believing in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He thinks we can find God by using reason and evidence. We do not need faith to believe in God. He gives five reasons for believing in God: change, cause, an uncertain world, levels of good things, and harmony. He says that these reasons show that God must exist.\n\nWe can compare these ideas. St. Anselm’s idea is based on faith. Thomas Aquinas’ idea is based on reason and evidence. We will look at these ideas to see which one is better.",
            "A long time ago, in a place called India, a famous man named Siddhartha was born. He was later known as the Buddha. He gave up his life of wealth and power to find a better way. After many years of study and hard work, he became a wise teacher. His ideas caused many people to start the religion of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is now more than 2,500 years old. But it has changed over time. This can be seen in a country called Sri Lanka. The people there celebrate a big festival every year. They cut down a tree to start the festival. The monks and laypeople participate, but the Buddha never taught about this festival. This is just one example of how Buddhism has changed. There are also changes in the rules and ideas of the religion.\n\nThese changes can be caused by both friends and enemies. Friends are people who are part of the Buddhist group. Enemies are people who do not like Buddhism. Sometimes friends can change Buddhism in bad ways. Sometimes enemies try to hurt Buddhism.\n\nWe need to know some words to understand this discussion. A friend can be a monk or a layperson. A friend is a person who is part of the Buddhist group. An enemy is a person who is not a Buddhist. A bad enemy is a person who wants to hurt Buddhism. A good enemy is a person who does not want to hurt Buddhism but may cause problems anyway.\n\nNow, let's learn about the basic ideas of Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three important things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a big book of Buddhist texts. It is divided into three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has all the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for monks and laypeople. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and life.\n\nSome important ideas in Buddhism are no soul, suffering, and change. Everything in life is impermanent. If we understand these ideas, we can end the cycle of life and death. We can also end desire, hatred, and confusion. These ideas are like the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry was a big problem for both countries. The Mexican-American War was the most important event in this rivalry. The United States won the war and took Texas and the American Southwest from Mexico in 1848.\n\nThe United States and Mexico had many disagreements about important things like religion, culture, and money. These disagreements helped create a strong dislike between the two countries. Many other nations with a shared border have similar problems and rivalries.\n\nThe United States and Mexico are not alone in having a long rivalry with a neighbor. This is common in countries that share a border. The United States has had long-standing problems with Mexico and Cuba. These countries are close to the United States and have had rivalries with it for a long time.\n\nOne of the big issues between the United States and Mexico was about different religions. The United States did not want to be ruled by a king or have the Catholic Church in charge. This was also true in the past with the English and Spanish. \n\nThe United States and Mexico had 17 big disagreements during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these were about border problems. The United States and Mexico used military force to control their borders and stop bandits and outlaws from crossing. \n\nThe rivalry between the United States and Mexico started to get better as Mexico became more dependent on the United States. The United States' goals changed from taking land to helping Mexico's economy. This change helped end the rivalry.",
            "I became very sick fifteen years ago. I had no idea I was going to get sick. I was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted security and safety. When I was a child, I did not have these things.\n\nA nurse always has a job. People will always get sick. This was what I was told when I grew up. So, I chose to be a nurse instead of being a scientist or a journalist.\n\nBut here I am. I am 46 years old and alone. I have no money. I cannot work. I am still sick. I have been on disability for fifteen years. I have no money left.\n\nEvery day is hard for me. I need help from my family and friends. I am lucky to have them. When bad things happen, you feel weak. You do not feel strong.\n\nMy point is that bad things can happen to anyone. We cannot always prepare for them. We need to help each other. We need to trust each other.\n\nSome people in the United States think we should not depend on the government. But I think we should help each other more. We should help those who need it.\n\nOur ancestors came to America because they had help from their neighbors. They did not come alone. They worked together. We should do the same.\n\nYes, we should be prepared. I have a disaster kit. I have things to help me if I am hurt. I have food and water. But we should also help each other.

            "Many things happen in nature because of evolution. This is the process of change in living things over many years. People are still trying to understand how and why this change happens. Even in the year nineteen seventeen, biologist D'Arcy Thompson said that scientists have not yet found an easy way to describe how living things are made. Today, scientists are using math to learn about how some animals build their shells.\n\nWe are studying how one type of animal builds its shell. This animal is called Prunum. We are using math to help us understand how the shell changes over time. We also studied the animal's shell in different ways. We took pictures of the animal's shell from the inside using X-rays. We used these pictures to make a list of things that describe the shape of the shell. We then put these things into a computer program. This program helps us understand how the shell might change over time.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that grows over time. The shell grows in a spiral way, like a big coil. This coil is made up of many turns, or whorls. The center of the shell is called the columella. The whorls grow at different rates. A line separates each whorl and is called a suture. The biggest whorl is called the body whorl. The rest of the whorls are called the spire. The tip of the spire is called the apex, and the other end is called the base.\n\nWe can look at a shell from different angles. There are four main ways to look at a shell: from the top, from the bottom, from the front, and from the back. The most common way to look at a shell is from the front, with the opening facing us.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we look at the top of the shell. We find the first line that separates the whorls. We draw a line across the shell at this point. We then count the whorls from this line. We can count them in parts of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a path that the animal follows as it grows. The path is made up of many points, or coordinates. We can use math to describe this path. We can also use math to change the way the shell grows. This helps us understand how the animal builds its shell.",
            "In Indonesia, many babies and young children die. Their deaths do not stop. The country is trying to meet goals set by the world to help the poor. But Indonesia is not doing well in helping mothers and children stay healthy. The country is not improving as fast as it should.\n\nIndonesia is making progress in getting health workers at births. Now 72 percent of births have a health worker. But this is not always a good thing. It includes traditional workers, like midwives, who cannot help if the baby is sick. This is why many mothers die from bleeding during birth.\n\nMore children are not getting medical help when they are sick with diarrhea. We do not have good information on how many mothers get good care after they have a baby. But we know that mothers in Indonesia do not get good care.\n\nNot enough mothers have a cesarean section, a type of surgery. Only 4 percent of mothers have this surgery. And it is worse in rural areas. In cities, 7 percent of mothers have a cesarean section, but in rural areas, it is only 2 percent. This is a problem because it means some mothers do not get good care. It also means that some mothers are not treated fairly. The rich have better access to good healthcare.\n\nThe problem is that not everyone has access to good healthcare. The poor have a hard time getting medical help. They often have to pay money to get help. And they have to pay a lot if they go to the hospital.\n\nThe next step is to fix the lack of healthcare. There are two ways to do this. We can make specific programs to help mothers and children. Or we can make the healthcare system better. The system is like a big machine. If we fix the machine, it will help all parts of the system. \n\nOne way to help mothers and children is to make programs that target one area. These programs can give good results fast. But there are some problems. If we spend a lot of money on one program, we might not have enough for other programs. And if we have many programs, they might not work well together.",
            "Two novels from the Victorian period are not like other novels from this time. They are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These stories have mystery and are a little strange. They help us understand the characters. We see their feelings and reasons for doing things.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, strange things happen to the main character. These strange things help us know what is going on inside Oliver's mind. For example, he remembers a shooting in his mind. This shooting makes Oliver very sad and scared. He feels pain and has no control over what is happening to him.\n\nOliver Twist uses dreams to show us what the main character is feeling. In chapter 28, Oliver remembers the shooting again. This time it feels like a dream. Oliver is very sad and helpless. He cannot change what happened. He is in a lot of pain and is very scared. This shows that Oliver does not have control over his life.\n\nOliver Twist also shows that Oliver is very sad and defeated. He feels like he cannot do anything. It is like someone, like Fagin, is controlling him and making him feel this way.\n\nAnother example of a strange and dreamlike scene is from Wuthering Heights. It says: \"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"\n\nThis passage describes a long and quiet night. It is like a dream. The writer uses this kind of scene to show how the characters are feeling. It helps us understand their emotions and thoughts.\n\nBoth Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are different from other novels from the Victorian period. They use strange and dreamlike scenes to show us the characters' feelings and thoughts. This makes the characters more interesting and helps us understand them better.",
            "I worked in a program for children after school. I helped students with their homework. My strengths were in English and reading. I worked with a teacher to help a boy named Adrian. He was having a hard time reading. I thought he had a problem. Some letters he could read, but others he could not. It was strange. Adrian spoke perfect English, but I thought he was from a different country. His mother came to the program one day. She did not speak English. We used my bad Spanish to talk. I understood that Adrian did not know the English alphabet. He could read, but he did not know how to read in English.\n\nI tell this story to talk about a problem in schools. Many students have trouble with language. I want to show that it is not always easy to see the problem. Adrian spoke good English, but he still had a problem.\n\nThis is a big problem in California and other places. What can we do? One answer is to help students with reading in English. But for students who do not speak much English, it is harder. We need a good plan.\n\nOne good part of a plan is dual language programs. This means teaching students in two languages. It is good for students who speak a different language at home. But it is also good for all students. Students in these programs do better in school.\n\nSome people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money. But it is not true. If we use this idea in all schools, all students will benefit. How can we do this? We do not need all teachers to speak two languages. But we can use helpers who speak two languages.\n\nWe can use special helpers in the classroom. They can be tutors or aids. They can help students who need it. This is a good way to help students who have trouble with language.\n\nWe can also use other ideas. We can have English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. These classes can help students learn English. We can also use private tutors. These people can help students one-on-one.\n\nThe key is to use all of these ideas together. We should not use just one idea. We should use many ideas to help students who have trouble with language.",
            "We learn early in life that there is something bigger than us. Some people go to church to learn about it, while others go to a special place called a temple. Some look inside themselves for answers. We often accept the religions our parents believe in. But some of us do not believe. We may change our ideas about what is important. We look for our own path in life.\n\nMy father liked cardinals. We sat on our porch together during the rain. The rain made the plants on the porch wet. My father looked out into the rain. He was thin and his hair was thinning. I felt sad and did not know what to say. I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out at the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December. I was twenty-two years old. He was sick for a long time. The doctors kept him alive, but it was hard for him. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember him when he was alive, not when he was sick. I thought my dad would not want me to watch him die. I stayed in my bed for three days. I was very sad.\n\nI thought about God.

            "The Gothic Novel is a mix of old and new ideas. Ian Watt says this in his book, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" People see the Gothic style as a mix of good and bad things. Some say it is not real, while others say it is great. The Gothic style has its roots in old stories and ideas. Horace Walpole's book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" is the first Gothic Novel. It combines old traditions and new ideas to create a new way of writing.\n\nWalpole uses old-fashioned stories and new ideas to make a new kind of story. He says it is a \"Gothic Story.\" The Gothic style uses ideas from the Middle Ages, like old buildings and old customs. Many people thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned and not smart. They thought it was not as good as new ideas and ways of writing.\n\nThe Gothic style is a mix of old and new ideas. It combines old stories and traditions with new ways of writing. This is why it lasts a long time and is new to people who read it a long time after it was written.\n\nOne idea that is important in Gothic stories is the idea of chivalry. Chivalry is a way of training a knight to be brave and honorable. The idea of chivalry is important to Gothic writers because it represents a good knight who is brave and honest. Gothic writers used chivalry to show what was missing in society. They wanted to make the past seem better than the present.\n\nThe writer of \"The Castle of Otranto\" was living in a time when there was a lot of trouble in the world. He was unhappy about the future. He wanted to show that the past was better than the present. He used the idea of chivalry to make the past seem ideal and romantic. He wanted to make people think that the past was better than the present.\n\nIn \"The Castle of Otranto,\" there is a character named Frederic. He is a prince who has suffered a lot. He has many qualities of a chivalrous knight. He is brave, kind, and honest. The writer uses Frederic to show what a good knight should be like. Frederic is an example of the Gothic trope of excess, which means being too good to be true.",
            "A supply chain is a flow of things. It includes the steps from getting raw materials to making and delivering products to customers. This idea was first used in 1982 by a business expert named Keith Oliver. He explained how to plan, make, and control the supply chain to meet customers' needs quickly and well.\n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: making things, getting supplies, storing products, finding a place, moving things, and sharing information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to customers.\n\nMaking things is the first step. It is the base of the supply chain. It says when, why, where, and how things will be made. Managers need to know what customers want. They can find this out by looking at the market. The market is a good sign of what customers want.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what products to make and how many. Then they choose where to make the products and which factory will be best. This is based on the customer's needs and satisfaction. Next, managers plan the work and take care of the equipment.\n\nMaking things is a very important step. Every detail is very important. If details are not planned well, it can cost a company a lot of time and money. For example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of the business. This plan shows how employees should look, how to get products from trucks, and more. Having a plan helps the company work smoothly.\n\nThe second key part is getting supplies. This means making strategic decisions to decide what a company can do well. A company may have many groups making the same product. Each group has different equipment and workers. The manager chooses which group is best for each step of making the product. Managers may also decide to work with other companies to make things better.\n\nA manager might choose to work with another company to make things faster and cheaper. This is called velocity. It means making good products quickly and at a low cost.",
            "A sign on a street corner in Burma says Hitler is alive.\n\nActress Ellen Page, known for her role in the movie Juno, stands alone with a sign. The sign says Burma, now called Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia with a bad government. The government came to power in 1962. In 2007, people in Burma protested against their government. The protests were led by Burmese monks. They wore red clothes. The people of Burma started to take notice of the protests. At first, the government allowed the monks to meet peacefully. But then the situation became violent. The military fought the monks. The monks' houses were broken. Foreign reporters were arrested. A Japanese reporter, Kenji Nagai, was killed in 2007 for watching a protest.\n\nThis is not new. Governments want to control people. They do not like dissent. This has happened many times in history. Ancient Roman leaders thought they were chosen by gods. Japanese leaders believed they were gods. Some leaders in the United States have talked to a man named Ted Haggard. He leads a group called Stupid People Worldwide.\n\nMany bad things have happened. One example is the protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Students and workers protested against their government. The death toll was not clear. Some said 200-300 people died. Others said 2,000-3,000 people died. In Rwanda, Hutu groups killed many people, including those from another group called Tutsis. Hitler's government also killed many people during World War II. They killed anyone who was Jewish.",
            "Duke Ellington is a famous musician. His long career helped make him a great composer. Many of his songs show his good skills as a composer. He often wrote music that let band members show their skills. This was good for the band and made their music sound great. Ellington wrote music that fit the style of each band member. He made music that sounded good together.\n\nEllington’s piano playing is not very noticeable in some of his music. But he was a great composer. He wrote music that sounded rich and complex. He let band members play freely in his music. He also wrote tightly planned pieces that sounded great with the band.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary talks about Ellington’s music. It says he used voice like a musical instrument. This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to make his music sound better. One of his songs, Creole Love Call, is an early example of this. This song is a slow blues song with 12 parts. It has six parts where the voice and the band trade back and forth.\n\nIn the first part, the voice sings smoothly. Then it gets rough at the end. In the second part, a trumpet plays a solo. The trumpet makes the basic melody sound better. In the third part, a clarinet plays a solo. The piano plays a simple but nice rhythm. In the fourth part, the whole band plays the first part again. The brass and reed sections trade back and forth. In the fifth part, the reeds start to play the call and response in a high sound. The brass and rhythm sections play a funny stop-and-go rhythm. In the sixth part, the voice and reeds trade back and forth again. This time the voice sounds like a special growl.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to make his music sound better is one thing he did well. Another example is in the song Hot and Bothered. He wrote tight music and used his ear to make his music sound good. He made a call and response part between a trumpet and a singer. The singer sang in a funny way and the trumpet player played in a special way. This made their music sound rich and good. He also used a trombone player to make the music sound good in another song.\n\nEllington’s use of voice and his good ear for music made his music sound great. He was a great composer and musician.",

She wanted a person, not a thing. But she was not interested in any boys. Many boys liked her, but none of them interested her. She often asked herself, \"What is it that I want?\" She thought about this for a long time. She thought maybe it was a boy, but she didn't think so.\n\nThis girl was very lucky.

            "This study wanted to see if following a special way of eating, called the Mediterranean Diet, can help prevent heart disease and strokes. The study looked at how well women followed this diet. The Mediterranean Diet is a way of eating that includes many plant foods, nuts, fruits, whole grains, and fish. It also includes some alcohol, but less animal products and fat.\n\nPast studies showed that people who followed this diet were less likely to die from heart disease and other heart problems. This new study wanted to see if it could prevent strokes and deaths from strokes.\n\nThe study looked at 74,886 women between 38 and 63 years old who did not have heart disease or diabetes. The women were part of a big study of nurses in 11 states. The women answered questions about what they ate six times between 1984 and 2004. The answers were used to create a score that showed how well they followed the Mediterranean Diet.\n\nThe study also looked at other things that might affect the results, like how much the women weighed, if they smoked, and how much they exercised. The study adjusted for these things to get a clearer picture.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet more closely were less likely to get heart disease and strokes. They were also less likely to die from these diseases. Women who followed the diet the most were 71% less likely to get heart disease and strokes compared to those who followed it the least.",
            "In 2007, the United States had a very bad financial problem. Many people lost their jobs, and the value of homes fell. Some very big companies failed. This situation is still bad today. We need to know how this happened and how to stop it.\n\nThe financial crisis was caused by bad decisions made by people in government. They wanted banks and companies to give loans to people who could not pay them back. This was done in a country with weak financial systems. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two big companies, were asked to make these bad loans into something called CDOs.\n\nWhen people could not pay their loans, banks lost money. They sold the bad loans to other companies and to the rest of the economy. This caused big problems.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis started in 1999. President Clinton wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular, so he loosened rules about lending. This helped create the problem of bad loans seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times said at that time, “Fannie Mae is giving more loans to people who cannot pay them back.” He said this could cause big problems in the future.\n\nMany things happened together to make the economy very bad. New types of mortgages made things worse. These were mortgages that could change their interest rates, and they were very complicated. This made people and banks take too many risks.\n\nThe value of homes fell, and many people could not pay their mortgages. The big banks that had these bad loans were in big trouble. In 2007, these banks had $4.1 trillion in bad debts. This was 30% of the total value of the United States.\n\nFour big banks, Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and Goldman Sachs, lost a lot of money. They were forced to change what they did. Fannie and Freddie had $5 trillion in bad loans and were taken over by the government.",
            "Exposition is a part of writing that can be tricky. It is the part where you tell your readers about events and things that happened before the main story starts. But too much exposition can be boring. It is like a long, slow walk on a quiet street. You might start to feel sleepy.\n\nThe problem with exposition is that it is easy to use too much. You might think, \"I want to tell you everything about this character.\" But the reader does not need to know everything. They just need to know what is important.\n\nImagine you are reading a story and you are told that the heroine met her husband at a party, got married in a big ceremony, and then he was murdered in front of her. That would take a lot of time. The writer would have to tell you a lot of details. But it would be better to show you this part of the story instead of just telling you. For example, you could see how the heroine and her husband talk to each other. You could see how much they love each other. This way, you would care about what happens to him when he dies.\n\nAs a writer, you have to give your readers the right amount of information. You do not want to give them too much or too little. If you give them too much, they might get bored. If you give them too little, they might not understand what is happening.\n\nIt is like cooking a meal. You have to put the right amount of salt and pepper in the food so it tastes good. If you put too much salt, it is too salty. If you put too little salt, it is not tasty.\n\nSo, remember, as a writer, you need to be careful with exposition.

            "I watched two news shows from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. The man's name is Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture and he looked very bad. They spent two minutes on this story. The wife was hurt badly and the man was arrested. I think they spent the right amount of time on this story.\n\nThe next story was about a boy named Travis Buyers, 18, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was very badly hurt but no one was arrested yet. The police were investigating. This story was short. I think it was short because the boy is black and lives in a black neighborhood. I noticed that when a white person is hurt or missing, the news talks about it a lot. But when a minority person is hurt or missing, it is not talked about as much.\n\nThe next story was about a hole in a helicopter. The police think a small bullet from a rifle hit the helicopter. They are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for information about who did it.\n\nThe next story was about the weather. They said it would be hot and stormy on Saturday afternoon. The temperature would be high.\n\nThe next story was about a robbery at a Clime Road store. The police said a tall, black man with a black hoodie robbed the store. They spent a lot of time talking about how black the man was. This seemed strange.\n\nThe next story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He is a convicted drug dealer from Texas. He was sent to prison for 300 months. They also said he is Hispanic. I don't think this was important to the story.",
            "There is a special feeling between brothers. It is strong and hard to break. This feeling has many parts: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers know each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brother. This bond is clear when things get very bad. When brothers see the good or bad things in their bond, they have to deal with the results. When one brother looks at another and sees himself, he sees who he really is. He sees his true character in his actions and what happens because of them.\n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers explore this idea. They go on a journey through a beautiful place. They are very different. One brother is very sick and can't do many things. The healthy brother is very disappointed. He wanted a brother to play with and learn from. He wanted someone to be with him in exciting activities. But the sick brother can't do those things. The healthy brother feels angry and sad. He even thought about hurting his brother. But when his brother smiles, he feels a little better. This shows that he loves his brother.\n\nThe story is about a boy named Doodle. He is sick and can't play like other children. His brother wants to teach him things, but Doodle can't do them. The brother feels sad and angry because his brother can't be what he wants him to be. But when Doodle smiles, his brother feels a little better.\n\nThe story shows how brothers feel about each other. They can love and be angry at the same time. They can see themselves in their brother and learn about themselves. The story is about the special bond between brothers.",
            "The brain is a very important and complicated system. It helps us think and remember.  Long ago, people thought of the brain like a slate, a piece of paper, and a book. Later, they thought of it like a computer. But these pictures are not very good. They can lead to mistakes.\n\nThe brain works like a machine. It takes in information from our senses. Our senses feel, see, and hear things. They turn these things into signals that the brain can understand. The brain then changes these signals many times. This is called processing. There are two kinds of processing: one goes from simple to complex, and the other uses the brain's decisions to help us recognize things faster.\n\nFor example, when you see a picture of a box, the brain puts together small pieces of information like color and shape. Then it decides that you are seeing a box. The brain also uses what it already knows to help you decide that it's a box and not a hole. It's like your brain is helping your brain.\n\nThe brain has a filter that decides which signals are important. It sends the important signals to the right parts of the brain. For example, you might hear many different sounds, but you only pay attention to the sound of your name. The brain has many steps of processing, and it repeats this filtering many times.\n\nThe brain needs to store information to process it. There are three kinds of memory: short-term, working, and long-term. Short-term memory is like a computer screen. It keeps information for a short time, like 20 seconds. Working memory is like a computer program that stores information for a short time. Long-term memory is like a computer that stores information forever.\n\nThere are many ways to understand how the brain stores information. Some scientists study how people remember things. Others study computers. Still, others study how the brain works. One idea is that the brain has a network of ideas. Each idea is connected to other ideas like it. For example, the idea of a chair is connected to the idea of a table, which is connected to the idea of wood.",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of technology and capitalism in his novel Brave New World. He creates a society where people value community over individual freedom. They are taught from birth to be happy and not think too much. The citizens are like pawns in a game, controlled by the World Controller. Huxley is worried about the future and the way people are being treated.\n\nIn Brave New World, people are not thinking for themselves. They are controlled by the people in charge. This is like the idea of false consciousness in Marxism. The common people do not know about the relationship between different groups in society. They are too busy thinking about themselves. This is because the people in charge control what they think and do. The lower classes are not aware of this. They are happy to buy and consume, and do not think about the system they live in. The people in charge are also not doing anything to change things. They just accept their position.\n\nIn Brave New World, people do not have deep relationships. They do not have strong feelings like love or hate. They just talk about physical things, like how someone looks. This is because they are not allowed to have deep feelings. The people in the different social classes are happy with their place in society. This shows how capitalism affects people's lives. They do not think about anything else, and just follow the rules.\n\nHuxley is saying that technology and capitalism take away people's free will and individuality. People are not allowed to be different or think for themselves. They just do what they are told. This is what Huxley is trying to show in his novel.",
            "I have been a student at University Park for about two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. In my first year, I lived in East Halls, a place far from the center of campus. My home in Stuart Hall was very far from my classes in Willard building. It took 25 minutes to walk from my home to class, especially on bad days. I met an older student and asked about the old East Halls dorms. He told me they were once far from the rest of the school. Now, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. As the campus grows, getting around becomes harder. The best way to solve this problem is with bicycles. But it is not just about the bike. Students need to ride them, and the campus must be made for cyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who started riding again after a few years. He said, \"Bikes are great. It is the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and the most efficient way to travel. You can go 30 miles or more with a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise. I live off campus, far from the center of campus. I bought a bike this year and it was a smart decision. I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding my bike takes only 5 minutes. However, Pollock Road is not a safe road to ride on. Walking is also good, but I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, I would have to walk to class, which would take 30-40 minutes every day. That is two and a half hours every week. I do not have that much time."
