            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems called insomnia. The first way is biological. It looks at what the body does and what happens when it is not working right. This includes things like genes and the body's health. The second way is sociocultural. It looks at how the world around us affects our sleep. This includes things like culture, race, and our economic situation.\n\nInsomnia can be caused by different things. It can be a primary problem, a problem that is connected to another mental health issue, or a problem caused by a medical condition or something we put into our body.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at how our bodies work. Our genes and brain cells help us sleep and stay awake. A study on mice found that special receptors in the brain help us sleep and wake up. If these receptors are not working right, we can have trouble sleeping. A medicine that helps these receptors work better made the mice sleep longer.\n\nThis study shows that our genes and the world around us can affect our sleep. If we are born with a problem with these receptors, we may have trouble sleeping. This can affect our daily life and make it hard to focus and do things.\n\nThe sociocultural model of sleep problems looks at how the world around us affects our sleep. This includes things like our family, friends, and where we live. Insomnia can be caused by different things like our culture, our economic situation, and our age.\n\nFor example, a study found that people in some cultures sleep less than people in other cultures. This can be because of the way they live or the things they do. A person's economic situation can also affect their sleep. If they do not have a good place to live or are worried about money, they may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe strengths of these studies are that they help us understand why people have insomnia and how to treat it. However, they also have weaknesses. They do not always explain why people have insomnia and they do not always work for everyone.",
            "**Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)**\n\n**What is CAPD?**\n\nCAPD is a disorder that affects how the brain uses sound information. It is not the same as hearing loss. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding and processing them. This can make it hard to understand speech, especially in noisy places.\n\n**History of CAPD**\n\nThe idea of CAPD started in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. In 1954, a team of researchers began creating tests for these children. In 1961, another researcher created a test to check how the brain processes sound. A big meeting in 1977 helped researchers learn more about CAPD.\n\n**How CAPD Affects People**\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. Some people with CAPD:\n\n- Have trouble finding the source of a sound\n- Have trouble telling two or more sounds apart\n- Have trouble recognizing patterns in sounds\n- Have trouble understanding changes in speech\n- Have trouble hearing one sound when another sound comes after it\n- Have trouble putting together sound clues\n- Have trouble understanding the order of sounds\n\n**Diagnosing CAPD**\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a professional must watch how a person behaves when listening and give them tests to check their listening abilities. These tests can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no one test that can diagnose CAPD for sure, and we do not know what causes it.\n\n**Helping Students with CAPD in the Classroom**\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in many ways. They can:\n\n- Give students extra time to understand instructions\n- Use visual aids to help them understand\n- Minimize background noise in the classroom\n- Encourage students to ask for help when they do not understand\n- Use simple language and repeat instructions\n- Provide extra help when needed",

When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. The German government had done a good job in educating them. But in South West Africa, the situation was very different.\n\nMost Africans in South West Africa were not educated. They could not read or write. The government did not help much with education. Instead, missionary groups tried to educate the Africans. The government gave them some money, but not much. They also helped European students a lot. They built schools for them and controlled the schools that the missionaries ran. This made a big difference in South West Africa. Other German colonies had many educated Africans, but South West Africa did not.\n\nWhy was South West Africa so different? There were many reasons. We want to find out what these reasons were. We also want to look at how the people who lived in the colonies and the government thought about the Africans. There is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some people have written about the differences in education in the different colonies. One important study is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was one reason why education was different there.\n\nSouth West Africa was a relatively nice place to live. It was not too hot and not too cold. Many Europeans moved there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. This was a lot more than in other colonies.",
            "Music called Popular Music has grown a lot over 100 years. It now includes many kinds. It is hard to make a list of all kinds. Many kinds of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, have smaller kinds. Heavy Metal rock is a popular kind of music now. It is special because it shows a wide range of feelings. It often shows darker feelings. Many people started their own kind of Heavy Metal music. This made many smaller kinds of music. This chain of kinds continues today.\n\nHeavy metal music today is hard to understand. It has many different kinds of music. It has taken ideas from other kinds of music. But it started from something. To understand heavy metal music now, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy Metal music is often dark. It is often loud and wild. It is often about strong feelings. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at their instruments. This is clear in the music. Heavy Metal music also started with people taking drugs. There was a big time when people took drugs in the 1970s. This led to people making strange and crazy music. They used the drugs as an excuse for their music. Heavy Metal music has many dark qualities. This was new in popular music. Later, younger Heavy Metal groups took ideas from the past. They made music with dark and wild ideas. Some examples of this are in the song \"Helter Skelter\". This song shows the dark side of the Beatles. It is like a rollercoaster with ups and downs. Some people think this is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles wrote it as a challenge to another group, the Rolling Stones. They wanted to show they could make loud and dark music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous French painter. He made his paintings in a style called Post-Impressionism. His painting called \"The Dream\" shows a woman looking at a beautiful place in her dreams. This painting is also about Rousseau's own dreams and wishes.\n\nRousseau wanted many things in his life. He wanted other artists and people to accept and like his paintings. He wanted recognition and praise for his work. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he was not sure how to do it.\n\nTo understand \"The Dream\" better, we need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. Rousseau did not go to art school. He worked for the government in France for forty years. When his wife and eight children died, he was left with only one daughter. He was very sad. He started painting to feel better and to start a new life.\n\nRousseau was a folk painter. He painted about everyday people and things. He was like an average person, not a king or a rich person. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but it was very hard. Many other artists were famous and good. Rousseau started painting late in his life. He did not get famous until a man named Matisse became a famous artist.\n\nThe book Modern French Painters says that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Matisse did not want to make boring paintings. Rousseau wanted to make paintings that were so good that people would accept him as a real artist.",
            "Many people think that ethics and art are connected. They believe that truth and beauty are the same thing. A famous writer, John Keats, said this in a poem. He said that beauty and truth are the same thing, and that is all we need to know about them.\n\nWe learn many things in life through education and experience. But we know that ethics and art are special. They are not like things we learn in school. We appreciate them without being taught. Ethics and art are like descriptions of something, not rules to follow.\n\nWhen we talk about art or ethics, we try to explain what makes something good or beautiful. But we cannot fully explain it. We can talk about the colors, shapes, and textures of a painting. But in the end, that does not tell us why it is good art. When we talk about our favorite art or literature, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This is hard to explain.\n\nI think that ethics and art are similar in this way. No matter how well we describe something, there is something more that we cannot explain. A woman writer, Flannery O'Connor, said that stories are like this too. She said that stories are a way to say something that cannot be said in words.\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because they are both about something we feel deeply. They are not just things we learn in school. They are things we experience, but cannot fully explain. This is why we find ethics and art so important.\n\nA writer, McKean, said that literature is unique because it has a moral quality. Literature is about values. It is about what is right and wrong. We find values in literature and in life. We like literature because it helps us understand what is important.",
            "Germany is a strong country. It is a united place with a special culture. This culture is felt from the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It is also felt in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nThis unique culture comes from many different groups and tribes. Germany has a long history. People have lived there for a long time.\n\nThe place called Germania is the home of the Germans. But where did the name Germania come from? Many scholars and historians do not agree. One historian said the name came from a group of people called the Tungrians. They were a Germanic tribe that lived on the other side of the Rhine River.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book. He used the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about the wars with the Gauls. He took this word from the Gauls themselves. Caesar used it to show the difference between the Gauls and the Germans.\n\nSome people think the name Germania came from a spear that the Germans used in battles. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This might mean the Germans were loud. \n\nA historian named Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He said the Germans were the original people of the area. They did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild country with bad weather and tough people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germania. They would go there to get goods and to fight battles. They would then go back to their big empire. The Germanic tribes lived on the border of the Roman Empire. They would trade with the Romans and fight for them.",
            "I stood still, looking at the picture in front of me. My mind was not working well. I did not understand the scene. It was like looking at something new and strange. Ideas came into my mind, but they went away quickly. My mind was like a calm and clear stream, but it had no thoughts. \n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw. When I was six years old, I started to think about it. I found a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people how to draw. The book says to put a square around a picture to make it easier to understand. This helps us see the main things in the picture. I tried to do this, but I could not. The picture in front of me was too complicated. I was too surprised and amazed. I just stood and looked at it. \n\nArtists have different styles. Picasso used blue, Monet liked green and yellow. The old Italian artists used many colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, I had to start by looking at this picture. This could be the start of my art. I called it \"Work in Brown.\" I picked up a pencil and started to draw. My hand moved smoothly over the paper. I was in a good place, creating something new. But then my hand jerked and went to the toilet handle. I had to clean up a mess. Someone had left a big, brown pile of waste in the toilet. I used a mop to clean it up. I was not happy about it. I wore a green tie and my feet were apart. I stared at the mess and thought about it. I made my hand into a glove to protect it from the mess. Then I put my hand into the toilet and cleaned it up.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several factors cause this problem. The brain of a teenager is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teenagers do not have enough experience. This lack of experience causes many more accidents and makes them drive too fast, drive off the road, or turn over their cars. Teenagers also drive worse when their friends are with them.\n\nA study in California found that how old the passenger is and how many traffic accidents happen are connected. To make driving safer for teenagers, some states give them temporary licenses that limit how many hours they can drive and do not allow them to drive with other minors.\n\nBut these temporary licenses are not a long-term solution. The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young for a driver's license. He did research that shows many young people want to take risks and do exciting things. This means that teenagers should not drive until they are a little older and are less likely to take risks. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more people will be killed in car accidents.\n\nA simple law could solve this problem. Schools could teach driver's education classes to help teenagers learn how to drive. No one under 18 could drive a car. Before getting a full driver's license, teenagers could get a temporary permit and practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours could be the same as in most states. Because many states have similar problems, a national law would be a good way to make driving safer for teenagers.\n\nThis idea is not new. Many states have already tried it. It would work and save many lives.",
            "I looked at movies from the early days of film at the Library of Congress. I wanted to watch all the trick films. These films were made between eighteen ninety-five and nineteen hundred one. There were fifteen of them. Trick films use editing to create illusions. My study of film looked at how trick films use creative editing to make people believe what they see. I also looked at how some films from the end of the nineteenth century began to break the rules of film-making.\n\nOne thing that many trick films have in common is that they were made in a studio with a stage in the front. The camera does not move from this position to follow people or objects. This style of making films came from the theatre and magic shows. Because of this style, people in the films usually do not move towards or away from the camera. In the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" actors enter from one side and move back and forth. They stay in the same place. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame.\n\nMost trick films use long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are not used in these films. This is because in theatre and magic shows, the audience sees the entire performance at one time. In early films, actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are not possible.\n\nMost trick films are short, about one minute or less. They focus on simple tricks, like magic or disappearing acts. But sometimes, one conceptual shot in a film can be made up of several physical shots. For example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" is part of a single conceptual shot.",
            "John Taylor was a well-known American. He liked farming. He was a strong supporter of the Republican party. Taylor was for personal freedom and against a big government. He believed that farming was the best kind of work. His ideas about farming helped form his opinions on government. He thought the government should not interfere with people's lives.\n\nTaylor believed America had a great chance to make a perfect government. The country was new, so there were no old ideas to get in the way. He believed people have natural rights. These rights are important and should be protected. If one person's rights are taken, all people's rights are at risk.\n\nTaylor said that in the wild, strong people and mean people do well. But in a society, this should not be true. He believed a good government should understand that people are good and bad. He thought good principles are important for a government. Good principles protect private property and help farmers. They also make sure people do not take advantage of others. A good government will work well even if its leaders are not perfect. Leaders are often led by selfishness.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is strict and follows the Constitution. He did not want a big government with many powers. He thought a big government is expensive and can be evil. But he also believed that a simple reading of the Constitution can be bad if it does not consider the writers' intentions. Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence is the real charter of the United States. It says the country is a group of separate states, not one country.",
            "A look at the numbers shows a big drop in people using the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a little disappointing. It is not easy to say why this happened.\n\nWinter was coming to the school. Many people were riding bicycles or walking less. This might explain some of the drop. December is a busy time for students and teachers. They are finishing their work and preparing for grades. They might forget to use the commuter log. In December, people also start thinking about holidays. This means many students and teachers do not need to come to school for a month. Classes start again in late January. This might also be the reason for the low numbers. But we still do not know why the numbers were low in February.\n\nOne idea is that all projects have a lot of energy at the start. Then the energy goes down. We tried to fix this by creating a special week to use the log more, called Carpool Challenge Week in March. This worked and more people used the log in March.\n\nAnother problem we faced was that people like to drive cars. It is a part of our culture. We need to give people good reasons to use other ways to get to school. We gave prizes like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and a bookstore. It would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bicycle or a new car. This might have stopped the decline in participation.\n\nThe prizes we gave out did not change much. If we had increased the prizes as the project went on, this might have helped. The gift cards were good at first, but adding bigger prizes in December and January might have made people want to use the log more.",
            "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a kind of investment. It follows an index, a group of stocks, or a basket of assets. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on the stock market. An ETF gives you the benefits of owning many stocks together and the freedom to make decisions like buying or selling quickly. It also has lower costs than many other kinds of investments.\n\nThe benefits of ETFs are attractive. But there are some downsides. You have to pay a fee for each trade, like you would for buying or selling a stock. There are also many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nThis text will look at one ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up most of the ETF. We want to know if owning the ETF is like owning the top 10 stocks combined. We also want to see if there are better ways to combine these stocks for better results.\n\nTo make our report easier to read, we will only look at the top 10 stocks. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 stocks and how much they make up of the entire ETF.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the whole ETF, we will use a chart. The chart shows how much each stock contributes to the ETF's performance. We will also see how much each stock contributes to the ETF's risk.\n\nOur chart shows that a portfolio of only the top 10 stocks would earn 6.11% more than the ETF. It would also be less sensitive to market movements. This means that the top 10 stocks might be a good choice for some investors. But we need to be sure that these results are not just a coincidence.\n\nTo do this, we will look at the standard deviation of each stock. Standard deviation shows us how much a stock can move up or down in value. We will compare the standard deviation of the top 10 stocks to the standard deviation of the ETF IHF. This will help us know if owning the ETF or the top 10 stocks is the better choice.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land\". It is one of his best works. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 of the poem. This word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil. Virgil used it to name a island north of Britain, which the Greeks thought was the edge of the world.\n\nBut Poe was also influenced by another writer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It tells a story about a king who loses his wife and drinks too much, remembering her. The king then decides to die.\n\nPoe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is similar to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\". They both describe a sad and lonely place called Thulé. The place is dark and without color. The speaker in Poe's poem is haunted by dead friends. This is like the king in Goethe's poem, who is lonely and sad after losing his wife.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe probably knew about. Poe admired a writer named Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and it is likely Poe was also familiar with Goethe's work. Many copies of Goethe's books were made after its first publication. Poe was interested in German writers, and Goethe was one of the most famous German writers of his time.\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in his writings. Once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as the beginning and ending of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together as two related poems. They both describe a sad and lonely place.",
            "In California law, can a customer hurt in a store get extra money as punishment? This customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell in a store after an applesauce spill. She was hurt badly. She thinks the store manager, Paul Martin, was mean on purpose because he knew about the spill twice and did not clean it for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner. Can she prove this in court?\n\nA judge will not throw out Palmer's claim for extra money right away. To get extra money, Palmer must show that Martin was very aware of the harm he could cause and was very careless. She can tell the judge that Martin knew many people were hurt in the store before she fell. He knew this because many people slipped and fell in the store in the past months. But Martin still did nothing to make the store safe. Palmer will argue that Martin was very bad because he did not clean up the spill. But it is not clear how bad he was.\n\nHere are the facts of the case. On October 13, 2009, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, told Martin about the spill. He said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. Before that, five people slipped and fell in the store in 2009.\n\nPalmer is suing D&D Markets for money because of her injury. Now, we are thinking about asking the judge to throw out part of her claim for extra money. In California, a person can get extra money if the other person was very mean or did something wrong on purpose. This means the other person must have meant to cause harm, or they must have done something very bad and very careless.\n\nTo prove that Martin was very mean, Palmer must show that he was aware of the harm he could cause and still did nothing to stop it. The law says that if a person is very aware of the harm they can cause and still does not stop it, that is very bad. In a past case, a court said that this kind of behavior is very mean.\n\nWe are trying to decide if Palmer can prove that Martin was very mean. We will see if she can show that he knew about the harm he could cause and still did nothing to stop it.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC four years ago. There was a big discussion in class about whether Islam is a hostile religion. I still think this question is very important today. Many events since the September 11 attacks have shown me that the media's view of Islam has changed. It used to be very negative, but now it is very positive.\n\nI think it is interesting to read the biography of the Prophet Muhammad. What I have learned about Muhammad's history does not match the picture of him in the biography. I used to think that Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would conquer and take control of tribes, and then make them become Muslims. But the biography writes about Muhammad as a kind and humble person. More and more people were attracted to his teachings because they saw his kindness and truth.\n\nThere are some strange similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad. One example is when Muhammad took a little food and made it enough for many people. The way this story is written makes me think that the authors wanted Muhammad to seem like a kind and humble prophet who did not need to prove anything. This makes me think that they are taking away from the miracles and teachings of Jesus. It is like they are trying to take credit for Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nI also have a problem with the stories in the biography. Many of the stories are not from the people who actually saw these things happen. They are told to us by someone who heard it from someone else. This makes me think that the stories are not true.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is that the biography shows Muhammad as a very kind and humble person. But history tells us that this is not true. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A long time ago, Jesus taught us many things. But his teachings were soon left behind. People continued to think about Jesus and his ideas in different ways. If we look at history, we see a big change. The ideas that Jesus taught are no longer the same as what people believe today.\n\nMost people believe in one God. This idea started with the Jewish people. The Jewish people were a group divided into many parts. They had different ideas about how to live their lives.\n\nThe Jewish people had many different groups. The Sadducees were one group. The Pharisees were another. The Essenes and the Zealots were groups too. Most people were just common people.\n\nThe Roman Empire took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not the same. They had many different ideas.\n\nToday, we see that many people are thinking about Jesus' ideas again. They want to go back to what he originally taught. This will take time. It may take many years or even many centuries. But it will happen. People will start to remove extra ideas that were added to Christianity. They will go back to what Jesus taught.\n\nWhen this starts to happen, people will begin to believe the same things again. They will no longer have many different ideas. This will happen in the United States and Europe. It will happen in all the Christian groups.\n\nThis is not a new thing. It has happened before. Many years ago, the Roman Empire was against the Christians. But later, the Roman Empire became a Christian group. Our country has changed many times. We used to treat African-Americans as slaves. Now we have African-American leaders.\n\nThe same thing will happen in the Christian religion. It will go back to what Jesus taught. To understand what Jesus said, people will read his words as symbols, not as exact statements.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus lived? If we go far back in time, we see only Judaism. This was the base of the Christian religion. The Jewish people believed in one God. They believed that God gave them special messages. And they believed in the Jewish scriptures.",
            "I think the book \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally selfish. They want to live good lives, but they do not think about others. This is shown many times in the book. The owners and managers of factories want to make their companies big and strong. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care about pollution or hurting animals and people.\n\nAccording to the book, the factories are very dirty. The smoke they make goes up into the air and hurts people. The owners do not care about this. They also do not care about the animals that live nearby. They do not care about the people who work for them. The owners want to get rich and will do anything to do it. They make their workers work too much and then they lay them off without giving them any help. The workers have no protection and are treated very badly.\n\nThe workers were like slaves. They were very poor and had no way to escape their bad situation. They were dependent on the factory owners who were very mean and did not care about them. This made a lot of problems in the community.\n\nThe book says that this is like slavery. The workers were treated very badly and had no rights. This made it hard for them to live a good life. The book shows that people need to be kind and think about others, not just themselves.",
            "Many writers use special techniques to make readers feel a certain way about important ideas. These techniques can be very effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example, uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs a word with its meaning that is not usually together to give readers a certain feeling. He also uses symbols to represent ideas and uses them again later to give readers a reminder of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses many colors in a special way. He gives meanings to colors like white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning of white and gray, and then uses it to describe important things.\n\nFitzgerald says white is better and more nice, and gray is older and less nice. He uses these words a lot in the beginning of the book. Many people wear white clothes: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white pants, and Tom wears a white shirt. The only time people do not wear white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party. The party is colorful and bright.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. He says some people and places are white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had a happy white childhood together, but later, Daisy is just a white car and a white dress, showing she is not a special person.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show readers that some people are not important. He uses these colors to describe Daisy in a way that makes her seem like just a normal thing. For example, he describes her wearing a white dress and a gray fur collar. He uses white and gray to show readers that Daisy is not a special character.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with other colors too. He gives meanings to red and pink and uses them to describe important things. He wants readers to feel a certain way about these colors and things.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The climate is warm and sunny. Farmers grow many things here. They grow tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. Many people want to buy food from local farms. There is a big market for organic food in San Diego. This means people want food grown without chemicals. They want organic eggs and milk too. Some farms give tours and let people visit their land. They can walk, watch birds, and have fun.\n\nThis kind of farm is good for the land and for people. The government gives money to farmers who take care of the land. They can also have people visit their farm and learn about farming. But organic farming is harder than other kinds of farming. It needs more work to get rid of bugs and weeds. Farmers need to use natural ways to make the soil good. This can be expensive. It is also harder to make money than with big farms. Small farms need more help to be profitable.\n\nA farm in San Diego County is a good place to talk about this. The farm is near a town called Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The land is near a forest. Many animals live here. Some are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are getting less common and might be in danger soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. First, Native Americans lived here. Then, in the late 1800s, cattle ranchers and people who sold wood came. The land was used for grazing and making wood.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a farm in the area. I looked at government programs to see how a small farmer can save money and help the animals. I used a real farm as an example of what someone might do.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any kind of negotiation. Culture is not the same thing everywhere and is not a single thing. We cannot say all people from one country are the same. Understanding a culture is harder than making a general statement about it. It is more useful for a negotiator to know how a culture affects a negotiation and how its values can help or hurt the talks.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. We make judgments based on what we know. But it is better to accept a culture as it is and work within its rules. This is especially true when you are in a weaker position in a negotiation. If you are in a different place and country, showing respect for their traditions and values can help you have a successful negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. This can be seen in how they dress, how they talk, and who they hire. Some companies work long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. Some people work together and help each other, while others work alone.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because it helps us know why people do things. If a culture values saving face, a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or boss. If a culture values making a good deal, a negotiator will not give up easily. Knowing these things can help you have a successful negotiation.\n\nBefore you start negotiating, it is a good idea to learn a little about the other person. This can help you make a good deal. Knowing about the other person's values and culture can help you be a good negotiator.",
            "People say, \"There is no God.\" This is from the Bible in Psalm 14. A man named St. Anselm used this idea. Another man, Thomas Aquinas, also believed in God. Both men wrote about why God exists. We want to know who is right.\n\nWe will start by saying we think they are both right. This way, we can compare their ideas about God. If we allow them to believe in a different kind of God, it's hard to compare their arguments.\n\nSt. Anselm said people can find God in their own minds. He said we cannot think about God not being real. This means God exists because we can think about him. We don't need to look outside ourselves for proof. This idea is called faith. It means believing something is true, even if we can't show it to others.\n\nThomas Aquinas said people can use reason and evidence to know God exists. He didn't need faith. He used five arguments to prove God's existence: change, cause, chance, order, and harmony. He said we can know God exists by thinking about these things.\n\nFor example, if you're given a puzzle with all the pieces except one, you can still know what the missing piece looks like. You don't need to see it to know it exists.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince named Siddhartha was born. He would one day be called the Buddha, which means the leader who has found truth. Before he was the Buddha, he renounced the world and became very wise. His teachings created the religion of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is now about two and a half thousand years old. It looks different from when the Buddha was alive. In the country of Sri Lanka, people celebrate an annual ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is important for the people who follow Theravada Buddhism, a main part of Buddhism.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas about the religion over time. This is because of forces inside the community and from outside. Some forces are good for Buddhism, and some are bad.\n\nSome words are used many times in this discussion. These words are internal, external, hostile, and benign. Internal means something comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something comes from outside the group. Hostile means something is bad for Buddhism. Benign means something is not bad for Buddhism.\n\nLet's learn about the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha's teachings are in three groups of text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the important talks of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and the universe.\n\nBuddhists believe in some important ideas. These ideas are that there is no permanent soul, that life has suffering, and that everything changes. These ideas help people escape the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. When people become enlightened, they will no longer have desire, hatred, and delusion.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Laymen have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take what is not given, do not have sex with someone who is not your partner, and do not take drugs. Monks have many more rules.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "A long time ago, the United States and Mexico were enemies for 57 years. This started in 1836 and ended in 1893. The biggest problem between them happened during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and took over some land from Mexico. This included Texas and the southwest part of the United States.\n\nMany small fights happened between the two countries. But they stopped just before World War I. The reason for the long fight was that Americans and Mexicans had different ideas about religion, culture and tradition. They also had different interests.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have problems. They have different interests and ideas, which can cause disagreements. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have long-standing problems with their neighbors.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher said, \"The United States has long-standing problems with Mexico and Cuba\" (p. 41). Both of these countries are close to the United States and have been enemies. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nA problem between the United States and Mexico was about religion. Many years ago, Americans were against Catholicism and monarchies. This was also true during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union were enemies. But this time, the problem was about the two countries' different religious ideas.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not trust each other because of the way the English and Spanish treated them in the past. This made it hard for them to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts listed 17 problems between the United States and Mexico during the 57-year fight. Most of these problems were about land and border issues. There were many fights between bandits and outlaws from one side of the border to the other. But when the United States and Mexico used force to control their borders, the problem started to go away.\n\nSchmitt said the problem started to go away when Mexico needed the United States for help (p. 109). The United States also changed its goals from getting more land to helping Mexico economically (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with a disease I did not know I had.\n\nI was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. I did not have those things when I was a child. My friends told me, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\"\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing. I am now 46 years old and single. I have no money. I am unable to work. To this day, I am sick. I get money from the government because I am unable to work. But after 15 years, I have nothing.\n\nI struggle every day to stay safe and happy. But I know one thing is true. I would not have made it without the help of my family and friends. They were strong and helped me when I was weak.\n\nMy point is this: bad things will happen in life. There are no guarantees. We must work together to help each other.\n\nI agree we should not rely too much on the government. But I think we should trust and help each other. This is how our country was built. Our ancestors helped each other and shared what they had.\n\nThey did not cross the country alone. They helped each other and worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am prepared. I have a special bag with food, water, and a first aid kit. I have flashlights and candles in case of a power outage. But most importantly, get to know your neighbors. They can help you when you need it.",
            "The question is: Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that control how they change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now, zoologists do not know how to describe simple forms in math.\" This is still true today. Recently, scientists used math to study how mollusks grow their skeletons.\n\nOur study is trying to figure out how to use math and experiments to learn about how living things change over time. We are studying a group of animals called Prunum. We used special pictures of their skeletons to create math formulas. These formulas can help us understand how their skeletons changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space as the animal grows. The shell has many turns, called whorls. Each whorl is like a spiral that grows around a center line. The speed at which the whorls grow can be different. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The other whorls are called the spire. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. When we see the opening of the shell, it is called an apertural view. When we see the top of the shell, it is called an apical view.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top and draw a line where the first suture starts. We can then count the whorls from that line. We can also use math to draw a path of the shell's growth.\n\nThis path can be represented mathematically and graphically. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how the mollusk's skeleton grows.",
            "Indonesia's rate of baby and child deaths has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in some areas, but not enough to meet its goals for child and mother health by 2015.  There are many reasons for this problem.  These reasons will be discussed below.  They show that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger, not just improve programs for specific health problems.\n\nIndonesia is doing better in getting skilled health workers to deliver babies.  Now, 72% of births have a skilled worker present.  But this number includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there are problems during delivery.  So, improvements in this area are not as good as they seem.  In addition, fewer children under five with diarrhea are being treated by health professionals. Data on taking care of new mothers is also incomplete, but it shows that this is a big problem.\n\nToo few babies are delivered by C-section.  This is 4% of all births.  This number shows another problem.  In cities, 7% of babies are delivered by C-section.  But in the countryside, it is only 2%.  This means that healthcare is not available equally across the country.  People in cities are getting better healthcare than people in the countryside.\n\nAnother problem is that wealthy people are getting better healthcare than poor people.  There is a 27% gap in how often people use healthcare services, depending on how much money they have.  Poor people are not using healthcare services because they cannot afford it.\n\nSo, the question is how to improve healthcare for babies and mothers.  Should Indonesia make a plan to solve a specific problem, or should it make the healthcare system stronger?  Some people think that solving a specific problem is a good idea.  This approach has specific goals and can show fast results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  If Indonesia spends a lot of money on one health problem, it may not have enough money for other health problems.  Also, there may be too many programs doing the same thing, and they may not be working together.",
            "Two kinds of books are called Victorian novels. They are classics from a long time ago. These books are about the rich people of the time. But two books, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They have many strange and mysterious parts. These parts make the characters in the books more interesting. They help readers understand what the characters think and feel.\n\nIn one book, Oliver Twist, a boy named Oliver has many strange dreams. These dreams show what is inside Oliver's heart. They show his pain and what he knows about the world around him. In another part of the book, Oliver remembers a shooting. He relives the shooting in his mind, like he is dreaming. This shows how scared and helpless Oliver is. He had no control over what happened to him. He was forced to suffer pain and fear. This makes the reader think that Oliver feels like giving up. He has no power over what happens to him.\n\nAnother book, Wuthering Heights, is also a mystery. It has a strange and scary atmosphere. Time is not clear in this book. It is like day and night are mixed up. The days are very long, but they are also very short. The nights are very quiet, but they are also very brief.\n\nThese two books show that sometimes bad things happen to people. They have no control over these things. These books help readers understand how people feel when they are suffering.",
            "I worked with young students in an after-school program. They were in elementary school. I helped them with many subjects, but I was best with English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. He could say some words correctly, but others not. It was strange. He was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. I worked with him, but we had problems. Then I met his mother. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, but it was not very good. We talked a little bit. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet very well. I am not sure if this helped him, but I hope he is better now.\n\nI tell this story because many students have trouble with languages in school, especially in California. It is not always easy for students who speak English well to read. I think everyone knows this is a problem. What can we do? In Adrian's case, he needed help with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for students who do not speak English very well, the solution is more complicated. There is no one answer. We need a combination of things. These are the dual language system, mainstream classes, private tutors, ESL classes. None of these things will fix the problem by itself.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It is not just for students who speak Spanish. All students can benefit. Studies show that students in bilingual education programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all students will benefit. But how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages.",
            "We are told from a young age that there is something bigger than us in the world. Some people go to church or temple to learn about it. Others look inside themselves for answers. Many follow the same religion as their parents, but some people do not believe.\n\nWe search for our own path in life. We try to understand what is important to us. This is called our spirituality. We look for a way to guide us through life.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our front porch. It was raining. The sound of the rain on the roof was loud. My father looked out at the rain. He seemed sad. He was not eating much and was losing his hair. He looked thin.\n\nI wanted to talk to him about how I would miss him when he was gone. But I was afraid. Talking about it would make it more real. So I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out at the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December when I was twenty-two years old. He was sick for a long time. The doctors said he would not get better. But he lived a little longer because of medicine. I did not want to watch him die. I wanted to remember him when he was alive.\n\nI did not say any prayers when my father died. I did not think God was listening to me. I felt alone and sad. I curled up in my bed for three days. No one called me to ask how I was doing.",
            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is called an oxymoron, which means two things that do not go together. Ian Watt says this in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. \n\nIn the past, people did not like the Gothic novel. They said it had no real depth. But some people praised it for its spooky and exciting parts. The first Gothic novel was The Castle of Otranto. It was written by Horace Walpole. He used old and new ideas to create a new way of writing.\n\nWalpole used old theatrical ideas and new ideas from modern novels. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic novel uses many old ideas from medieval times. These ideas come from theater, buildings, and customs. People thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned when The Castle of Otranto was published. They thought it was not as good as modern ideas.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas makes the Gothic novel special. It is why the Gothic novel was popular for a long time and remains interesting even today. \n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a code of honor for knights. It was used in medieval times. The idea of chivalry is used in The Castle of Otranto. It is important because it represents what a good knight should be: brave, honest, and skilled. \n\nGothic writers used the idea of chivalry to say that the world had lost its good values. They wanted to remind people of the good old days. The writer of The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole, wrote during a time of political trouble. He was unhappy with the way society was. He thought that people had lost their good qualities. This idea is seen in his character, Frederic. He is a prince, a leader, and he has been through hard times. He is described as a gallant and courteous knight. This is an exaggeration, but it shows how the idea of chivalry was important in the Gothic novel.",
            "Supply chain management is the way goods move from the customer's order to the final product. This process includes moving goods from raw materials to the customer. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described the steps to follow to plan, implement, and control the supply chain to make customers happy quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base of the supply chain. Production decides how and when goods will be made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to understand customer needs. The market shows what customers want.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what goods to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make these goods. They choose a place that is good for making things in large amounts and with high quality, keeping customer needs in mind.\n\nAfter deciding where to make goods, managers focus on planning workloads and taking care of equipment. Production is a very important part of the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned well, it can cost the company time and money.\n\nFor example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of their business. They have a design for employee uniforms and a plan for receiving shipments from trucks. Having plans helps companies work smoothly and without confusion.\n\nThe second key part of supply chain management is supply. Supply is about making good decisions about a company's strengths and partnerships. A company may have many parts that make different things. Managers decide which part is best for each job. They may also decide to work with other companies to make things. This is called outsourcing. Companies outsource to save time and money.\n\nThe manager's goal is to make things quickly and at a low cost. This is called velocity.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head with a sad message. The sign says: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. The government there is very bad. Many people do not like the government.\n\nIn 2007, people in Burma started protesting. They were very unhappy with their government. The protests were led by many Buddhist monks. They wore yellow robes. The people of Burma started to support the monks. At first, the government allowed the monks to gather but then the government became angry. The government used force against the monks. The military invaded monasteries and hurt many people. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese reporter named Kenji Nagai was killed in 2007. He was reporting on the protests. Many people were killed. But few people know the real number. Colonel Hla Win said more than 13 people were killed. He said the number is in thousands.\n\nThis is not new. Governments want to control people and stop them from speaking out. This has been happening for a long time. In ancient Rome, the leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor is considered a god. Our president, George W. Bush, met with a man named Ted Haggard. He is a leader of a group that wants to help the government.\n\nThere are many examples of bad things that have happened. In 1989, many people in China were unhappy with their government. They gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed. But some groups said it was 2,000-3,000 people. In Rwanda, many people were killed in the 1990s. The government helped to kill people because of their ethnic group. Hitler's government in Germany was very bad. They killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington's music is famous because of his long life and his ability to make great music. He kept composing and directing his orchestra for a long time. Ellington was a good pianist, but he was a better composer. He wrote many complex pieces that showed the special talents of each musician in his orchestra. These pieces were often very good for soloists, who could improvise freely. Ellington also wrote pieces with strong melodies that suited each musician's style. He was very good at creating a good sound for his orchestra as a whole, making each piece unique.\n\nIn many pieces, Ellington used the voice as a musical instrument. He did this to add color and texture to his music. One early example is Creole Love Call, a slow blues piece. This piece has six parts. Each part is different, but they all work well together. In the first part, the singer and the reeds play a call-and-response pattern, with the singer singing smoothly and then more loudly. In the second part, a trumpet plays a solo. In the third part, a clarinet plays a fast, high melody, and the piano plays a syncopated pattern. The fourth part is like the first part, but with more instruments. In the fifth part, the reeds play the call-and-response pattern, and the brass and rhythm sections play together in a special way. In the sixth part, the singer and the reeds play the call-and-response pattern again, but this time the singer sounds like a saxophone. The last part is a short tag with a vocal run and a strange ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice in his music is just one example of his style. His music often has a lot of different sounds and textures, which makes it very interesting. He was a good composer because he knew how to use the special talents of each musician in his orchestra. He also knew how to create good sounds for his orchestra as a whole.\n\nIn his next pieces, such as Hot and Bothered, Ellington used his skill at writing tight compositions and his ear for sound color. In this piece, a call-and-response pattern between a trumpet and a singer creates a rich and complementary sound. In another piece, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington used a trombone to introduce the melody. These are just a few examples of Ellington's great ability to make music.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling started when she was fourteen and getting older. It was still there three years later, at seventeen. She wanted something, but she didn't know what. She wanted a person, not a thing. But she didn't like any boys. Some boys tried to show her attention, but she didn't feel anything.\n\nShe thought about this a lot. She tried to figure out what was wrong. She thought of different ideas, but none made sense. So she continued living her life, thinking about her feelings.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were good people. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her. They wanted her to be independent and have her own ideas. Her personality was strong, and her parents were calm. This made her a happy person.\n\nBut today was not a peaceful day. She walked around the house looking for ideas. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. She quickly went to the room and saw her mother on the floor in pain. Her mother was saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her mother and put a hand on her to help. \"I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother said. The daughter helped her mother to the car.\n\nAt the hospital, she smelled strong cleaning smells and sickness. She was too worried about her mother to be scared.

            "This study was to see if following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" helps prevent heart disease and stroke. The study looked at how a \"Mediterranean Diet Score\" relates to these problems. The Mediterranean Diet is a healthy eating plan that includes many plant foods, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains, and less saturated fat and animal products.\n\nPast studies showed that eating this way can help people live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke or stroke deaths. This new study wanted to find out more about the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old. These women were part of a big study of 121,700 nurses in 11 states in the US. The researchers counted how well each woman followed the Mediterranean Diet six times between 1984 and 2004. They used a food diary to ask the women about what they ate.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They also had a lower risk of death from heart disease or stroke. The women who ate this way were about 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThe researchers also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, and physical activity. They found that the women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely were less likely to have heart disease or stroke even after taking these factors into account.\n\nOverall, this study shows that following the Mediterranean Diet can help prevent heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "In the year two thousand seven, a big financial problem happened in the United States of America. Many people lost their jobs, the value of homes went down, and some very big companies went out of business. This problem is still happening today. We need to ask why this problem happened and how to stop it. \n\nThe financial problem was caused by bad choices made by leaders. They made banks and companies give loans to people who could not pay them back. These loans were given to people who did not have enough money. When these people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money to pay back the people who had given them the money. This made a big problem for the banks and the whole economy.\n\nA long time before this happened, in the year nineteen ninety-nine, the President of the United States wanted to stay in office for a second time. To do this, he made rules that made it easier for people to get loans. This made it more likely that people would not be able to pay back their loans. A man named Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote about this in nineteen ninety-nine. He said the company that makes many of the loans for homes, called Fannie Mae, was under pressure to make more loans to people who do not have a lot of money. This could cause problems in the future.\n\nThe problem with the loans was that some of them were not good. Some people got loans that they could not afford to pay back. This made the banks and the whole economy very sick. The banks had too much money tied up in these bad loans. When the people who took the loans could not pay them back, the banks lost a lot of money. This made a big problem for the economy.\n\nThe government and the banks made a system that was too complicated. They used many different kinds of loans and sold them to other people. This made it difficult for people to understand what was happening with their money. The banks and other companies got a lot of money from these loans, but they did not have enough money to pay back the people who had given them the money.\n\nThe problem was so big that many banks had a lot of debt. The top five banks in the United States had a total of four trillion dollars of debt. This is a very big number. The government had to step in to help the banks and the economy. The government took control of two big companies called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They had a lot of debt, five trillion dollars, and the government had to take care of it.",
            "Exposition is a problem for many writers. It is the part of a story where the writer tells too much about the past or a situation. This can be boring for the reader. They might fall asleep or stop reading. A writer's goal is to 'show' the reader what is happening, not 'tell' them.\n\nFor example, if a character meets someone and tells them too much about their past, this can be boring. It is better to show the reader how the character feels and what they think through their actions and words.\n\nThink about a story where a woman meets her husband. She tells the reader that they met, got married, and he was murdered in front of her. The reader might expect this to take two pages, but it would be better for the writer to show how the husband loves his wife and how she feels about him. This way, the reader can become emotionally involved and care about the story.\n\nA writer needs to add 'meat' to the story, not just bones. This means showing the reader the characters and their feelings, not just telling them about the plot.\n\nSometimes, it is tempting to rush past certain details. For instance, a character might tell the reader about their past, such as being in the Air Force or owning a gas station. But this can be boring. It is better to show the reader through the character's actions and words.\n\nA good writer knows how to balance telling and showing. They make the story interesting and engaging for the reader.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. His name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. The news program did not spend much time on this story. It said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nI think they spent the right amount of time on this story. \n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was very badly hurt. There was no one arrested yet. The police were investigating. This story seemed short. I think it was because the victim was a black man. In the past, I have noticed that when a black person is a victim of a crime, they do not get as much attention. \n\nThe news program talked about a hole in a helicopter. They said it was shot with a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward for information about the shooter.\n\nThey also said there will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be warm.\n\nThey talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road. A man robbed the store. The news program said he was a black man and was wearing a hoodie. They said he was tall and heavy. I thought they spent too much time talking about his skin color.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a drug dealer from Texas. He was convicted of selling marijuana in Ohio. The news program said he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. It is a connection that is very hard to break. Inside this connection, many feelings exist. They include love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They see themselves in their brother. When things are very bad, the true nature of this connection is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they can cause a lot of problems. To understand the feelings that come from being brothers, you must deal with the problems that come with them.\n\nWhen one brother looks at another and sees himself, he sees himself the way he really is. He sees his true character in his actions and the consequences of those actions. The story “The Scarlet Ibis” shows this connection between brothers. The story is about two brothers and the strong feelings that come with their bond. These two brothers go on a journey through a beautiful place. They have a lot of strong feelings, like pride and hurt. In the end, only one brother lives.\n\nThe story shows what the brothers feel through the main character, Doodle, and how he acts with his brother. It also shows the feelings of the narrator, who tells the story. The narrator's feelings influence how the main character sees the world. This affects how he acts.\n\nThe main character feels one strong feeling: pride. He takes his little brother, Doodle, on many adventures. But Doodle is very sick and cannot do the things the main character wants him to do. The main character is very unhappy about this. He wishes he had a brother he could teach and play with.

But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels happy. This shows that he truly loves his brother. He wants to help Doodle and make him happy.",
            "The brain is a very complicated part of our body. It helps us think and learn. As time has passed, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. First, people thought of the brain like a piece of paper. Then they thought of it like a book. Now, many people think of it like a computer. However, these ideas are not perfect and can lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation comes into the brain from our senses. Our senses are our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. They turn things like touch, heat, sound, and light into signals. The brain changes these signals many times. This helps us understand what we see and hear.\n\nThere are two ways the brain changes these signals. One way is from small pieces of information to bigger pieces. The other way is from using what we know to help us understand things faster. For example, if you see a picture of a box, the brain first puts together small pieces of information like color and shape. Then, it uses what we know to decide that it is a box.\n\nThe brain also decides which signals are important and which ones we should pay attention to. For example, when you look at your shoes, your brain doesn't notice every single blade of grass. But if someone says your name, you might hear it even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain has different ways to store information. There are three types: sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain must put the information into a form it can understand. There are different ways to do this, like looking at what a word looks like, hearing how it sounds, or knowing what it means.\n\nOnce the information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies with animals show that working memory, which lasts about 20 seconds, is like a signal in a special group of brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the shape of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to think about how the brain stores and uses information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others come from computer science, and others come from studying the brain. One idea is that the brain uses nodes, like links in a chain, to connect related ideas. For example, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley wrote a book called Brave New World. It is a story about a bad future where people are controlled by a person called the World Controller. The people in this story do not value the individual. They value the community above all else. They are taught to be happy from a young age. But they are not really free. They are like pawns in a game.\n\nHuxley was afraid of a future where people are controlled by technology and money. He showed this in his story. The people in the story are not allowed to think for themselves. They do what they are told. They are not allowed to love or feel strong emotions. They just want to be happy and not be unhappy.\n\nHuxley used ideas from Marxism in his story. In Marxism, people who are poor and work hard are kept down by people who are rich and powerful. In Brave New World, the poor people are kept down by the World Controller and the rich people who are born with special bodies and brains. They call these people Alphas and Betas. They are in charge and the others have to do what they are told.\n\nThe people in the story do not know that they are being controlled. They just want to be happy and have fun. They do not know about the people who are in charge and how they are being controlled. Huxley showed this in his story. He made it seem like the people in the story are happy, but really they are not free.\n\nThe people in the story do not have relationships with each other. They just interact with each other in a shallow way. They do not love each other or feel deep emotions. They are just like machines. Huxley was showing how people can become like machines if they are controlled by technology and money.\n\nHuxley was warning people about the dangers of a future where people are controlled by technology and money. He showed how people can become like machines and lose their free will. He showed how people can be kept down by those in power and not know it.",
            "I have been a student here at University Park for two and a half years. Traveling on campus can be hard for many students, including me. My first year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room. It was far from the center of campus. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building, near the center, could take 25 minutes on foot. The weather in State College is often bad.\n\nI talked to an old student. He said that not long ago, East Halls was far from the rest of campus. Now, there are many new buildings and apartments. As the campus grows, getting from one place to another gets harder. The best way to solve mobility problems on campus is with a bike. But bikes alone are not enough. Students must ride them, and the campus must be made for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rode a bike again after a few years. He said, “Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.” Besides being good for your body, biking is the most efficient way to travel. I live off campus, not near the center of campus. Last year, I bought a bike. It was a smart decision. I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home. If I ride my bike fast, it only takes 5 minutes. However, Pollock Road is not easy to ride on. I like biking because I am too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would take too much time. Every week, it would be over two and a half hours. I don’t have time for that."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to work in social work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are hurt or neglected and support families who are having problems. Important values for me in social work are: helping others, respecting people, being honest, and improving my skills to be a good worker. These values are important for social workers and also for me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. In high school and college, I saw people who were unhappy but did not know how to help themselves. I decided to study psychology in college. After I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I was not sure what job to do. But one day, I met a teenager who was being hurt by his parents. I wanted to help him, so I went to the police and told them what I knew. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I talked to them, they were not honest about what was happening to the teenager. This made me decide to work in social work to help children who are being hurt by their families.\n\nAnother important value for me is fair treatment for everyone. We say that every person is important, but sometimes we do not act that way. I believe in being different and not following what others do. In school, I fought for what I believed in, like being against unfairness and racism. I will continue to stand up for what is right.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems called insomnia. The first way is biological. It looks at what the body does and what happens when it is not working right. This includes things like genes and the body's health. The second way is sociocultural. It looks at how the world around us affects our sleep. This includes things like culture, race, and our economic situation.\n\nInsomnia can be caused by different things. It can be a primary problem, a problem that is connected to another mental health issue, or a problem caused by a medical condition or something we put into our body.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at how our bodies work. Our genes and brain cells help us sleep and stay awake. A study on mice found that special receptors in the brain help us sleep and wake up. If these receptors are not working right, we can have trouble sleeping. A medicine that helps these receptors work better made the mice sleep longer.\n\nThis study shows that our genes and the world around us can affect our sleep. If we are born with a problem with these receptors, we may have trouble sleeping. This can affect our daily life and make it hard to focus and do things.\n\nThe sociocultural model of sleep problems looks at how the world around us affects our sleep. This includes things like our family, friends, and where we live. Insomnia can be caused by different things like our culture, our economic situation, and our age.\n\nFor example, a study found that people in some cultures sleep less than people in other cultures. This can be because of the way they live or the things they do. A person's economic situation can also affect their sleep. If they do not have a good place to live or are worried about money, they may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe strengths of these studies are that they help us understand why people have insomnia and how to treat it. However, they also have weaknesses. They do not always explain why people have insomnia and they do not always work for everyone.",
            "**Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)**\n\n**What is CAPD?**\n\nCAPD is a disorder that affects how the brain uses sound information. It is not the same as hearing loss. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding and processing them. This can make it hard to understand speech, especially in noisy places.\n\n**History of CAPD**\n\nThe idea of CAPD started in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. In 1954, a team of researchers began creating tests for these children. In 1961, another researcher created a test to check how the brain processes sound. A big meeting in 1977 helped researchers learn more about CAPD.\n\n**How CAPD Affects People**\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. Some people with CAPD:\n\n- Have trouble finding the source of a sound\n- Have trouble telling two or more sounds apart\n- Have trouble recognizing patterns in sounds\n- Have trouble understanding changes in speech\n- Have trouble hearing one sound when another sound comes after it\n- Have trouble putting together sound clues\n- Have trouble understanding the order of sounds\n\n**Diagnosing CAPD**\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a professional must watch how a person behaves when listening and give them tests to check their listening abilities. These tests can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no one test that can diagnose CAPD for sure, and we do not know what causes it.\n\n**Helping Students with CAPD in the Classroom**\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in many ways. They can:\n\n- Give students extra time to understand instructions\n- Use visual aids to help them understand\n- Minimize background noise in the classroom\n- Encourage students to ask for help when they do not understand\n- Use simple language and repeat instructions\n- Provide extra help when needed",
            "The play Twelfth Night talks about a big problem. The play says that using a disguise can be helpful when you want to trick people. But it can also cause big problems. If you stay with the disguise too long, you can lose your real self.\n\nOne problem with stopping a trick is that you may hurt people who trusted you. They might not forgive you. Some people will not be angry, but others will be very upset.\n\nThe play talks about people who change their gender. This is called gender role reversal. This is a big problem because it makes people ask questions. Why do people change their gender? Why do they want to hide who they really are?\n\nIn the play, a woman named Viola wants to be a man. She wants to protect herself. She feels safe when she is a man. Viola's plan works, but it puts her in a hard situation. She is alone and cannot talk to the women she knows. She is also in love with a man, and he is in love with her, but he thinks she is a man.\n\nThe play also shows that sometimes people hide their feelings. They do not say what they really want. In the play, a woman named Olivia falls in love with Viola, but she thinks Viola is a man. This makes Olivia's feelings confusing. It shows that people can have secret feelings that they do not talk about.\n\nThe play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful, but it can also cause big problems. People may lose their real selves or hurt the people they love. The play also talks about people hiding their feelings. It shows that people can have secret feelings that they do not talk about.",
            "The German colonial rule in Africa was known for being very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. It was different in different places. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. The German government had done a good job in educating them. But in South West Africa, the situation was very different.\n\nMost Africans in South West Africa were not educated. They could not read or write. The government did not help much with education. Instead, missionary groups tried to educate the Africans. The government gave them some money, but not much. They also helped European students a lot. They built schools for them and controlled the schools that the missionaries ran. This made a big difference in South West Africa. Other German colonies had many educated Africans, but South West Africa did not.\n\nWhy was South West Africa so different? There were many reasons. We want to find out what these reasons were. We also want to look at how the people who lived in the colonies and the government thought about the Africans. There is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some people have written about the differences in education in the different colonies. One important study is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was one reason why education was different there.\n\nSouth West Africa was a relatively nice place to live. It was not too hot and not too cold. Many Europeans moved there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. This was a lot more than in other colonies.",
            "Music called Popular Music has grown a lot over 100 years. It now includes many kinds. It is hard to make a list of all kinds. Many kinds of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, have smaller kinds. Heavy Metal rock is a popular kind of music now. It is special because it shows a wide range of feelings. It often shows darker feelings. Many people started their own kind of Heavy Metal music. This made many smaller kinds of music. This chain of kinds continues today.\n\nHeavy metal music today is hard to understand. It has many different kinds of music. It has taken ideas from other kinds of music. But it started from something. To understand heavy metal music now, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy Metal music is often dark. It is often loud and wild. It is often about strong feelings. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at their instruments. This is clear in the music. Heavy Metal music also started with people taking drugs. There was a big time when people took drugs in the 1970s. This led to people making strange and crazy music. They used the drugs as an excuse for their music. Heavy Metal music has many dark qualities. This was new in popular music. Later, younger Heavy Metal groups took ideas from the past. They made music with dark and wild ideas. Some examples of this are in the song \"Helter Skelter\". This song shows the dark side of the Beatles. It is like a rollercoaster with ups and downs. Some people think this is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles wrote it as a challenge to another group, the Rolling Stones. They wanted to show they could make loud and dark music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous French painter. He made his paintings in a style called Post-Impressionism. His painting called \"The Dream\" shows a woman looking at a beautiful place in her dreams. This painting is also about Rousseau's own dreams and wishes.\n\nRousseau wanted many things in his life. He wanted other artists and people to accept and like his paintings. He wanted recognition and praise for his work. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he was not sure how to do it.\n\nTo understand \"The Dream\" better, we need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. Rousseau did not go to art school. He worked for the government in France for forty years. When his wife and eight children died, he was left with only one daughter. He was very sad. He started painting to feel better and to start a new life.\n\nRousseau was a folk painter. He painted about everyday people and things. He was like an average person, not a king or a rich person. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but it was very hard. Many other artists were famous and good. Rousseau started painting late in his life. He did not get famous until a man named Matisse became a famous artist.\n\nThe book Modern French Painters says that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Matisse did not want to make boring paintings. Rousseau wanted to make paintings that were so good that people would accept him as a real artist.",
            "Many people think that ethics and art are connected. They believe that truth and beauty are the same thing. A famous writer, John Keats, said this in a poem. He said that beauty and truth are the same thing, and that is all we need to know about them.\n\nWe learn many things in life through education and experience. But we know that ethics and art are special. They are not like things we learn in school. We appreciate them without being taught. Ethics and art are like descriptions of something, not rules to follow.\n\nWhen we talk about art or ethics, we try to explain what makes something good or beautiful. But we cannot fully explain it. We can talk about the colors, shapes, and textures of a painting. But in the end, that does not tell us why it is good art. When we talk about our favorite art or literature, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This is hard to explain.\n\nI think that ethics and art are similar in this way. No matter how well we describe something, there is something more that we cannot explain. A woman writer, Flannery O'Connor, said that stories are like this too. She said that stories are a way to say something that cannot be said in words.\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because they are both about something we feel deeply. They are not just things we learn in school. They are things we experience, but cannot fully explain. This is why we find ethics and art so important.\n\nA writer, McKean, said that literature is unique because it has a moral quality. Literature is about values. It is about what is right and wrong. We find values in literature and in life. We like literature because it helps us understand what is important.",
            "Germany is a strong country. It is a united place with a special culture. This culture is felt from the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It is also felt in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nThis unique culture comes from many different groups and tribes. Germany has a long history. People have lived there for a long time.\n\nThe place called Germania is the home of the Germans. But where did the name Germania come from? Many scholars and historians do not agree. One historian said the name came from a group of people called the Tungrians. They were a Germanic tribe that lived on the other side of the Rhine River.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book. He used the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about the wars with the Gauls. He took this word from the Gauls themselves. Caesar used it to show the difference between the Gauls and the Germans.\n\nSome people think the name Germania came from a spear that the Germans used in battles. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This might mean the Germans were loud. \n\nA historian named Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He said the Germans were the original people of the area. They did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild country with bad weather and tough people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germania. They would go there to get goods and to fight battles. They would then go back to their big empire. The Germanic tribes lived on the border of the Roman Empire. They would trade with the Romans and fight for them.",
            "I stood still, looking at the picture in front of me. My mind was not working well. I did not understand the scene. It was like looking at something new and strange. Ideas came into my mind, but they went away quickly. My mind was like a calm and clear stream, but it had no thoughts. \n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw. When I was six years old, I started to think about it. I found a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people how to draw. The book says to put a square around a picture to make it easier to understand. This helps us see the main things in the picture. I tried to do this, but I could not. The picture in front of me was too complicated. I was too surprised and amazed. I just stood and looked at it. \n\nArtists have different styles. Picasso used blue, Monet liked green and yellow. The old Italian artists used many colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, I had to start by looking at this picture. This could be the start of my art. I called it \"Work in Brown.\" I picked up a pencil and started to draw. My hand moved smoothly over the paper. I was in a good place, creating something new. But then my hand jerked and went to the toilet handle. I had to clean up a mess. Someone had left a big, brown pile of waste in the toilet. I used a mop to clean it up. I was not happy about it. I wore a green tie and my feet were apart. I stared at the mess and thought about it. I made my hand into a glove to protect it from the mess. Then I put my hand into the toilet and cleaned it up.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several factors cause this problem. The brain of a teenager is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teenagers do not have enough experience. This lack of experience causes many more accidents and makes them drive too fast, drive off the road, or turn over their cars. Teenagers also drive worse when their friends are with them.\n\nA study in California found that how old the passenger is and how many traffic accidents happen are connected. To make driving safer for teenagers, some states give them temporary licenses that limit how many hours they can drive and do not allow them to drive with other minors.\n\nBut these temporary licenses are not a long-term solution. The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young for a driver's license. He did research that shows many young people want to take risks and do exciting things. This means that teenagers should not drive until they are a little older and are less likely to take risks. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more people will be killed in car accidents.\n\nA simple law could solve this problem. Schools could teach driver's education classes to help teenagers learn how to drive. No one under 18 could drive a car. Before getting a full driver's license, teenagers could get a temporary permit and practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours could be the same as in most states. Because many states have similar problems, a national law would be a good way to make driving safer for teenagers.\n\nThis idea is not new. Many states have already tried it. It would work and save many lives.",
            "I looked at movies from the early days of film at the Library of Congress. I wanted to watch all the trick films. These films were made between eighteen ninety-five and nineteen hundred one. There were fifteen of them. Trick films use editing to create illusions. My study of film looked at how trick films use creative editing to make people believe what they see. I also looked at how some films from the end of the nineteenth century began to break the rules of film-making.\n\nOne thing that many trick films have in common is that they were made in a studio with a stage in the front. The camera does not move from this position to follow people or objects. This style of making films came from the theatre and magic shows. Because of this style, people in the films usually do not move towards or away from the camera. In the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" actors enter from one side and move back and forth. They stay in the same place. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame.\n\nMost trick films use long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are not used in these films. This is because in theatre and magic shows, the audience sees the entire performance at one time. In early films, actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are not possible.\n\nMost trick films are short, about one minute or less. They focus on simple tricks, like magic or disappearing acts. But sometimes, one conceptual shot in a film can be made up of several physical shots. For example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" is part of a single conceptual shot.",
            "John Taylor was a well-known American. He liked farming. He was a strong supporter of the Republican party. Taylor was for personal freedom and against a big government. He believed that farming was the best kind of work. His ideas about farming helped form his opinions on government. He thought the government should not interfere with people's lives.\n\nTaylor believed America had a great chance to make a perfect government. The country was new, so there were no old ideas to get in the way. He believed people have natural rights. These rights are important and should be protected. If one person's rights are taken, all people's rights are at risk.\n\nTaylor said that in the wild, strong people and mean people do well. But in a society, this should not be true. He believed a good government should understand that people are good and bad. He thought good principles are important for a government. Good principles protect private property and help farmers. They also make sure people do not take advantage of others. A good government will work well even if its leaders are not perfect. Leaders are often led by selfishness.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is strict and follows the Constitution. He did not want a big government with many powers. He thought a big government is expensive and can be evil. But he also believed that a simple reading of the Constitution can be bad if it does not consider the writers' intentions. Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence is the real charter of the United States. It says the country is a group of separate states, not one country.",
            "A look at the numbers shows a big drop in people using the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a little disappointing. It is not easy to say why this happened.\n\nWinter was coming to the school. Many people were riding bicycles or walking less. This might explain some of the drop. December is a busy time for students and teachers. They are finishing their work and preparing for grades. They might forget to use the commuter log. In December, people also start thinking about holidays. This means many students and teachers do not need to come to school for a month. Classes start again in late January. This might also be the reason for the low numbers. But we still do not know why the numbers were low in February.\n\nOne idea is that all projects have a lot of energy at the start. Then the energy goes down. We tried to fix this by creating a special week to use the log more, called Carpool Challenge Week in March. This worked and more people used the log in March.\n\nAnother problem we faced was that people like to drive cars. It is a part of our culture. We need to give people good reasons to use other ways to get to school. We gave prizes like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and a bookstore. It would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bicycle or a new car. This might have stopped the decline in participation.\n\nThe prizes we gave out did not change much. If we had increased the prizes as the project went on, this might have helped. The gift cards were good at first, but adding bigger prizes in December and January might have made people want to use the log more.",
            "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a kind of investment. It follows an index, a group of stocks, or a basket of assets. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on the stock market. An ETF gives you the benefits of owning many stocks together and the freedom to make decisions like buying or selling quickly. It also has lower costs than many other kinds of investments.\n\nThe benefits of ETFs are attractive. But there are some downsides. You have to pay a fee for each trade, like you would for buying or selling a stock. There are also many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nThis text will look at one ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up most of the ETF. We want to know if owning the ETF is like owning the top 10 stocks combined. We also want to see if there are better ways to combine these stocks for better results.\n\nTo make our report easier to read, we will only look at the top 10 stocks. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 stocks and how much they make up of the entire ETF.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the whole ETF, we will use a chart. The chart shows how much each stock contributes to the ETF's performance. We will also see how much each stock contributes to the ETF's risk.\n\nOur chart shows that a portfolio of only the top 10 stocks would earn 6.11% more than the ETF. It would also be less sensitive to market movements. This means that the top 10 stocks might be a good choice for some investors. But we need to be sure that these results are not just a coincidence.\n\nTo do this, we will look at the standard deviation of each stock. Standard deviation shows us how much a stock can move up or down in value. We will compare the standard deviation of the top 10 stocks to the standard deviation of the ETF IHF. This will help us know if owning the ETF or the top 10 stocks is the better choice.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land\". It is one of his best works. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 of the poem. This word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil. Virgil used it to name a island north of Britain, which the Greeks thought was the edge of the world.\n\nBut Poe was also influenced by another writer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It tells a story about a king who loses his wife and drinks too much, remembering her. The king then decides to die.\n\nPoe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is similar to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\". They both describe a sad and lonely place called Thulé. The place is dark and without color. The speaker in Poe's poem is haunted by dead friends. This is like the king in Goethe's poem, who is lonely and sad after losing his wife.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe probably knew about. Poe admired a writer named Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and it is likely Poe was also familiar with Goethe's work. Many copies of Goethe's books were made after its first publication. Poe was interested in German writers, and Goethe was one of the most famous German writers of his time.\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in his writings. Once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as the beginning and ending of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together as two related poems. They both describe a sad and lonely place.",
            "In California law, can a customer hurt in a store get extra money as punishment? This customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell in a store after an applesauce spill. She was hurt badly. She thinks the store manager, Paul Martin, was mean on purpose because he knew about the spill twice and did not clean it for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner. Can she prove this in court?\n\nA judge will not throw out Palmer's claim for extra money right away. To get extra money, Palmer must show that Martin was very aware of the harm he could cause and was very careless. She can tell the judge that Martin knew many people were hurt in the store before she fell. He knew this because many people slipped and fell in the store in the past months. But Martin still did nothing to make the store safe. Palmer will argue that Martin was very bad because he did not clean up the spill. But it is not clear how bad he was.\n\nHere are the facts of the case. On October 13, 2009, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, told Martin about the spill. He said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. Before that, five people slipped and fell in the store in 2009.\n\nPalmer is suing D&D Markets for money because of her injury. Now, we are thinking about asking the judge to throw out part of her claim for extra money. In California, a person can get extra money if the other person was very mean or did something wrong on purpose. This means the other person must have meant to cause harm, or they must have done something very bad and very careless.\n\nTo prove that Martin was very mean, Palmer must show that he was aware of the harm he could cause and still did nothing to stop it. The law says that if a person is very aware of the harm they can cause and still does not stop it, that is very bad. In a past case, a court said that this kind of behavior is very mean.\n\nWe are trying to decide if Palmer can prove that Martin was very mean. We will see if she can show that he knew about the harm he could cause and still did nothing to stop it.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC four years ago. There was a big discussion in class about whether Islam is a hostile religion. I still think this question is very important today. Many events since the September 11 attacks have shown me that the media's view of Islam has changed. It used to be very negative, but now it is very positive.\n\nI think it is interesting to read the biography of the Prophet Muhammad. What I have learned about Muhammad's history does not match the picture of him in the biography. I used to think that Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would conquer and take control of tribes, and then make them become Muslims. But the biography writes about Muhammad as a kind and humble person. More and more people were attracted to his teachings because they saw his kindness and truth.\n\nThere are some strange similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad. One example is when Muhammad took a little food and made it enough for many people. The way this story is written makes me think that the authors wanted Muhammad to seem like a kind and humble prophet who did not need to prove anything. This makes me think that they are taking away from the miracles and teachings of Jesus. It is like they are trying to take credit for Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nI also have a problem with the stories in the biography. Many of the stories are not from the people who actually saw these things happen. They are told to us by someone who heard it from someone else. This makes me think that the stories are not true.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is that the biography shows Muhammad as a very kind and humble person. But history tells us that this is not true. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A long time ago, Jesus taught us many things. But his teachings were soon left behind. People continued to think about Jesus and his ideas in different ways. If we look at history, we see a big change. The ideas that Jesus taught are no longer the same as what people believe today.\n\nMost people believe in one God. This idea started with the Jewish people. The Jewish people were a group divided into many parts. They had different ideas about how to live their lives.\n\nThe Jewish people had many different groups. The Sadducees were one group. The Pharisees were another. The Essenes and the Zealots were groups too. Most people were just common people.\n\nThe Roman Empire took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not the same. They had many different ideas.\n\nToday, we see that many people are thinking about Jesus' ideas again. They want to go back to what he originally taught. This will take time. It may take many years or even many centuries. But it will happen. People will start to remove extra ideas that were added to Christianity. They will go back to what Jesus taught.\n\nWhen this starts to happen, people will begin to believe the same things again. They will no longer have many different ideas. This will happen in the United States and Europe. It will happen in all the Christian groups.\n\nThis is not a new thing. It has happened before. Many years ago, the Roman Empire was against the Christians. But later, the Roman Empire became a Christian group. Our country has changed many times. We used to treat African-Americans as slaves. Now we have African-American leaders.\n\nThe same thing will happen in the Christian religion. It will go back to what Jesus taught. To understand what Jesus said, people will read his words as symbols, not as exact statements.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus lived? If we go far back in time, we see only Judaism. This was the base of the Christian religion. The Jewish people believed in one God. They believed that God gave them special messages. And they believed in the Jewish scriptures.",
            "I think the book \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally selfish. They want to live good lives, but they do not think about others. This is shown many times in the book. The owners and managers of factories want to make their companies big and strong. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care about pollution or hurting animals and people.\n\nAccording to the book, the factories are very dirty. The smoke they make goes up into the air and hurts people. The owners do not care about this. They also do not care about the animals that live nearby. They do not care about the people who work for them. The owners want to get rich and will do anything to do it. They make their workers work too much and then they lay them off without giving them any help. The workers have no protection and are treated very badly.\n\nThe workers were like slaves. They were very poor and had no way to escape their bad situation. They were dependent on the factory owners who were very mean and did not care about them. This made a lot of problems in the community.\n\nThe book says that this is like slavery. The workers were treated very badly and had no rights. This made it hard for them to live a good life. The book shows that people need to be kind and think about others, not just themselves.",
            "Many writers use special techniques to make readers feel a certain way about important ideas. These techniques can be very effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example, uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs a word with its meaning that is not usually together to give readers a certain feeling. He also uses symbols to represent ideas and uses them again later to give readers a reminder of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses many colors in a special way. He gives meanings to colors like white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning of white and gray, and then uses it to describe important things.\n\nFitzgerald says white is better and more nice, and gray is older and less nice. He uses these words a lot in the beginning of the book. Many people wear white clothes: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white pants, and Tom wears a white shirt. The only time people do not wear white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party. The party is colorful and bright.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. He says some people and places are white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had a happy white childhood together, but later, Daisy is just a white car and a white dress, showing she is not a special person.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show readers that some people are not important. He uses these colors to describe Daisy in a way that makes her seem like just a normal thing. For example, he describes her wearing a white dress and a gray fur collar. He uses white and gray to show readers that Daisy is not a special character.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with other colors too. He gives meanings to red and pink and uses them to describe important things. He wants readers to feel a certain way about these colors and things.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The climate is warm and sunny. Farmers grow many things here. They grow tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. Many people want to buy food from local farms. There is a big market for organic food in San Diego. This means people want food grown without chemicals. They want organic eggs and milk too. Some farms give tours and let people visit their land. They can walk, watch birds, and have fun.\n\nThis kind of farm is good for the land and for people. The government gives money to farmers who take care of the land. They can also have people visit their farm and learn about farming. But organic farming is harder than other kinds of farming. It needs more work to get rid of bugs and weeds. Farmers need to use natural ways to make the soil good. This can be expensive. It is also harder to make money than with big farms. Small farms need more help to be profitable.\n\nA farm in San Diego County is a good place to talk about this. The farm is near a town called Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The land is near a forest. Many animals live here. Some are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are getting less common and might be in danger soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. First, Native Americans lived here. Then, in the late 1800s, cattle ranchers and people who sold wood came. The land was used for grazing and making wood.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a farm in the area. I looked at government programs to see how a small farmer can save money and help the animals. I used a real farm as an example of what someone might do.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any kind of negotiation. Culture is not the same thing everywhere and is not a single thing. We cannot say all people from one country are the same. Understanding a culture is harder than making a general statement about it. It is more useful for a negotiator to know how a culture affects a negotiation and how its values can help or hurt the talks.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. We make judgments based on what we know. But it is better to accept a culture as it is and work within its rules. This is especially true when you are in a weaker position in a negotiation. If you are in a different place and country, showing respect for their traditions and values can help you have a successful negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. This can be seen in how they dress, how they talk, and who they hire. Some companies work long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. Some people work together and help each other, while others work alone.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because it helps us know why people do things. If a culture values saving face, a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or boss. If a culture values making a good deal, a negotiator will not give up easily. Knowing these things can help you have a successful negotiation.\n\nBefore you start negotiating, it is a good idea to learn a little about the other person. This can help you make a good deal. Knowing about the other person's values and culture can help you be a good negotiator.",
            "People say, \"There is no God.\" This is from the Bible in Psalm 14. A man named St. Anselm used this idea. Another man, Thomas Aquinas, also believed in God. Both men wrote about why God exists. We want to know who is right.\n\nWe will start by saying we think they are both right. This way, we can compare their ideas about God. If we allow them to believe in a different kind of God, it's hard to compare their arguments.\n\nSt. Anselm said people can find God in their own minds. He said we cannot think about God not being real. This means God exists because we can think about him. We don't need to look outside ourselves for proof. This idea is called faith. It means believing something is true, even if we can't show it to others.\n\nThomas Aquinas said people can use reason and evidence to know God exists. He didn't need faith. He used five arguments to prove God's existence: change, cause, chance, order, and harmony. He said we can know God exists by thinking about these things.\n\nFor example, if you're given a puzzle with all the pieces except one, you can still know what the missing piece looks like. You don't need to see it to know it exists.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince named Siddhartha was born. He would one day be called the Buddha, which means the leader who has found truth. Before he was the Buddha, he renounced the world and became very wise. His teachings created the religion of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is now about two and a half thousand years old. It looks different from when the Buddha was alive. In the country of Sri Lanka, people celebrate an annual ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is important for the people who follow Theravada Buddhism, a main part of Buddhism.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas about the religion over time. This is because of forces inside the community and from outside. Some forces are good for Buddhism, and some are bad.\n\nSome words are used many times in this discussion. These words are internal, external, hostile, and benign. Internal means something comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something comes from outside the group. Hostile means something is bad for Buddhism. Benign means something is not bad for Buddhism.\n\nLet's learn about the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha's teachings are in three groups of text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the important talks of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and the universe.\n\nBuddhists believe in some important ideas. These ideas are that there is no permanent soul, that life has suffering, and that everything changes. These ideas help people escape the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. When people become enlightened, they will no longer have desire, hatred, and delusion.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Laymen have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take what is not given, do not have sex with someone who is not your partner, and do not take drugs. Monks have many more rules.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "A long time ago, the United States and Mexico were enemies for 57 years. This started in 1836 and ended in 1893. The biggest problem between them happened during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and took over some land from Mexico. This included Texas and the southwest part of the United States.\n\nMany small fights happened between the two countries. But they stopped just before World War I. The reason for the long fight was that Americans and Mexicans had different ideas about religion, culture and tradition. They also had different interests.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have problems. They have different interests and ideas, which can cause disagreements. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have long-standing problems with their neighbors.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher said, \"The United States has long-standing problems with Mexico and Cuba\" (p. 41). Both of these countries are close to the United States and have been enemies. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nA problem between the United States and Mexico was about religion. Many years ago, Americans were against Catholicism and monarchies. This was also true during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union were enemies. But this time, the problem was about the two countries' different religious ideas.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not trust each other because of the way the English and Spanish treated them in the past. This made it hard for them to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts listed 17 problems between the United States and Mexico during the 57-year fight. Most of these problems were about land and border issues. There were many fights between bandits and outlaws from one side of the border to the other. But when the United States and Mexico used force to control their borders, the problem started to go away.\n\nSchmitt said the problem started to go away when Mexico needed the United States for help (p. 109). The United States also changed its goals from getting more land to helping Mexico economically (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with a disease I did not know I had.\n\nI was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. I did not have those things when I was a child. My friends told me, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\"\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing. I am now 46 years old and single. I have no money. I am unable to work. To this day, I am sick. I get money from the government because I am unable to work. But after 15 years, I have nothing.\n\nI struggle every day to stay safe and happy. But I know one thing is true. I would not have made it without the help of my family and friends. They were strong and helped me when I was weak.\n\nMy point is this: bad things will happen in life. There are no guarantees. We must work together to help each other.\n\nI agree we should not rely too much on the government. But I think we should trust and help each other. This is how our country was built. Our ancestors helped each other and shared what they had.\n\nThey did not cross the country alone. They helped each other and worked together.\n\nSo, be prepared. I am prepared.

            "The question is: Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that control how they change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now, zoologists do not know how to describe simple forms in math.\" This is still true today. Recently, scientists used math to study how mollusks grow their skeletons.\n\nOur study is trying to figure out how to use math and experiments to learn about how living things change over time. We are studying a group of animals called Prunum. We used special pictures of their skeletons to create math formulas. These formulas can help us understand how their skeletons changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space as the animal grows. The shell has many turns, called whorls. Each whorl is like a spiral that grows around a center line. The speed at which the whorls grow can be different. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The other whorls are called the spire. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. When we see the opening of the shell, it is called an apertural view. When we see the top of the shell, it is called an apical view.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top and draw a line where the first suture starts. We can then count the whorls from that line. We can also use math to draw a path of the shell's growth.\n\nThis path can be represented mathematically and graphically. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how the mollusk's skeleton grows.",
            "Indonesia's rate of baby and child deaths has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in some areas, but not enough to meet its goals for child and mother health by 2015.  There are many reasons for this problem.  These reasons will be discussed below.  They show that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger, not just improve programs for specific health problems.\n\nIndonesia is doing better in getting skilled health workers to deliver babies.  Now, 72% of births have a skilled worker present.  But this number includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there are problems during delivery.  So, improvements in this area are not as good as they seem.  In addition, fewer children under five with diarrhea are being treated by health professionals. Data on taking care of new mothers is also incomplete, but it shows that this is a big problem.\n\nToo few babies are delivered by C-section.  This is 4% of all births.  This number shows another problem.  In cities, 7% of babies are delivered by C-section.  But in the countryside, it is only 2%.  This means that healthcare is not available equally across the country.  People in cities are getting better healthcare than people in the countryside.\n\nAnother problem is that wealthy people are getting better healthcare than poor people.  There is a 27% gap in how often people use healthcare services, depending on how much money they have.  Poor people are not using healthcare services because they cannot afford it.\n\nSo, the question is how to improve healthcare for babies and mothers.  Should Indonesia make a plan to solve a specific problem, or should it make the healthcare system stronger?  Some people think that solving a specific problem is a good idea.  This approach has specific goals and can show fast results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  If Indonesia spends a lot of money on one health problem, it may not have enough money for other health problems.  Also, there may be too many programs doing the same thing, and they may not be working together.",
            "Two kinds of books are called Victorian novels. They are classics from a long time ago. These books are about the rich people of the time. But two books, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They have many strange and mysterious parts. These parts make the characters in the books more interesting. They help readers understand what the characters think and feel.\n\nIn one book, Oliver Twist, a boy named Oliver has many strange dreams. These dreams show what is inside Oliver's heart. They show his pain and what he knows about the world around him. In another part of the book, Oliver remembers a shooting. He relives the shooting in his mind, like he is dreaming. This shows how scared and helpless Oliver is. He had no control over what happened to him. He was forced to suffer pain and fear. This makes the reader think that Oliver feels like giving up. He has no power over what happens to him.\n\nAnother book, Wuthering Heights, is also a mystery. It has a strange and scary atmosphere. Time is not clear in this book. It is like day and night are mixed up. The days are very long, but they are also very short. The nights are very quiet, but they are also very brief.\n\nThese two books show that sometimes bad things happen to people. They have no control over these things. These books help readers understand how people feel when they are suffering.",
            "I worked with young students in an after-school program. They were in elementary school. I helped them with many subjects, but I was best with English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. He could say some words correctly, but others not. It was strange. He was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. I worked with him, but we had problems. Then I met his mother. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, but it was not very good. We talked a little bit. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet very well. I am not sure if this helped him, but I hope he is better now.\n\nI tell this story because many students have trouble with languages in school, especially in California. It is not always easy for students who speak English well to read. I think everyone knows this is a problem. What can we do? In Adrian's case, he needed help with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for students who do not speak English very well, the solution is more complicated. There is no one answer. We need a combination of things. These are the dual language system, mainstream classes, private tutors, ESL classes. None of these things will fix the problem by itself.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It is not just for students who speak Spanish. All students can benefit. Studies show that students in bilingual education programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all students will benefit. But how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages.",
            "We are told from a young age that there is something bigger than us in the world. Some people go to church or temple to learn about it. Others look inside themselves for answers. Many follow the same religion as their parents, but some people do not believe.\n\nWe search for our own path in life. We try to understand what is important to us. This is called our spirituality. We look for a way to guide us through life.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our front porch. It was raining. The sound of the rain on the roof was loud. My father looked out at the rain. He seemed sad. He was not eating much and was losing his hair. He looked thin.\n\nI wanted to talk to him about how I would miss him when he was gone. But I was afraid. Talking about it would make it more real. So I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out at the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December when I was twenty-two years old. He was sick for a long time. The doctors said he would not get better. But he lived a little longer because of medicine. I did not want to watch him die.

No one called me to ask how I was doing.",
            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is called an oxymoron, which means two things that do not go together. Ian Watt says this in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. \n\nIn the past, people did not like the Gothic novel. They said it had no real depth. But some people praised it for its spooky and exciting parts. The first Gothic novel was The Castle of Otranto. It was written by Horace Walpole. He used old and new ideas to create a new way of writing.\n\nWalpole used old theatrical ideas and new ideas from modern novels. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic novel uses many old ideas from medieval times. These ideas come from theater, buildings, and customs. People thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned when The Castle of Otranto was published. They thought it was not as good as modern ideas.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas makes the Gothic novel special. It is why the Gothic novel was popular for a long time and remains interesting even today. \n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a code of honor for knights. It was used in medieval times. The idea of chivalry is used in The Castle of Otranto. It is important because it represents what a good knight should be: brave, honest, and skilled. \n\nGothic writers used the idea of chivalry to say that the world had lost its good values. They wanted to remind people of the good old days. The writer of The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole, wrote during a time of political trouble. He was unhappy with the way society was. He thought that people had lost their good qualities. This idea is seen in his character, Frederic. He is a prince, a leader, and he has been through hard times. He is described as a gallant and courteous knight. This is an exaggeration, but it shows how the idea of chivalry was important in the Gothic novel.",
            "Supply chain management is the way goods move from the customer's order to the final product. This process includes moving goods from raw materials to the customer. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described the steps to follow to plan, implement, and control the supply chain to make customers happy quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base of the supply chain. Production decides how and when goods will be made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to understand customer needs. The market shows what customers want.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what goods to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make these goods. They choose a place that is good for making things in large amounts and with high quality, keeping customer needs in mind.\n\nAfter deciding where to make goods, managers focus on planning workloads and taking care of equipment. Production is a very important part of the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned well, it can cost the company time and money.\n\nFor example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of their business. They have a design for employee uniforms and a plan for receiving shipments from trucks. Having plans helps companies work smoothly and without confusion.\n\nThe second key part of supply chain management is supply. Supply is about making good decisions about a company's strengths and partnerships. A company may have many parts that make different things. Managers decide which part is best for each job. They may also decide to work with other companies to make things. This is called outsourcing. Companies outsource to save time and money.\n\nThe manager's goal is to make things quickly and at a low cost. This is called velocity.",
            "Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner. She holds a piece of cardboard above her head with a sad message. The sign says: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. The government there is very bad. Many people do not like the government.\n\nIn 2007, people in Burma started protesting. They were very unhappy with their government. The protests were led by many Buddhist monks. They wore yellow robes. The people of Burma started to support the monks. At first, the government allowed the monks to gather but then the government became angry. The government used force against the monks. The military invaded monasteries and hurt many people. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese reporter named Kenji Nagai was killed in 2007. He was reporting on the protests. Many people were killed. But few people know the real number. Colonel Hla Win said more than 13 people were killed. He said the number is in thousands.\n\nThis is not new. Governments want to control people and stop them from speaking out. This has been happening for a long time. In ancient Rome, the leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor is considered a god. Our president, George W. Bush, met with a man named Ted Haggard. He is a leader of a group that wants to help the government.\n\nThere are many examples of bad things that have happened. In 1989, many people in China were unhappy with their government. They gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed. But some groups said it was 2,000-3,000 people. In Rwanda, many people were killed in the 1990s. The government helped to kill people because of their ethnic group. Hitler's government in Germany was very bad. They killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington's music is famous because of his long life and his ability to make great music. He kept composing and directing his orchestra for a long time. Ellington was a good pianist, but he was a better composer. He wrote many complex pieces that showed the special talents of each musician in his orchestra. These pieces were often very good for soloists, who could improvise freely. Ellington also wrote pieces with strong melodies that suited each musician's style. He was very good at creating a good sound for his orchestra as a whole, making each piece unique.\n\nIn many pieces, Ellington used the voice as a musical instrument. He did this to add color and texture to his music. One early example is Creole Love Call, a slow blues piece. This piece has six parts. Each part is different, but they all work well together. In the first part, the singer and the reeds play a call-and-response pattern, with the singer singing smoothly and then more loudly. In the second part, a trumpet plays a solo. In the third part, a clarinet plays a fast, high melody, and the piano plays a syncopated pattern. The fourth part is like the first part, but with more instruments. In the fifth part, the reeds play the call-and-response pattern, and the brass and rhythm sections play together in a special way. In the sixth part, the singer and the reeds play the call-and-response pattern again, but this time the singer sounds like a saxophone. The last part is a short tag with a vocal run and a strange ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice in his music is just one example of his style. His music often has a lot of different sounds and textures, which makes it very interesting. He was a good composer because he knew how to use the special talents of each musician in his orchestra. He also knew how to create good sounds for his orchestra as a whole.\n\nIn his next pieces, such as Hot and Bothered, Ellington used his skill at writing tight compositions and his ear for sound color. In this piece, a call-and-response pattern between a trumpet and a singer creates a rich and complementary sound. In another piece, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington used a trombone to introduce the melody. These are just a few examples of Ellington's great ability to make music.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling started when she was fourteen and getting older. It was still there three years later, at seventeen. She wanted something, but she didn't know what. She wanted a person, not a thing. But she didn't like any boys. Some boys tried to show her attention, but she didn't feel anything.\n\nShe thought about this a lot. She tried to figure out what was wrong. She thought of different ideas, but none made sense. So she continued living her life, thinking about her feelings.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were good people. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her. They wanted her to be independent and have her own ideas. Her personality was strong, and her parents were calm. This made her a happy person.\n\nBut today was not a peaceful day. She walked around the house looking for ideas. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. She quickly went to the room and saw her mother on the floor in pain. Her mother was saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her mother and put a hand on her to help. \"I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother said. The daughter helped her mother to the car.\n\nAt the hospital, she smelled strong cleaning smells and sickness. She was too worried about her mother to be scared. She carried her mother quickly and called for help. Doctors came and took her mother to be seen. The daughter sat and worried.\n\nHer mother fell off a step stool while trying to get something from a high cabinet.",
            "This study was to see if following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" helps prevent heart disease and stroke. The study looked at how a \"Mediterranean Diet Score\" relates to these problems. The Mediterranean Diet is a healthy eating plan that includes many plant foods, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains, and less saturated fat and animal products.\n\nPast studies showed that eating this way can help people live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke or stroke deaths. This new study wanted to find out more about the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old. These women were part of a big study of 121,700 nurses in 11 states in the US. The researchers counted how well each woman followed the Mediterranean Diet six times between 1984 and 2004. They used a food diary to ask the women about what they ate.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They also had a lower risk of death from heart disease or stroke. The women who ate this way were about 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThe researchers also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, and physical activity. They found that the women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely were less likely to have heart disease or stroke even after taking these factors into account.\n\nOverall, this study shows that following the Mediterranean Diet can help prevent heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "In the year two thousand seven, a big financial problem happened in the United States of America. Many people lost their jobs, the value of homes went down, and some very big companies went out of business. This problem is still happening today. We need to ask why this problem happened and how to stop it. \n\nThe financial problem was caused by bad choices made by leaders. They made banks and companies give loans to people who could not pay them back. These loans were given to people who did not have enough money. When these people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money to pay back the people who had given them the money. This made a big problem for the banks and the whole economy.\n\nA long time before this happened, in the year nineteen ninety-nine, the President of the United States wanted to stay in office for a second time. To do this, he made rules that made it easier for people to get loans. This made it more likely that people would not be able to pay back their loans. A man named Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote about this in nineteen ninety-nine. He said the company that makes many of the loans for homes, called Fannie Mae, was under pressure to make more loans to people who do not have a lot of money. This could cause problems in the future.\n\nThe problem with the loans was that some of them were not good. Some people got loans that they could not afford to pay back. This made the banks and the whole economy very sick. The banks had too much money tied up in these bad loans. When the people who took the loans could not pay them back, the banks lost a lot of money. This made a big problem for the economy.\n\nThe government and the banks made a system that was too complicated. They used many different kinds of loans and sold them to other people. This made it difficult for people to understand what was happening with their money. The banks and other companies got a lot of money from these loans, but they did not have enough money to pay back the people who had given them the money.\n\nThe problem was so big that many banks had a lot of debt. The top five banks in the United States had a total of four trillion dollars of debt. This is a very big number. The government had to step in to help the banks and the economy. The government took control of two big companies called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They had a lot of debt, five trillion dollars, and the government had to take care of it.",
            "Exposition is a problem for many writers. It is the part of a story where the writer tells too much about the past or a situation. This can be boring for the reader. They might fall asleep or stop reading. A writer's goal is to 'show' the reader what is happening, not 'tell' them.\n\nFor example, if a character meets someone and tells them too much about their past, this can be boring. It is better to show the reader how the character feels and what they think through their actions and words.\n\nThink about a story where a woman meets her husband. She tells the reader that they met, got married, and he was murdered in front of her. The reader might expect this to take two pages, but it would be better for the writer to show how the husband loves his wife and how she feels about him. This way, the reader can become emotionally involved and care about the story.\n\nA writer needs to add 'meat' to the story, not just bones. This means showing the reader the characters and their feelings, not just telling them about the plot.\n\nSometimes, it is tempting to rush past certain details. For instance, a character might tell the reader about their past, such as being in the Air Force or owning a gas station. But this can be boring. It is better to show the reader through the character's actions and words.\n\nA good writer knows how to balance telling and showing. They make the story interesting and engaging for the reader.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. His name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. The news program did not spend much time on this story. It said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nI think they spent the right amount of time on this story. \n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was very badly hurt. There was no one arrested yet. The police were investigating. This story seemed short. I think it was because the victim was a black man. In the past, I have noticed that when a black person is a victim of a crime, they do not get as much attention. \n\nThe news program talked about a hole in a helicopter. They said it was shot with a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward for information about the shooter.\n\nThey also said there will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be warm.\n\nThey talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road. A man robbed the store. The news program said he was a black man and was wearing a hoodie. They said he was tall and heavy. I thought they spent too much time talking about his skin color.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a drug dealer from Texas. He was convicted of selling marijuana in Ohio. The news program said he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. It is a connection that is very hard to break. Inside this connection, many feelings exist. They include love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They see themselves in their brother. When things are very bad, the true nature of this connection is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they can cause a lot of problems. To understand the feelings that come from being brothers, you must deal with the problems that come with them.\n\nWhen one brother looks at another and sees himself, he sees himself the way he really is. He sees his true character in his actions and the consequences of those actions. The story “The Scarlet Ibis” shows this connection between brothers. The story is about two brothers and the strong feelings that come with their bond. These two brothers go on a journey through a beautiful place. They have a lot of strong feelings, like pride and hurt. In the end, only one brother lives.\n\nThe story shows what the brothers feel through the main character, Doodle, and how he acts with his brother. It also shows the feelings of the narrator, who tells the story. The narrator's feelings influence how the main character sees the world. This affects how he acts.\n\nThe main character feels one strong feeling: pride. He takes his little brother, Doodle, on many adventures. But Doodle is very sick and cannot do the things the main character wants him to do. The main character is very unhappy about this. He wishes he had a brother he could teach and play with. He wanted a brother to share his life with. But Doodle's sickness makes this impossible.\n\nThe main character is even angry with Doodle sometimes. He even thought about hurting him. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels happy. This shows that he truly loves his brother. He wants to help Doodle and make him happy.",
            "The brain is a very complicated part of our body. It helps us think and learn. As time has passed, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. First, people thought of the brain like a piece of paper. Then they thought of it like a book. Now, many people think of it like a computer. However, these ideas are not perfect and can lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation comes into the brain from our senses. Our senses are our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. They turn things like touch, heat, sound, and light into signals. The brain changes these signals many times. This helps us understand what we see and hear.\n\nThere are two ways the brain changes these signals. One way is from small pieces of information to bigger pieces. The other way is from using what we know to help us understand things faster. For example, if you see a picture of a box, the brain first puts together small pieces of information like color and shape. Then, it uses what we know to decide that it is a box.\n\nThe brain also decides which signals are important and which ones we should pay attention to. For example, when you look at your shoes, your brain doesn't notice every single blade of grass. But if someone says your name, you might hear it even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain has different ways to store information. There are three types: sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain must put the information into a form it can understand. There are different ways to do this, like looking at what a word looks like, hearing how it sounds, or knowing what it means.\n\nOnce the information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies with animals show that working memory, which lasts about 20 seconds, is like a signal in a special group of brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the shape of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to think about how the brain stores and uses information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others come from computer science, and others come from studying the brain. One idea is that the brain uses nodes, like links in a chain, to connect related ideas. For example, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley wrote a book called Brave New World. It is a story about a bad future where people are controlled by a person called the World Controller. The people in this story do not value the individual. They value the community above all else. They are taught to be happy from a young age. But they are not really free. They are like pawns in a game.\n\nHuxley was afraid of a future where people are controlled by technology and money. He showed this in his story. The people in the story are not allowed to think for themselves. They do what they are told. They are not allowed to love or feel strong emotions. They just want to be happy and not be unhappy.\n\nHuxley used ideas from Marxism in his story. In Marxism, people who are poor and work hard are kept down by people who are rich and powerful. In Brave New World, the poor people are kept down by the World Controller and the rich people who are born with special bodies and brains. They call these people Alphas and Betas. They are in charge and the others have to do what they are told.\n\nThe people in the story do not know that they are being controlled. They just want to be happy and have fun. They do not know about the people who are in charge and how they are being controlled. Huxley showed this in his story. He made it seem like the people in the story are happy, but really they are not free.\n\nThe people in the story do not have relationships with each other. They just interact with each other in a shallow way. They do not love each other or feel deep emotions. They are just like machines. Huxley was showing how people can become like machines if they are controlled by technology and money.\n\nHuxley was warning people about the dangers of a future where people are controlled by technology and money. He showed how people can become like machines and lose their free will. He showed how people can be kept down by those in power and not know it.",
            "I have been a student here at University Park for two and a half years. Traveling on campus can be hard for many students, including me. My first year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room. It was far from the center of campus. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building, near the center, could take 25 minutes on foot. The weather in State College is often bad.\n\nI talked to an old student. He said that not long ago, East Halls was far from the rest of campus. Now, there are many new buildings and apartments. As the campus grows, getting from one place to another gets harder. The best way to solve mobility problems on campus is with a bike. But bikes alone are not enough. Students must ride them, and the campus must be made for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rode a bike again after a few years. He said, “Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.” Besides being good for your body, biking is the most efficient way to travel. I live off campus, not near the center of campus. Last year, I bought a bike. It was a smart decision. I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home. If I ride my bike fast, it only takes 5 minutes. However, Pollock Road is not easy to ride on. I like biking because I am too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would take too much time. Every week, it would be over two and a half hours. I don’t have time for that."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to work in social work with the Division of Family and Children Services. I want to help children who are hurt or neglected and support families who are having problems. Important values for me in social work are: helping others, respecting people, being honest, and improving my skills to be a good worker. These values are important for social workers and also for me personally.\n\nI have always wanted to help others. In high school and college, I saw people who were unhappy but did not know how to help themselves. I decided to study psychology in college. After I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I was not sure what job to do. But one day, I met a teenager who was being hurt by his parents. I wanted to help him, so I went to the police and told them what I knew. They asked me to talk to the parents. When I talked to them, they were not honest about what was happening to the teenager. This made me decide to work in social work to help children who are being hurt by their families.\n\nAnother important value for me is fair treatment for everyone. We say that every person is important, but sometimes we do not act that way. I believe in being different and not following what others do. In school, I fought for what I believed in, like being against unfairness and racism. I will continue to stand up for what is right.",
            "This paper looks at two ways to understand sleep problems called insomnia. The first way is biological. It looks at what the body does and what happens when it is not working right. This includes things like genes and the body's health. The second way is sociocultural. It looks at how the world around us affects our sleep. This includes things like culture, race, and our economic situation.\n\nInsomnia can be caused by different things. It can be a primary problem, a problem that is connected to another mental health issue, or a problem caused by a medical condition or something we put into our body.\n\nThe biological model of sleep problems looks at how our bodies work. Our genes and brain cells help us sleep and stay awake. A study on mice found that special receptors in the brain help us sleep and wake up. If these receptors are not working right, we can have trouble sleeping. A medicine that helps these receptors work better made the mice sleep longer.\n\nThis study shows that our genes and the world around us can affect our sleep. If we are born with a problem with these receptors, we may have trouble sleeping. This can affect our daily life and make it hard to focus and do things.\n\nThe sociocultural model of sleep problems looks at how the world around us affects our sleep. This includes things like our family, friends, and where we live. Insomnia can be caused by different things like our culture, our economic situation, and our age.\n\nFor example, a study found that people in some cultures sleep less than people in other cultures. This can be because of the way they live or the things they do. A person's economic situation can also affect their sleep. If they do not have a good place to live or are worried about money, they may have trouble sleeping.\n\nThe strengths of these studies are that they help us understand why people have insomnia and how to treat it. However, they also have weaknesses. They do not always explain why people have insomnia and they do not always work for everyone.",
            "**Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD)**\n\n**What is CAPD?**\n\nCAPD is a disorder that affects how the brain uses sound information. It is not the same as hearing loss. People with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain has trouble understanding and processing them. This can make it hard to understand speech, especially in noisy places.\n\n**History of CAPD**\n\nThe idea of CAPD started in the 1950s. Researchers were studying children with communication problems. In 1954, a team of researchers began creating tests for these children. In 1961, another researcher created a test to check how the brain processes sound. A big meeting in 1977 helped researchers learn more about CAPD.\n\n**How CAPD Affects People**\n\nCAPD can cause many problems. Some people with CAPD:\n\n- Have trouble finding the source of a sound\n- Have trouble telling two or more sounds apart\n- Have trouble recognizing patterns in sounds\n- Have trouble understanding changes in speech\n- Have trouble hearing one sound when another sound comes after it\n- Have trouble putting together sound clues\n- Have trouble understanding the order of sounds\n\n**Diagnosing CAPD**\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a professional must watch how a person behaves when listening and give them tests to check their listening abilities. These tests can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. There is no one test that can diagnose CAPD for sure, and we do not know what causes it.\n\n**Helping Students with CAPD in the Classroom**\n\nTeachers can help students with CAPD in many ways. They can:\n\n- Give students extra time to understand instructions\n- Use visual aids to help them understand\n- Minimize background noise in the classroom\n- Encourage students to ask for help when they do not understand\n- Use simple language and repeat instructions\n- Provide extra help when needed",
            "The play Twelfth Night talks about a big problem. The play says that using a disguise can be helpful when you want to trick people. But it can also cause big problems. If you stay with the disguise too long, you can lose your real self.\n\nOne problem with stopping a trick is that you may hurt people who trusted you. They might not forgive you. Some people will not be angry, but others will be very upset.\n\nThe play talks about people who change their gender. This is called gender role reversal. This is a big problem because it makes people ask questions. Why do people change their gender? Why do they want to hide who they really are?\n\nIn the play, a woman named Viola wants to be a man. She wants to protect herself. She feels safe when she is a man. Viola's plan works, but it puts her in a hard situation. She is alone and cannot talk to the women she knows. She is also in love with a man, and he is in love with her, but he thinks she is a man.\n\nThe play also shows that sometimes people hide their feelings. They do not say what they really want. In the play, a woman named Olivia falls in love with Viola, but she thinks Viola is a man. This makes Olivia's feelings confusing. It shows that people can have secret feelings that they do not talk about.\n\nThe play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful, but it can also cause big problems. People may lose their real selves or hurt the people they love. The play also talks about people hiding their feelings. It shows that people can have secret feelings that they do not talk about.",
            "The German colonial rule in Africa was known for being very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. But the German colonial rule was not the same everywhere. It was different in different places. Education in the colonies was also different. When the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many Africans who could read and write. The German government had done a good job in educating them. But in South West Africa, the situation was very different.\n\nMost Africans in South West Africa were not educated. They could not read or write. The government did not help much with education. Instead, missionary groups tried to educate the Africans. The government gave them some money, but not much. They also helped European students a lot. They built schools for them and controlled the schools that the missionaries ran. This made a big difference in South West Africa. Other German colonies had many educated Africans, but South West Africa did not.\n\nWhy was South West Africa so different? There were many reasons. We want to find out what these reasons were. We also want to look at how the people who lived in the colonies and the government thought about the Africans. There is a lot of information about education in the German colonies. Most of this information is in German and was written a long time ago. Some people have written about the differences in education in the different colonies. One important study is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa. He said that the number of white settlers in South West Africa was one reason why education was different there.\n\nSouth West Africa was a relatively nice place to live. It was not too hot and not too cold. Many Europeans moved there. By 1913, 15,000 Europeans lived in South West Africa. This was a lot more than in other colonies.",
            "Music called Popular Music has grown a lot over 100 years. It now includes many kinds. It is hard to make a list of all kinds. Many kinds of music, like rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, have smaller kinds. Heavy Metal rock is a popular kind of music now. It is special because it shows a wide range of feelings. It often shows darker feelings. Many people started their own kind of Heavy Metal music. This made many smaller kinds of music. This chain of kinds continues today.\n\nHeavy metal music today is hard to understand. It has many different kinds of music. It has taken ideas from other kinds of music. But it started from something. To understand heavy metal music now, we need to know where it started and why it is a movement.\n\nHeavy Metal music is often dark. It is often loud and wild. It is often about strong feelings. People who play Heavy Metal music are very good at their instruments. This is clear in the music. Heavy Metal music also started with people taking drugs. There was a big time when people took drugs in the 1970s. This led to people making strange and crazy music. They used the drugs as an excuse for their music. Heavy Metal music has many dark qualities. This was new in popular music. Later, younger Heavy Metal groups took ideas from the past. They made music with dark and wild ideas. Some examples of this are in the song \"Helter Skelter\". This song shows the dark side of the Beatles. It is like a rollercoaster with ups and downs. Some people think this is one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles wrote it as a challenge to another group, the Rolling Stones. They wanted to show they could make loud and dark music too.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous French painter. He made his paintings in a style called Post-Impressionism. His painting called \"The Dream\" shows a woman looking at a beautiful place in her dreams. This painting is also about Rousseau's own dreams and wishes.\n\nRousseau wanted many things in his life. He wanted other artists and people to accept and like his paintings. He wanted recognition and praise for his work. But he had a big problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he was not sure how to do it.\n\nTo understand \"The Dream\" better, we need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born on May 21, 1844, in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. Rousseau did not go to art school. He worked for the government in France for forty years. When his wife and eight children died, he was left with only one daughter. He was very sad. He started painting to feel better and to start a new life.\n\nRousseau was a folk painter. He painted about everyday people and things. He was like an average person, not a king or a rich person. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but it was very hard. Many other artists were famous and good. Rousseau started painting late in his life. He did not get famous until a man named Matisse became a famous artist.\n\nThe book Modern French Painters says that Rousseau and Matisse were different. Matisse did not want to make boring paintings. Rousseau wanted to make paintings that were so good that people would accept him as a real artist.",
            "Many people think that ethics and art are connected. They believe that truth and beauty are the same thing. A famous writer, John Keats, said this in a poem. He said that beauty and truth are the same thing, and that is all we need to know about them.\n\nWe learn many things in life through education and experience. But we know that ethics and art are special. They are not like things we learn in school. We appreciate them without being taught. Ethics and art are like descriptions of something, not rules to follow.\n\nWhen we talk about art or ethics, we try to explain what makes something good or beautiful. But we cannot fully explain it. We can talk about the colors, shapes, and textures of a painting. But in the end, that does not tell us why it is good art. When we talk about our favorite art or literature, we often say, \"There's just something about it.\" This is hard to explain.\n\nI think that ethics and art are similar in this way. No matter how well we describe something, there is something more that we cannot explain. A woman writer, Flannery O'Connor, said that stories are like this too. She said that stories are a way to say something that cannot be said in words.\n\nI think that ethics and art are connected because they are both about something we feel deeply. They are not just things we learn in school. They are things we experience, but cannot fully explain. This is why we find ethics and art so important.\n\nA writer, McKean, said that literature is unique because it has a moral quality. Literature is about values. It is about what is right and wrong. We find values in literature and in life. We like literature because it helps us understand what is important.",
            "Germany is a strong country. It is a united place with a special culture. This culture is felt from the Alps in München to the city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea. It is also felt in Köln on the Rhine River and in the city of Dresden on the Elbe River.\n\nThis unique culture comes from many different groups and tribes. Germany has a long history. People have lived there for a long time.\n\nThe place called Germania is the home of the Germans. But where did the name Germania come from? Many scholars and historians do not agree. One historian said the name came from a group of people called the Tungrians. They were a Germanic tribe that lived on the other side of the Rhine River.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book. He used the word \"Germanus\" when he wrote about the wars with the Gauls. He took this word from the Gauls themselves. Caesar used it to show the difference between the Gauls and the Germans.\n\nSome people think the name Germania came from a spear that the Germans used in battles. Others think it came from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which means \"to shout.\" This might mean the Germans were loud. \n\nA historian named Tacitus wrote about the Germans in his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He said the Germans were the original people of the area. They did not mix with other groups. They lived in a wild country with bad weather and tough people.\n\nThe Romans did not live in Germania. They would go there to get goods and to fight battles. They would then go back to their big empire. The Germanic tribes lived on the border of the Roman Empire. They would trade with the Romans and fight for them.",
            "I stood still, looking at the picture in front of me. My mind was not working well. I did not understand the scene. It was like looking at something new and strange. Ideas came into my mind, but they went away quickly. My mind was like a calm and clear stream, but it had no thoughts. \n\nI had always wanted to learn how to draw. When I was six years old, I started to think about it. I found a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" It teaches people how to draw. The book says to put a square around a picture to make it easier to understand. This helps us see the main things in the picture. I tried to do this, but I could not. The picture in front of me was too complicated. I was too surprised and amazed. I just stood and looked at it. \n\nArtists have different styles. Picasso used blue, Monet liked green and yellow. The old Italian artists used many colors. If I wanted to be a good artist, I had to start by looking at this picture. This could be the start of my art. I called it \"Work in Brown.\" I picked up a pencil and started to draw. My hand moved smoothly over the paper. I was in a good place, creating something new. But then my hand jerked and went to the toilet handle. I had to clean up a mess. Someone had left a big, brown pile of waste in the toilet. I used a mop to clean it up. I was not happy about it. I wore a green tie and my feet were apart. I stared at the mess and thought about it. I made my hand into a glove to protect it from the mess. Then I put my hand into the toilet and cleaned it up.",
            "Many young drivers die in car accidents. Several factors cause this problem. The brain of a teenager is not ready for the dangers of driving. Teenagers do not have enough experience. This lack of experience causes many more accidents and makes them drive too fast, drive off the road, or turn over their cars. Teenagers also drive worse when their friends are with them.\n\nA study in California found that how old the passenger is and how many traffic accidents happen are connected. To make driving safer for teenagers, some states give them temporary licenses that limit how many hours they can drive and do not allow them to drive with other minors.\n\nBut these temporary licenses are not a long-term solution. The main problem is that teenagers, as a group, are not good at handling the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says that 18 is too young for a driver's license. He did research that shows many young people want to take risks and do exciting things. This means that teenagers should not drive until they are a little older and are less likely to take risks. If we continue to give driver's licenses to young teenagers, many more people will be killed in car accidents.\n\nA simple law could solve this problem. Schools could teach driver's education classes to help teenagers learn how to drive. No one under 18 could drive a car. Before getting a full driver's license, teenagers could get a temporary permit and practice driving with an adult. The number of practice hours could be the same as in most states. Because many states have similar problems, a national law would be a good way to make driving safer for teenagers.\n\nThis idea is not new. Many states have already tried it. It would work and save many lives.",
            "I looked at movies from the early days of film at the Library of Congress. I wanted to watch all the trick films. These films were made between eighteen ninety-five and nineteen hundred one. There were fifteen of them. Trick films use editing to create illusions. My study of film looked at how trick films use creative editing to make people believe what they see. I also looked at how some films from the end of the nineteenth century began to break the rules of film-making.\n\nOne thing that many trick films have in common is that they were made in a studio with a stage in the front. The camera does not move from this position to follow people or objects. This style of making films came from the theatre and magic shows. Because of this style, people in the films usually do not move towards or away from the camera. In the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel,\" actors enter from one side and move back and forth. They stay in the same place. The camera does not follow them when they leave the frame.\n\nMost trick films use long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are not used in these films. This is because in theatre and magic shows, the audience sees the entire performance at one time. In early films, actors do not move towards the camera, so close-ups are not possible.\n\nMost trick films are short, about one minute or less. They focus on simple tricks, like magic or disappearing acts. But sometimes, one conceptual shot in a film can be made up of several physical shots. For example, in the film \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" is part of a single conceptual shot.",
            "John Taylor was a well-known American. He liked farming. He was a strong supporter of the Republican party. Taylor was for personal freedom and against a big government. He believed that farming was the best kind of work. His ideas about farming helped form his opinions on government. He thought the government should not interfere with people's lives.\n\nTaylor believed America had a great chance to make a perfect government. The country was new, so there were no old ideas to get in the way. He believed people have natural rights. These rights are important and should be protected. If one person's rights are taken, all people's rights are at risk.\n\nTaylor said that in the wild, strong people and mean people do well. But in a society, this should not be true. He believed a good government should understand that people are good and bad. He thought good principles are important for a government. Good principles protect private property and help farmers. They also make sure people do not take advantage of others. A good government will work well even if its leaders are not perfect. Leaders are often led by selfishness.\n\nTaylor wanted a government that is strict and follows the Constitution. He did not want a big government with many powers. He thought a big government is expensive and can be evil. But he also believed that a simple reading of the Constitution can be bad if it does not consider the writers' intentions. Taylor thought the Declaration of Independence is the real charter of the United States. It says the country is a group of separate states, not one country.",
            "A look at the numbers shows a big drop in people using the commuter log in the third month of the project. This was a little disappointing. It is not easy to say why this happened.\n\nWinter was coming to the school. Many people were riding bicycles or walking less. This might explain some of the drop. December is a busy time for students and teachers. They are finishing their work and preparing for grades. They might forget to use the commuter log. In December, people also start thinking about holidays. This means many students and teachers do not need to come to school for a month. Classes start again in late January. This might also be the reason for the low numbers. But we still do not know why the numbers were low in February.\n\nOne idea is that all projects have a lot of energy at the start. Then the energy goes down. We tried to fix this by creating a special week to use the log more, called Carpool Challenge Week in March. This worked and more people used the log in March.\n\nAnother problem we faced was that people like to drive cars. It is a part of our culture. We need to give people good reasons to use other ways to get to school. We gave prizes like gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, and a bookstore. It would be interesting to see if bigger prizes would help. For example, we could have given away a bicycle or a new car. This might have stopped the decline in participation.\n\nThe prizes we gave out did not change much. If we had increased the prizes as the project went on, this might have helped. The gift cards were good at first, but adding bigger prizes in December and January might have made people want to use the log more.",
            "An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a kind of investment. It follows an index, a group of stocks, or a basket of assets. But it is more flexible and trades like a stock on the stock market. An ETF gives you the benefits of owning many stocks together and the freedom to make decisions like buying or selling quickly. It also has lower costs than many other kinds of investments.\n\nThe benefits of ETFs are attractive. But there are some downsides. You have to pay a fee for each trade, like you would for buying or selling a stock. There are also many different kinds of ETFs to choose from.\n\nThis text will look at one ETF called IHF. We will compare it to the top 10 stocks that make up most of the ETF. We want to know if owning the ETF is like owning the top 10 stocks combined. We also want to see if there are better ways to combine these stocks for better results.\n\nTo make our report easier to read, we will only look at the top 10 stocks. They make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here are the top 10 stocks and how much they make up of the entire ETF.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the whole ETF, we will use a chart. The chart shows how much each stock contributes to the ETF's performance. We will also see how much each stock contributes to the ETF's risk.\n\nOur chart shows that a portfolio of only the top 10 stocks would earn 6.11% more than the ETF. It would also be less sensitive to market movements. This means that the top 10 stocks might be a good choice for some investors. But we need to be sure that these results are not just a coincidence.\n\nTo do this, we will look at the standard deviation of each stock. Standard deviation shows us how much a stock can move up or down in value. We will compare the standard deviation of the top 10 stocks to the standard deviation of the ETF IHF. This will help us know if owning the ETF or the top 10 stocks is the better choice.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe wrote a famous poem called \"Dream-Land\". It is one of his best works. Poe used the word \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56 of the poem. This word \"Thulé\" comes from Virgil. Virgil used it to name a island north of Britain, which the Greeks thought was the edge of the world.\n\nBut Poe was also influenced by another writer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". It was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. In the second part of \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". It tells a story about a king who loses his wife and drinks too much, remembering her. The king then decides to die.\n\nPoe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is similar to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\". They both describe a sad and lonely place called Thulé. The place is dark and without color. The speaker in Poe's poem is haunted by dead friends. This is like the king in Goethe's poem, who is lonely and sad after losing his wife.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe probably knew about. Poe admired a writer named Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and it is likely Poe was also familiar with Goethe's work. Many copies of Goethe's books were made after its first publication. Poe was interested in German writers, and Goethe was one of the most famous German writers of his time.\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" twice in his writings. Once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land\" as the beginning and ending of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together as two related poems. They both describe a sad and lonely place.",
            "In California law, can a customer hurt in a store get extra money as punishment? This customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell in a store after an applesauce spill. She was hurt badly. She thinks the store manager, Paul Martin, was mean on purpose because he knew about the spill twice and did not clean it for 30 minutes. He was eating dinner. Can she prove this in court?\n\nA judge will not throw out Palmer's claim for extra money right away. To get extra money, Palmer must show that Martin was very aware of the harm he could cause and was very careless. She can tell the judge that Martin knew many people were hurt in the store before she fell. He knew this because many people slipped and fell in the store in the past months. But Martin still did nothing to make the store safe. Palmer will argue that Martin was very bad because he did not clean up the spill. But it is not clear how bad he was.\n\nHere are the facts of the case. On October 13, 2009, an employee, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin said he was too busy eating dinner. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, told Martin about the spill. He said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill. Before that, five people slipped and fell in the store in 2009.\n\nPalmer is suing D&D Markets for money because of her injury. Now, we are thinking about asking the judge to throw out part of her claim for extra money. In California, a person can get extra money if the other person was very mean or did something wrong on purpose. This means the other person must have meant to cause harm, or they must have done something very bad and very careless.\n\nTo prove that Martin was very mean, Palmer must show that he was aware of the harm he could cause and still did nothing to stop it. The law says that if a person is very aware of the harm they can cause and still does not stop it, that is very bad. In a past case, a court said that this kind of behavior is very mean.\n\nWe are trying to decide if Palmer can prove that Martin was very mean. We will see if she can show that he knew about the harm he could cause and still did nothing to stop it.",
            "I took a course in Islam at CBC four years ago. There was a big discussion in class about whether Islam is a hostile religion. I still think this question is very important today. Many events since the September 11 attacks have shown me that the media's view of Islam has changed. It used to be very negative, but now it is very positive.\n\nI think it is interesting to read the biography of the Prophet Muhammad. What I have learned about Muhammad's history does not match the picture of him in the biography. I used to think that Muhammad forced people to become Muslims. He would conquer and take control of tribes, and then make them become Muslims. But the biography writes about Muhammad as a kind and humble person. More and more people were attracted to his teachings because they saw his kindness and truth.\n\nThere are some strange similarities between the teachings of Jesus and the miracles of Muhammad. One example is when Muhammad took a little food and made it enough for many people. The way this story is written makes me think that the authors wanted Muhammad to seem like a kind and humble prophet who did not need to prove anything. This makes me think that they are taking away from the miracles and teachings of Jesus. It is like they are trying to take credit for Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nI also have a problem with the stories in the biography. Many of the stories are not from the people who actually saw these things happen. They are told to us by someone who heard it from someone else. This makes me think that the stories are not true.\n\nThe thing that bothers me most is that the biography shows Muhammad as a very kind and humble person. But history tells us that this is not true. I wonder if Muslims today know the real story of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A long time ago, Jesus taught us many things. But his teachings were soon left behind. People continued to think about Jesus and his ideas in different ways. If we look at history, we see a big change. The ideas that Jesus taught are no longer the same as what people believe today.\n\nMost people believe in one God. This idea started with the Jewish people. The Jewish people were a group divided into many parts. They had different ideas about how to live their lives.\n\nThe Jewish people had many different groups. The Sadducees were one group. The Pharisees were another. The Essenes and the Zealots were groups too. Most people were just common people.\n\nThe Roman Empire took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish people were not the same. They had many different ideas.\n\nToday, we see that many people are thinking about Jesus' ideas again. They want to go back to what he originally taught. This will take time. It may take many years or even many centuries. But it will happen. People will start to remove extra ideas that were added to Christianity. They will go back to what Jesus taught.\n\nWhen this starts to happen, people will begin to believe the same things again. They will no longer have many different ideas. This will happen in the United States and Europe. It will happen in all the Christian groups.\n\nThis is not a new thing. It has happened before. Many years ago, the Roman Empire was against the Christians. But later, the Roman Empire became a Christian group. Our country has changed many times. We used to treat African-Americans as slaves. Now we have African-American leaders.\n\nThe same thing will happen in the Christian religion. It will go back to what Jesus taught. To understand what Jesus said, people will read his words as symbols, not as exact statements.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus lived? If we go far back in time, we see only Judaism. This was the base of the Christian religion. The Jewish people believed in one God. They believed that God gave them special messages. And they believed in the Jewish scriptures.",
            "I think the book \"The Jungle\" shows that people are naturally selfish. They want to live good lives, but they do not think about others. This is shown many times in the book. The owners and managers of factories want to make their companies big and strong. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way. They do not care about pollution or hurting animals and people.\n\nAccording to the book, the factories are very dirty. The smoke they make goes up into the air and hurts people. The owners do not care about this. They also do not care about the animals that live nearby. They do not care about the people who work for them. The owners want to get rich and will do anything to do it. They make their workers work too much and then they lay them off without giving them any help. The workers have no protection and are treated very badly.\n\nThe workers were like slaves. They were very poor and had no way to escape their bad situation. They were dependent on the factory owners who were very mean and did not care about them. This made a lot of problems in the community.\n\nThe book says that this is like slavery. The workers were treated very badly and had no rights. This made it hard for them to live a good life. The book shows that people need to be kind and think about others, not just themselves.",
            "Many writers use special techniques to make readers feel a certain way about important ideas. These techniques can be very effective. F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example, uses many of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs a word with its meaning that is not usually together to give readers a certain feeling. He also uses symbols to represent ideas and uses them again later to give readers a reminder of a feeling.\n\nFitzgerald uses many colors in a special way. He gives meanings to colors like white, gray, red, and pink. In The Great Gatsby, he builds up the meaning of white and gray, and then uses it to describe important things.\n\nFitzgerald says white is better and more nice, and gray is older and less nice. He uses these words a lot in the beginning of the book. Many people wear white clothes: Daisy and Jordan wear white, Nick wears white pants, and Tom wears a white shirt. The only time people do not wear white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party. The party is colorful and bright.\n\nFitzgerald also uses white and gray to describe ordinary things. He says some people and places are white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had a happy white childhood together, but later, Daisy is just a white car and a white dress, showing she is not a special person.\n\nFitzgerald uses white and gray to show readers that some people are not important. He uses these colors to describe Daisy in a way that makes her seem like just a normal thing. For example, he describes her wearing a white dress and a gray fur collar. He uses white and gray to show readers that Daisy is not a special character.\n\nFitzgerald uses this technique with other colors too. He gives meanings to red and pink and uses them to describe important things. He wants readers to feel a certain way about these colors and things.",
            "San Diego County is a good place for farming. The climate is warm and sunny. Farmers grow many things here. They grow tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. Many people want to buy food from local farms. There is a big market for organic food in San Diego. This means people want food grown without chemicals. They want organic eggs and milk too. Some farms give tours and let people visit their land. They can walk, watch birds, and have fun.\n\nThis kind of farm is good for the land and for people. The government gives money to farmers who take care of the land. They can also have people visit their farm and learn about farming. But organic farming is harder than other kinds of farming. It needs more work to get rid of bugs and weeds. Farmers need to use natural ways to make the soil good. This can be expensive. It is also harder to make money than with big farms. Small farms need more help to be profitable.\n\nA farm in San Diego County is a good place to talk about this. The farm is near a town called Potrero. It is 160 acres of land with chaparral, grass, and oak trees. The land is near a forest. Many animals live here. Some are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. Others are getting less common and might be in danger soon, like the burrowing owl.\n\nPeople have lived in this area for a long time. First, Native Americans lived here. Then, in the late 1800s, cattle ranchers and people who sold wood came. The land was used for grazing and making wood.\n\nI looked at a real estate website and found a farm in the area. I looked at government programs to see how a small farmer can save money and help the animals. I used a real farm as an example of what someone might do.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any kind of negotiation. Culture is not the same thing everywhere and is not a single thing. We cannot say all people from one country are the same. Understanding a culture is harder than making a general statement about it. It is more useful for a negotiator to know how a culture affects a negotiation and how its values can help or hurt the talks.\n\nWhen we meet a new culture, we compare it to our own culture. We make judgments based on what we know. But it is better to accept a culture as it is and work within its rules. This is especially true when you are in a weaker position in a negotiation. If you are in a different place and country, showing respect for their traditions and values can help you have a successful negotiation.\n\nCulture is not just about countries. Companies also have their own culture. This can be seen in how they dress, how they talk, and who they hire. Some companies work long hours, while others have a more relaxed schedule. Some people work together and help each other, while others work alone.\n\nUnderstanding values is important because it helps us know why people do things. If a culture values saving face, a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or boss. If a culture values making a good deal, a negotiator will not give up easily. Knowing these things can help you have a successful negotiation.\n\nBefore you start negotiating, it is a good idea to learn a little about the other person. This can help you make a good deal. Knowing about the other person's values and culture can help you be a good negotiator.",
            "People say, \"There is no God.\" This is from the Bible in Psalm 14. A man named St. Anselm used this idea. Another man, Thomas Aquinas, also believed in God. Both men wrote about why God exists. We want to know who is right.\n\nWe will start by saying we think they are both right. This way, we can compare their ideas about God. If we allow them to believe in a different kind of God, it's hard to compare their arguments.\n\nSt. Anselm said people can find God in their own minds. He said we cannot think about God not being real. This means God exists because we can think about him. We don't need to look outside ourselves for proof. This idea is called faith. It means believing something is true, even if we can't show it to others.\n\nThomas Aquinas said people can use reason and evidence to know God exists. He didn't need faith. He used five arguments to prove God's existence: change, cause, chance, order, and harmony. He said we can know God exists by thinking about these things.\n\nFor example, if you're given a puzzle with all the pieces except one, you can still know what the missing piece looks like. You don't need to see it to know it exists.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince named Siddhartha was born. He would one day be called the Buddha, which means the leader who has found truth. Before he was the Buddha, he renounced the world and became very wise. His teachings created the religion of Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism is now about two and a half thousand years old. It looks different from when the Buddha was alive. In the country of Sri Lanka, people celebrate an annual ceremony called the water-cutting ceremony. This ceremony is important for the people who follow Theravada Buddhism, a main part of Buddhism.\n\nThe Theravada Buddhist community has changed its ideas about the religion over time. This is because of forces inside the community and from outside. Some forces are good for Buddhism, and some are bad.\n\nSome words are used many times in this discussion. These words are internal, external, hostile, and benign. Internal means something comes from inside the Buddhist group. External means something comes from outside the group. Hostile means something is bad for Buddhism. Benign means something is not bad for Buddhism.\n\nLet's learn about the basic ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the three jewels of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is the Buddha's teachings. The Buddha's teachings are in three groups of text. The Sutta Pitaka has all the important talks of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the world and the universe.\n\nBuddhists believe in some important ideas. These ideas are that there is no permanent soul, that life has suffering, and that everything changes. These ideas help people escape the cycle of death and rebirth. This cycle is called Sansara. When people become enlightened, they will no longer have desire, hatred, and delusion.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Laymen have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not take what is not given, do not have sex with someone who is not your partner, and do not take drugs. Monks have many more rules.\n\nThe most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. The first truth is that life is suffering. The second truth is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "A long time ago, the United States and Mexico were enemies for 57 years. This started in 1836 and ended in 1893. The biggest problem between them happened during the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. The United States won and took over some land from Mexico. This included Texas and the southwest part of the United States.\n\nMany small fights happened between the two countries. But they stopped just before World War I. The reason for the long fight was that Americans and Mexicans had different ideas about religion, culture and tradition. They also had different interests.\n\nThis is not unusual. Countries that share a border often have problems. They have different interests and ideas, which can cause disagreements. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have long-standing problems with their neighbors.\n\nDavid M. Pletcher said, \"The United States has long-standing problems with Mexico and Cuba\" (p. 41). Both of these countries are close to the United States and have been enemies. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nA problem between the United States and Mexico was about religion. Many years ago, Americans were against Catholicism and monarchies. This was also true during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union were enemies. But this time, the problem was about the two countries' different religious ideas.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not trust each other because of the way the English and Spanish treated them in the past. This made it hard for them to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts listed 17 problems between the United States and Mexico during the 57-year fight. Most of these problems were about land and border issues. There were many fights between bandits and outlaws from one side of the border to the other. But when the United States and Mexico used force to control their borders, the problem started to go away.\n\nSchmitt said the problem started to go away when Mexico needed the United States for help (p. 109). The United States also changed its goals from getting more land to helping Mexico economically (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became sick with a disease I did not know I had.\n\nI was a nurse. I chose this job because I wanted a safe and secure life. I did not have those things when I was a child. My friends told me, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\"\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist. But I chose nursing. I am now 46 years old and single. I have no money. I am unable to work. To this day, I am sick. I get money from the government because I am unable to work.

            "The question is: Why do living things change over time? Are there limits that control how they change? In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said, \"Even now, zoologists do not know how to describe simple forms in math.\" This is still true today. Recently, scientists used math to study how mollusks grow their skeletons.\n\nOur study is trying to figure out how to use math and experiments to learn about how living things change over time. We are studying a group of animals called Prunum. We used special pictures of their skeletons to create math formulas. These formulas can help us understand how their skeletons changed over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that moves through space as the animal grows. The shell has many turns, called whorls. Each whorl is like a spiral that grows around a center line. The speed at which the whorls grow can be different. A line between each whorl is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the last one, called the body whorl. The other whorls are called the spire. The tip of the spire is the apex, and the other end is the base.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. When we see the opening of the shell, it is called an apertural view. When we see the top of the shell, it is called an apical view.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the top and draw a line where the first suture starts. We can then count the whorls from that line. We can also use math to draw a path of the shell's growth.\n\nThis path can be represented mathematically and graphically. Once we have a math formula, we can change the parameters and see how the mollusk's skeleton grows.",
            "Indonesia's rate of baby and child deaths has not changed much in the last ten years.  The country is making progress in some areas, but not enough to meet its goals for child and mother health by 2015.  There are many reasons for this problem.  These reasons will be discussed below.  They show that Indonesia needs to make its health system stronger, not just improve programs for specific health problems.\n\nIndonesia is doing better in getting skilled health workers to deliver babies.  Now, 72% of births have a skilled worker present.  But this number includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot help if there are problems during delivery.  So, improvements in this area are not as good as they seem.  In addition, fewer children under five with diarrhea are being treated by health professionals. Data on taking care of new mothers is also incomplete, but it shows that this is a big problem.\n\nToo few babies are delivered by C-section.  This is 4% of all births.  This number shows another problem.  In cities, 7% of babies are delivered by C-section.  But in the countryside, it is only 2%.  This means that healthcare is not available equally across the country.  People in cities are getting better healthcare than people in the countryside.\n\nAnother problem is that wealthy people are getting better healthcare than poor people.  There is a 27% gap in how often people use healthcare services, depending on how much money they have.  Poor people are not using healthcare services because they cannot afford it.\n\nSo, the question is how to improve healthcare for babies and mothers.  Should Indonesia make a plan to solve a specific problem, or should it make the healthcare system stronger?  Some people think that solving a specific problem is a good idea.  This approach has specific goals and can show fast results.  But there are some problems with this approach.  If Indonesia spends a lot of money on one health problem, it may not have enough money for other health problems.  Also, there may be too many programs doing the same thing, and they may not be working together.",
            "Two kinds of books are called Victorian novels. They are classics from a long time ago. These books are about the rich people of the time. But two books, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different. They have many strange and mysterious parts. These parts make the characters in the books more interesting. They help readers understand what the characters think and feel.\n\nIn one book, Oliver Twist, a boy named Oliver has many strange dreams. These dreams show what is inside Oliver's heart. They show his pain and what he knows about the world around him. In another part of the book, Oliver remembers a shooting. He relives the shooting in his mind, like he is dreaming. This shows how scared and helpless Oliver is. He had no control over what happened to him. He was forced to suffer pain and fear. This makes the reader think that Oliver feels like giving up. He has no power over what happens to him.\n\nAnother book, Wuthering Heights, is also a mystery. It has a strange and scary atmosphere. Time is not clear in this book. It is like day and night are mixed up. The days are very long, but they are also very short. The nights are very quiet, but they are also very brief.\n\nThese two books show that sometimes bad things happen to people. They have no control over these things. These books help readers understand how people feel when they are suffering.",
            "I worked with young students in an after-school program. They were in elementary school. I helped them with many subjects, but I was best with English and reading. One boy, Adrian, had trouble reading. He was in third or fourth grade. He could say some words correctly, but others not. It was strange. He was Latino, but he spoke perfect English. I worked with him, but we had problems. Then I met his mother. She did not speak English. She only spoke Spanish. I knew a little Spanish, but it was not very good. We talked a little bit. Then I understood the problem. Adrian could read, but he did not know the English alphabet very well. I am not sure if this helped him, but I hope he is better now.\n\nI tell this story because many students have trouble with languages in school, especially in California. It is not always easy for students who speak English well to read. I think everyone knows this is a problem. What can we do? In Adrian's case, he needed help with the alphabet and pronunciation. But for students who do not speak English very well, the solution is more complicated. There is no one answer. We need a combination of things. These are the dual language system, mainstream classes, private tutors, ESL classes. None of these things will fix the problem by itself.\n\nThe dual language system is a good idea. It is not just for students who speak Spanish. All students can benefit. Studies show that students in bilingual education programs do better in school. Many people are afraid of this idea. They think it is a waste of money and that most students will not benefit. But this is not true. If we use this system in all schools, all students will benefit. But how can we do this? Do we need all teachers to speak two languages? No, this is not possible. But we can have special helpers who speak two languages.",
            "We are told from a young age that there is something bigger than us in the world. Some people go to church or temple to learn about it. Others look inside themselves for answers. Many follow the same religion as their parents, but some people do not believe.\n\nWe search for our own path in life. We try to understand what is important to us. This is called our spirituality. We look for a way to guide us through life.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our front porch. It was raining. The sound of the rain on the roof was loud. My father looked out at the rain. He seemed sad. He was not eating much and was losing his hair. He looked thin.\n\nI wanted to talk to him about how I would miss him when he was gone. But I was afraid. Talking about it would make it more real. So I hugged him and sat close to him. We looked out at the rain together.\n\nMy father died in December when I was twenty-two years old. He was sick for a long time. The doctors said he would not get better. But he lived a little longer because of medicine. I did not want to watch him die.

            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is called an oxymoron, which means two things that do not go together. Ian Watt says this in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. \n\nIn the past, people did not like the Gothic novel. They said it had no real depth. But some people praised it for its spooky and exciting parts. The first Gothic novel was The Castle of Otranto. It was written by Horace Walpole. He used old and new ideas to create a new way of writing.\n\nWalpole used old theatrical ideas and new ideas from modern novels. He called it \"A Gothic Story.\" The Gothic novel uses many old ideas from medieval times. These ideas come from theater, buildings, and customs. People thought the word \"gothic\" was old-fashioned when The Castle of Otranto was published. They thought it was not as good as modern ideas.\n\nThe combination of old and new ideas makes the Gothic novel special. It is why the Gothic novel was popular for a long time and remains interesting even today. \n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a code of honor for knights. It was used in medieval times. The idea of chivalry is used in The Castle of Otranto. It is important because it represents what a good knight should be: brave, honest, and skilled. \n\nGothic writers used the idea of chivalry to say that the world had lost its good values. They wanted to remind people of the good old days. The writer of The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole, wrote during a time of political trouble. He was unhappy with the way society was. He thought that people had lost their good qualities. This idea is seen in his character, Frederic. He is a prince, a leader, and he has been through hard times. He is described as a gallant and courteous knight. This is an exaggeration, but it shows how the idea of chivalry was important in the Gothic novel.",
            "Supply chain management is the way goods move from the customer's order to the final product. This process includes moving goods from raw materials to the customer. The term supply chain management was created in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described the steps to follow to plan, implement, and control the supply chain to make customers happy quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are six key parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give the best service to customers.\n\nProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. It is the base of the supply chain. Production decides how and when goods will be made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to understand customer needs. The market shows what customers want.\n\nOnce managers know what customers want, they decide what goods to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make these goods. They choose a place that is good for making things in large amounts and with high quality, keeping customer needs in mind.\n\nAfter deciding where to make goods, managers focus on planning workloads and taking care of equipment. Production is a very important part of the supply chain. Every detail is important. If details are not planned well, it can cost the company time and money.\n\nFor example, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of their business. They have a design for employee uniforms and a plan for receiving shipments from trucks. Having plans helps companies work smoothly and without confusion.\n\nThe second key part of supply chain management is supply. Supply is about making good decisions about a company's strengths and partnerships. A company may have many parts that make different things. Managers decide which part is best for each job. They may also decide to work with other companies to make things. This is called outsourcing.

The sign says: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma is a country in Southeast Asia. The government there is very bad. Many people do not like the government.\n\nIn 2007, people in Burma started protesting. They were very unhappy with their government. The protests were led by many Buddhist monks. They wore yellow robes. The people of Burma started to support the monks. At first, the government allowed the monks to gather but then the government became angry. The government used force against the monks. The military invaded monasteries and hurt many people. Foreign journalists were arrested. A Japanese reporter named Kenji Nagai was killed in 2007. He was reporting on the protests. Many people were killed. But few people know the real number. Colonel Hla Win said more than 13 people were killed. He said the number is in thousands.\n\nThis is not new. Governments want to control people and stop them from speaking out. This has been happening for a long time. In ancient Rome, the leaders said they were chosen by gods to rule. In Japan, the emperor is considered a god. Our president, George W. Bush, met with a man named Ted Haggard. He is a leader of a group that wants to help the government.\n\nThere are many examples of bad things that have happened. In 1989, many people in China were unhappy with their government. They gathered in Tiananmen Square to protest. Many people were killed. The government said 200-300 people were killed. But some groups said it was 2,000-3,000 people. In Rwanda, many people were killed in the 1990s. The government helped to kill people because of their ethnic group. Hitler's government in Germany was very bad. They killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington's music is famous because of his long life and his ability to make great music. He kept composing and directing his orchestra for a long time. Ellington was a good pianist, but he was a better composer. He wrote many complex pieces that showed the special talents of each musician in his orchestra. These pieces were often very good for soloists, who could improvise freely. Ellington also wrote pieces with strong melodies that suited each musician's style. He was very good at creating a good sound for his orchestra as a whole, making each piece unique.\n\nIn many pieces, Ellington used the voice as a musical instrument. He did this to add color and texture to his music. One early example is Creole Love Call, a slow blues piece. This piece has six parts. Each part is different, but they all work well together. In the first part, the singer and the reeds play a call-and-response pattern, with the singer singing smoothly and then more loudly. In the second part, a trumpet plays a solo. In the third part, a clarinet plays a fast, high melody, and the piano plays a syncopated pattern. The fourth part is like the first part, but with more instruments. In the fifth part, the reeds play the call-and-response pattern, and the brass and rhythm sections play together in a special way. In the sixth part, the singer and the reeds play the call-and-response pattern again, but this time the singer sounds like a saxophone. The last part is a short tag with a vocal run and a strange ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of the voice in his music is just one example of his style. His music often has a lot of different sounds and textures, which makes it very interesting. He was a good composer because he knew how to use the special talents of each musician in his orchestra. He also knew how to create good sounds for his orchestra as a whole.\n\nIn his next pieces, such as Hot and Bothered, Ellington used his skill at writing tight compositions and his ear for sound color. In this piece, a call-and-response pattern between a trumpet and a singer creates a rich and complementary sound. In another piece, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington used a trombone to introduce the melody. These are just a few examples of Ellington's great ability to make music.",
            "She had a feeling that something was missing. This feeling started when she was fourteen and getting older. It was still there three years later, at seventeen. She wanted something, but she didn't know what. She wanted a person, not a thing. But she didn't like any boys. Some boys tried to show her attention, but she didn't feel anything.\n\nShe thought about this a lot. She tried to figure out what was wrong. She thought of different ideas, but none made sense. So she continued living her life, thinking about her feelings.\n\nHer home was usually a peaceful place. Her parents were good people. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her. They wanted her to be independent and have her own ideas. Her personality was strong, and her parents were calm. This made her a happy person.\n\nBut today was not a peaceful day. She walked around the house looking for ideas. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. She quickly went to the room and saw her mother on the floor in pain. Her mother was saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The daughter ran to her mother and put a hand on her to help. \"I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother said. The daughter helped her mother to the car.\n\nAt the hospital, she smelled strong cleaning smells and sickness. She was too worried about her mother to be scared. She carried her mother quickly and called for help. Doctors came and took her mother to be seen. The daughter sat and worried.\n\nHer mother fell off a step stool while trying to get something from a high cabinet.",
            "This study was to see if following the \"Mediterranean Diet\" helps prevent heart disease and stroke. The study looked at how a \"Mediterranean Diet Score\" relates to these problems. The Mediterranean Diet is a healthy eating plan that includes many plant foods, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains, and less saturated fat and animal products.\n\nPast studies showed that eating this way can help people live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke or stroke deaths. This new study wanted to find out more about the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old. These women were part of a big study of 121,700 nurses in 11 states in the US. The researchers counted how well each woman followed the Mediterranean Diet six times between 1984 and 2004. They used a food diary to ask the women about what they ate.\n\nThe study found that women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. They also had a lower risk of death from heart disease or stroke. The women who ate this way were about 29% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nThe researchers also looked at other factors that could affect the results, like age, smoking, weight, and physical activity. They found that the women who followed the Mediterranean Diet closely were less likely to have heart disease or stroke even after taking these factors into account.\n\nOverall, this study shows that following the Mediterranean Diet can help prevent heart disease and stroke in women.",
            "In the year two thousand seven, a big financial problem happened in the United States of America. Many people lost their jobs, the value of homes went down, and some very big companies went out of business. This problem is still happening today. We need to ask why this problem happened and how to stop it. \n\nThe financial problem was caused by bad choices made by leaders. They made banks and companies give loans to people who could not pay them back. These loans were given to people who did not have enough money. When these people could not pay their loans, the banks did not have enough money to pay back the people who had given them the money. This made a big problem for the banks and the whole economy.\n\nA long time before this happened, in the year nineteen ninety-nine, the President of the United States wanted to stay in office for a second time. To do this, he made rules that made it easier for people to get loans. This made it more likely that people would not be able to pay back their loans. A man named Steven Holmes from the New York Times wrote about this in nineteen ninety-nine. He said the company that makes many of the loans for homes, called Fannie Mae, was under pressure to make more loans to people who do not have a lot of money. This could cause problems in the future.\n\nThe problem with the loans was that some of them were not good. Some people got loans that they could not afford to pay back. This made the banks and the whole economy very sick. The banks had too much money tied up in these bad loans. When the people who took the loans could not pay them back, the banks lost a lot of money. This made a big problem for the economy.\n\nThe government and the banks made a system that was too complicated. They used many different kinds of loans and sold them to other people. This made it difficult for people to understand what was happening with their money. The banks and other companies got a lot of money from these loans, but they did not have enough money to pay back the people who had given them the money.\n\nThe problem was so big that many banks had a lot of debt. The top five banks in the United States had a total of four trillion dollars of debt. This is a very big number. The government had to step in to help the banks and the economy. The government took control of two big companies called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They had a lot of debt, five trillion dollars, and the government had to take care of it.",
            "Exposition is a problem for many writers. It is the part of a story where the writer tells too much about the past or a situation. This can be boring for the reader. They might fall asleep or stop reading. A writer's goal is to 'show' the reader what is happening, not 'tell' them.\n\nFor example, if a character meets someone and tells them too much about their past, this can be boring. It is better to show the reader how the character feels and what they think through their actions and words.\n\nThink about a story where a woman meets her husband. She tells the reader that they met, got married, and he was murdered in front of her. The reader might expect this to take two pages, but it would be better for the writer to show how the husband loves his wife and how she feels about him. This way, the reader can become emotionally involved and care about the story.\n\nA writer needs to add 'meat' to the story, not just bones. This means showing the reader the characters and their feelings, not just telling them about the plot.\n\nSometimes, it is tempting to rush past certain details. For instance, a character might tell the reader about their past, such as being in the Air Force or owning a gas station. But this can be boring. It is better to show the reader through the character's actions and words.\n\nA good writer knows how to balance telling and showing. They make the story interesting and engaging for the reader.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The main story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. His name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his picture, and he looked very bad. The news program did not spend much time on this story. It said he hurt his wife many times and was arrested.\n\nI think they spent the right amount of time on this story. \n\nThe next story was about a man named Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and was very badly hurt. There was no one arrested yet. The police were investigating. This story seemed short. I think it was because the victim was a black man. In the past, I have noticed that when a black person is a victim of a crime, they do not get as much attention. \n\nThe news program talked about a hole in a helicopter. They said it was shot with a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. They are offering a five-thousand-dollar reward for information about the shooter.\n\nThey also said there will be rain and thunderstorms on Saturday. The temperature will be warm.\n\nThey talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road. A man robbed the store. The news program said he was a black man and was wearing a hoodie. They said he was tall and heavy. I thought they spent too much time talking about his skin color.\n\nAnother story was about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a drug dealer from Texas. He was convicted of selling marijuana in Ohio. The news program said he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. They also said he was Hispanic. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong connection between brothers. It is a connection that is very hard to break. Inside this connection, many feelings exist. They include love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They see themselves in their brother. When things are very bad, the true nature of this connection is clear. It can be good or bad. When these feelings are clear, they can cause a lot of problems. To understand the feelings that come from being brothers, you must deal with the problems that come with them.\n\nWhen one brother looks at another and sees himself, he sees himself the way he really is. He sees his true character in his actions and the consequences of those actions. The story “The Scarlet Ibis” shows this connection between brothers. The story is about two brothers and the strong feelings that come with their bond. These two brothers go on a journey through a beautiful place. They have a lot of strong feelings, like pride and hurt. In the end, only one brother lives.\n\nThe story shows what the brothers feel through the main character, Doodle, and how he acts with his brother. It also shows the feelings of the narrator, who tells the story. The narrator's feelings influence how the main character sees the world. This affects how he acts.\n\nThe main character feels one strong feeling: pride. He takes his little brother, Doodle, on many adventures. But Doodle is very sick and cannot do the things the main character wants him to do. The main character is very unhappy about this. He wishes he had a brother he could teach and play with. He wanted a brother to share his life with. But Doodle's sickness makes this impossible.\n\nThe main character is even angry with Doodle sometimes. He even thought about hurting him. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels happy. This shows that he truly loves his brother. He wants to help Doodle and make him happy.",
            "The brain is a very complicated part of our body. It helps us think and learn. As time has passed, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. First, people thought of the brain like a piece of paper. Then they thought of it like a book. Now, many people think of it like a computer. However, these ideas are not perfect and can lead to mistakes.\n\nInformation comes into the brain from our senses. Our senses are our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. They turn things like touch, heat, sound, and light into signals. The brain changes these signals many times. This helps us understand what we see and hear.\n\nThere are two ways the brain changes these signals. One way is from small pieces of information to bigger pieces. The other way is from using what we know to help us understand things faster. For example, if you see a picture of a box, the brain first puts together small pieces of information like color and shape. Then, it uses what we know to decide that it is a box.\n\nThe brain also decides which signals are important and which ones we should pay attention to. For example, when you look at your shoes, your brain doesn't notice every single blade of grass. But if someone says your name, you might hear it even in a noisy room.\n\nThe brain has different ways to store information. There are three types: sensory, working, and long-term memory. First, the brain must put the information into a form it can understand. There are different ways to do this, like looking at what a word looks like, hearing how it sounds, or knowing what it means.\n\nOnce the information is stored, the brain must keep it. Some studies with animals show that working memory, which lasts about 20 seconds, is like a signal in a special group of brain cells. Long-term memory is thought to be kept in the shape of certain proteins.\n\nThere are many ways to think about how the brain stores and uses information. Some ideas come from how people remember things, others come from computer science, and others come from studying the brain. One idea is that the brain uses nodes, like links in a chain, to connect related ideas. For example, \"chair\" might be connected to \"table,\" which is connected to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley wrote a book called Brave New World. It is a story about a bad future where people are controlled by a person called the World Controller. The people in this story do not value the individual. They value the community above all else. They are taught to be happy from a young age. But they are not really free. They are like pawns in a game.\n\nHuxley was afraid of a future where people are controlled by technology and money. He showed this in his story. The people in the story are not allowed to think for themselves. They do what they are told. They are not allowed to love or feel strong emotions. They just want to be happy and not be unhappy.\n\nHuxley used ideas from Marxism in his story. In Marxism, people who are poor and work hard are kept down by people who are rich and powerful. In Brave New World, the poor people are kept down by the World Controller and the rich people who are born with special bodies and brains. They call these people Alphas and Betas. They are in charge and the others have to do what they are told.\n\nThe people in the story do not know that they are being controlled. They just want to be happy and have fun. They do not know about the people who are in charge and how they are being controlled. Huxley showed this in his story. He made it seem like the people in the story are happy, but really they are not free.\n\nThe people in the story do not have relationships with each other. They just interact with each other in a shallow way. They do not love each other or feel deep emotions. They are just like machines. Huxley was showing how people can become like machines if they are controlled by technology and money.\n\nHuxley was warning people about the dangers of a future where people are controlled by technology and money. He showed how people can become like machines and lose their free will. He showed how people can be kept down by those in power and not know it.",
            "I have been a student here at University Park for two and a half years. Traveling on campus can be hard for many students, including me. My first year, I lived in an East Halls dorm room. It was far from the center of campus. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building, near the center, could take 25 minutes on foot. The weather in State College is often bad.\n\nI talked to an old student. He said that not long ago, East Halls was far from the rest of campus. Now, there are many new buildings and apartments. As the campus grows, getting from one place to another gets harder. The best way to solve mobility problems on campus is with a bike. But bikes alone are not enough. Students must ride them, and the campus must be made for bicyclists.\n\nI talked to a friend who rode a bike again after a few years. He said, “Bikes are great. They are the best way to get around.” Besides being good for your body, biking is the most efficient way to travel. I live off campus, not near the center of campus. Last year, I bought a bike. It was a smart decision. I have class in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home. If I ride my bike fast, it only takes 5 minutes. However, Pollock Road is not easy to ride on. I like biking because I am too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would take too much time. Every week, it would be over two and a half hours. I don’t have time for that."
